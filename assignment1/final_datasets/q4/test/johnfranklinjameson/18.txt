<s> thou art a righteous and a terrible god <\s>
<s> it is a righteous and an holy law that thou hast given unto us <\s>
<s> to break that good law and sin against thy infinite majesty can be no little evil <\s>
<s> thy word is always true and very particular that word of thine which has told us and warn'd us _evil pursueth sinners <\s>

<s> as a token and effect of their having accepted the righteousness of god let them heartily repent of all their sins against thee and abhor and cast up every morsel of their iniquity <\s>
<s> let them not go out of the world raging and raving against the justice of god and man and whatever part of the satanick image is yet remaining on their souls oh <\s>

<s> but shall our sea faring tribe on this occasion be in a singular manner affected with the warnings of god <\s>

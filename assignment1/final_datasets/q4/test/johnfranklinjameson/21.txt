<s> 147 footnote 10 samuel cranston governor 1698-1727 i being apprized of this their proceeding that since the cargo was condemned and the sale thereof appointed by the court of admiralty which issued upon informacions laid by the collector and surveyor of his majesty's plantation duties who had the sugars and cocoa in their custody and produced the negroes before me in court there was an order past by the governor and council or assistants at rhode island directed to the sheriffe who of before had been one of these who put an estimate upon the negroes by appointment of the judge of admiralty and to whom the judge had committed the custody of the negroes in court discharging him to deliver them up to the judges orders <\s>
<s> i went to rhode island though i had a deputy there and waited on the governor and shewed to him my _commission under the great seal of admiralty which also was recorded in their books and insisted with him on this that i am uncontrovertedly by my commission the competent judge in these parts upon the contravention of the acts of trade and moreover that by my commission i am obliged to enquire after and secure the goods of all pirates etc the words of my commission being _ad inquirendum et investigandum de omnibus et singulis bonis piratarum etc 11 and as i was authorize d for that effect so i conceived that the governor and his assistants their business was only to be aiding and assisting to me in the execution which i expected <\s>
<s> and therefore demanded of him that according to my order in court the negroes might be produced as formerly by the sheriffe in court in order to sale <\s>
<s> and that the publick court house and house where vendues are usually made may be made patent to me as heretofore and that the governor's order for shutting up thereof and denying access to me may be recalled <\s>
<s> at the same time i also informed him that i was accountable to the lords of admiralty or vice admiralty for the values and produce of the sales made by my decrees <\s>
<s> during this conference a quorum of his assistants in council came in before whom i again resumed my desire to which i received this answer that the governor _considers himself as vice admiral and that as such he hath right _to intromett with all goods belonging to pirates and that _by the charter all such is given to them and that he would not allow me the priviledge of the court house unless i would comply with and acquiesse in their acts of council <\s>
<s> to which i replyed _their charter contains no such grant of admiralty jurisdiction nor right to any piratical goods as will be evident on perusal thereof yea _in the year 1703/4 the queen discharged them from exercising any part of admiralty jurisdiction which was complyed with ever since and the court constitute by the kings commission 12 and as to submitting to their acts of council when derogatory to his majestys interest and the authority of his court of admiralty which i conceive their act of which i complain is was what i could not comply with without rendering my self unworthy of the trust committed to me and betraying thereof <\s>
<s> notwithstanding of all which they persisted in their resolution and not only debarred me from the use of the court house but also to deliver up the negroes etc to be sold as i had ordered and afterward sold them amongst themselves at an undervalue by which their contempt of his majesty's authority and court of admiralty is obvious yea their _incroaching upon and usurping of the admiralty jurisdiction contrary to queen ann's express order abovementioned is palpable and their refusing to give that aid and assistance which the judge did justly require of them in the terms of his commission appear to be highly punishable if not a just ground for forfeiture of their charter more especially being conjoyned with this of a great many of that colony their keeping a continued correspondence with the pirates which renders the fair traders very uneasy and insecure <\s>
<s> all which i humbly submit to their lordships consideration and pray for redress suitable encouragement and support to him who is sir your most humble servant j <\s>

<s> emot a lawyer of new-york came late at night to me and told me he came from captain kidd who was on the coast with a sloop but would not tell me where that kidd had brought 60 pound weight of gold about a 100 weight of silver and 17 bales of east-india goods which was less by 24 bales than we have since got in the sloop that kidd had left behind him a great ship near the coast of hispaniola that nobody but himselfe could find out on board whereof there were in bale goods saltpetre and other things to the value of at least 30,000 l that if i would give him a pardon he would bring in the sloop and goods hither and would go and fetch the great ship and goods afterwards <\s>
<s> emot delivered me that night two french passes which kidd took on board the two moors ships which were taken by him in the seas of india or as he alleges by his men against his will <\s>

<s> campbel returned hither on the 19 of june and gave in a memorial to my selfe and the councel containing what had passed between him and kidd the said memorial goes no <\s>
<s> 3 4 on the said 19 june as i sate in councel i wrote a letter to captain kidd and shewed it to the councel and they approving of it i dispatched mr <\s>

<s> your lordships may observe that the promise i make captain kidd in my said letter of a kind reception and promising the king's pardon for him is conditionall that is provided he were as innocent as he pretended to be <\s>
<s> but i quickly found sufficient cause to suspect him very guilty by the many lyes and contradictions he told me <\s>
<s> i was so much upon my guard with kidd that he arriving here on saturday the first of this moneth i would not see him but before witnesses nor have i ever seen him since but in councel twice or thrice that we examined him and the day he was taken up by the constable it happened to be by the door of my lodging 5 and he rushed in and came running to me the constable after him <\s>
<s> i had him not seized till thursday the 6th instant for i had a mind to discover where he had left the great ship and i thought my selfe secure enough from his running away because i took care not to give him the least umbrage of my design of seizing him nor had i till that day that i produced my orders from court for apprehending of kidd communicated them to anybody <\s>
<s> and i found it necessary to shew my orders to the councel to animate them to join heartily with me in securing kidd and examining his affair nicely to discover what we could of his behaviour in his whole voyage <\s>
<s> another reason why i took him not up sooner was that he had brought his wife and children hither in the sloop with him who i believed he would not easily forsake <\s>
<s> he being examined twice or thrice by me and the councel and also some of his men i observed he seemed much disturbed and the last time we examined him i fancied he looked as if he were upon the wing and resolved to run away and the gentlemen of the councel had some of them the same thought with mine so that i took their consent in seizing and committing him 6 but the officers appointed to seize his men were so careless as to let 3 or 4 of his men escape which troubled me the more because they were old new-york pyrates <\s>
<s> the next thing the councel and i did was to appoint a committee of trusty persons to search for the goods and treasure brought by kidd and to secure what they should find till the king's pleasure should be known as to the disposition thereof as my orders from mr <\s>
<s> the said committee were made up of two gentlemen of the councel two merchants and the deputy collector whose names are to the inclosed inventory of the goods and treasure <\s>

<s> in the above bag of gold were several litle bags of gold all particulars are i believe very justly and exactly set down in the inventory <\s>

<s> if the jewels be right as it is supposed they are but i never saw them nor the gold and silver brought by gardiner then we guesse that the parcel brought by him may be worth gold silver and jewels 4500 l <\s>
<s> and besides kidd had left six bales of goods with him one of which was twice as big as any of the rest and kidd gave him a particular charge of that bale and told him it was worth 2000 l <\s>

<s> for a sloop to carry him to gardiner's island and kidd having owned he had buried some gold on that island though he never mentioned to us any jewels nor i believe would he have owned the gold there but that he thought he should himselfe be sent for it i presently reflected that that man whom i have since discovered to be one of kidd's men was to defeat us of that treasure i privately posted away a messenger by land with a peremptory order to mr <\s>

<s> my messenger made great haste and was with gardiner before anybody and gardiner who is a very substantial man brought away the treasure without delay and by my direction delivered it into the hands of the committee <\s>
<s> if the jewels be right as it is supposed they are but i never saw them nor the gold and silver brought by gardiner then we guesse that the parcel brought by him may be worth gold silver and jewels 4500 l <\s>
<s> and besides kidd had left six bales of goods with him one of which was twice as big as any of the rest and kidd gave him a particular charge of that bale and told him it was worth 2000 l <\s>
<s> the six bales gardiner could not bring but i have ordered him to send them by a sloop that is since gone from hence to new york and which is to return speedily <\s>
<s> we are not able to set an exact value on the goods and treasure we have got because we have not opened the bales we took on board the sloop but we hope when the six bales are sent in by gardiner what will be then in the hands of the gentlemen appointed to that trust will amount to about 14000 l <\s>

<s> i was so much upon my guard with kidd that he arriving here on saturday the first of this moneth i would not see him but before witnesses nor have i ever seen him since but in councel twice or thrice that we examined him and the day he was taken up by the constable it happened to be by the door of my lodging 5 and he rushed in and came running to me the constable after him <\s>

<s> he being examined twice or thrice by me and the councel and also some of his men i observed he seemed much disturbed and the last time we examined him i fancied he looked as if he were upon the wing and resolved to run away and the gentlemen of the councel had some of them the same thought with mine so that i took their consent in seizing and committing him 6 but the officers appointed to seize his men were so careless as to let 3 or 4 of his men escape which troubled me the more because they were old new-york pyrates <\s>

<s> for a sloop to carry him to gardiner's island and kidd having owned he had buried some gold on that island though he never mentioned to us any jewels nor i believe would he have owned the gold there but that he thought he should himselfe be sent for it i presently reflected that that man whom i have since discovered to be one of kidd's men was to defeat us of that treasure i privately posted away a messenger by land with a peremptory order to mr <\s>

<s> my messenger made great haste and was with gardiner before anybody and gardiner who is a very substantial man brought away the treasure without delay and by my direction delivered it into the hands of the committee <\s>
<s> if the jewels be right as it is supposed they are but i never saw them nor the gold and silver brought by gardiner then we guesse that the parcel brought by him may be worth gold silver and jewels 4500 l <\s>
<s> and besides kidd had left six bales of goods with him one of which was twice as big as any of the rest and kidd gave him a particular charge of that bale and told him it was worth 2000 l <\s>
<s> the six bales gardiner could not bring but i have ordered him to send them by a sloop that is since gone from hence to new york and which is to return speedily <\s>
<s> we are not able to set an exact value on the goods and treasure we have got because we have not opened the bales we took on board the sloop but we hope when the six bales are sent in by gardiner what will be then in the hands of the gentlemen appointed to that trust will amount to about 14000 l <\s>

<s> i was so much upon my guard with kidd that he arriving here on saturday the first of this moneth i would not see him but before witnesses nor have i ever seen him since but in councel twice or thrice that we examined him and the day he was taken up by the constable it happened to be by the door of my lodging 5 and he rushed in and came running to me the constable after him <\s>

<s> he being examined twice or thrice by me and the councel and also some of his men i observed he seemed much disturbed and the last time we examined him i fancied he looked as if he were upon the wing and resolved to run away and the gentlemen of the councel had some of them the same thought with mine so that i took their consent in seizing and committing him 6 but the officers appointed to seize his men were so careless as to let 3 or 4 of his men escape which troubled me the more because they were old new-york pyrates <\s>

<s> i have sent to search elsewhere a certain place strongly suspected to have received another depositum of gold from kidd <\s>
<s> i am also upon the hunt after two or three arch pyrates which i hope to give your lordships a good account of by next conveyance <\s>
<s> if i could have but a good able judge and attorney general at york a man of war there and another here and the companies recruited and well paid i will rout pirates and piracy entirely out of all this north part of america but as i have but too often told your lordships it is impossible for me to do all this alone in my single person <\s>

<s> 79 i wrot your lordships word in my last letter of the 8 instant that bradish the pyrate and one of his crew were escaped out of the goal of this town <\s>
<s> we have since found that the goaler was bradish's kinsman and the goaler confessed they went out at the prison door and that he found it wide open we had all the reason in the world to believe the goaler was consenting to the escape by much ado i could get the counsel to resent the goaler's behaviour but by meer importunity i had the fellow before us we examined him and by his own story and accounts given us of his suffering other prisoners formerly to escape i prevailed to have him turned out and a prosecution ordered against him to the attorney generall <\s>
<s> i have also with some difficulty this late session of assembly here got a bill to pass that the goal be committed to the care of the high sheriffe of the county as in england with a salary of 30 l <\s>
<s> _per annum to the said sheriffe i would have had it 50 l <\s>

<s> he has without doubt a great deal of gold which is apt to tempt men that have not principles of honour i have therefore to try the power of dull iron against gold put him into irons that weigh 16 pound <\s>
<s> i thought it moderate enough for i remember poor doctor oates 10 had a 100 weight of iron on him when he was a prisoner in the late raign <\s>
<s> there never was a greater lyar or thief in the world than this kidd notwithstanding he assured the councel and me every time we examined him that the great ship and her cargo waited his return to bring her hither and now your lordships will see by two severall informations of masters of ships from curacao that the cargo has been sold there and in one of them it is said they have burnt that noble ship and without doubt it was by kidd's order that the ship might not be an evidence against him for he would not own to us her name was the _quidah marchand though his men did <\s>
<s> andries henlyne and two more brought the first news to york of the sale of that cargo at curacao and never such pennyworths heard of for cheapness captain evertz is he who has brought the news of the ship's being burnt <\s>
<s> she was of about 500 ton and kidd told us at the councel there never was a stronger or stancher ship seen <\s>
<s> his lying had like to have involved me in a contract that would have been very chargeable and to no manner of purpose as he has ordered matters <\s>
<s> i was advised by counsel to dispatch a ship of good countenance to go and fetch away that ship and cargo <\s>
<s> i had agreed for a ship of 300 tons 22 guns and i was to man her with 60 men to force if there had been need of it the men to yield who were left with the ship <\s>
<s> i was just going to seal the writing when i bethought myself it were best to presse kidd once more to tell me truth i therefore sent to him two gentlemen of the councel to the goal and he at last owned that he had left a power with one mr <\s>

<s> i hope your lordships will take care that immediate orders be sent to antegoa to secure bolton who must have plaid the knave egregiously for he could not but know that kidd came knavishly by that ship and goods <\s>

<s> the settlement had proved a disastrous failure and had been abandoned and the ships bringing away the wretched survivors were already approaching new york but neither kidd nor bellomont yet knew this i desire i may have orders what to do with kidd and all his and bradish's crew for as the law stands in this country if a pyrate were convict yet he cannot suffer death and the counsell here refused the bill to punish privateers and pyrates which your lordships sent with me from england with a direction to recommend it at new york and here to be passed into a law <\s>

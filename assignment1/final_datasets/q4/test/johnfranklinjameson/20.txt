<s> as far as i have observed during the course of the wars with holland france and spain the high court of admiralty have proceeded in all prize causes by virtue of warrants from the lord high admiral or commissioners for executing that office in pursuance of commissions under the great seal directed to them for that purpose ;[ 4 and commissioners were appointed at the severall plantations to take the examinations of witnesses in preparatory and to transmit them hither together with the ships papers and in case the ship and goods were perishable they had a power to appraise and sell and keep the produce in their hands till after sentence that the merchants might have time and be at a certainty where to enter their claims <\s>

<s> therefore upon a grant of new powers i must humbly submit it to their lordships consideration whether it may be for the honour and service of his majesty to permit the vice-admiralty courts in the plantations to proceed in prize causes since it is much to be feared they are not well versed in the laws of nations and treaties between us and other states and it is well known that they do not proceed in that regular manner as is practised in his majesties high court of admiralty besides it will be a considerable time before orders from their lordships upon any emergency can reach the vice admiralty courts in the plantations for want of which great inconveniences may arise whereas the admiralty court here is under their lordships eye and immediate direction and always ready to observe such instructions as the nature of affairs shall require <\s>

<s> i know the treatment <\s>
<s> there come three loud knocks on the door <\s>
<s> wellwyn and ann exchange a glance of consternation ann <\s>
<s> it sounds like sir thomas <\s>
<s> nodding awfully sorry professor <\s>
<s> you see we calway <\s>
<s> only i must decline to be involved in argument with him please <\s>
<s> we might get his opinion don't you think <\s>
<s> on a point of reform <\s>
<s> deprecating my dear sir we needn't take it <\s>
<s> the three knocks resound with extraordinary fury ann <\s>
<s> you'd better open the door daddy <\s>
<s> wellwyn opens the door <\s>
<s> sir thomas hoxton is disclosed in a fur overcoat and top hat <\s>
<s> his square well coloured face is remarkable for a massive jaw dominating all that comes above it <\s>
<s> his voice is resolute hoxton <\s>
<s> afraid i didn't make myself heard <\s>
<s> so good of you to come sir thomas <\s>
<s> they greet professor calway you know i think <\s>
<s> an awkward pause ann <\s>
<s> blurting it out that old cabman i told you of's been drinking father's rum <\s>
<s> we were just discussing what's to be done with him sir thomas <\s>
<s> one wants to do the very best of course <\s>
<s> the question of reform is always delicate <\s>
<s> i beg your pardon <\s>
<s> there is no question here <\s>
<s> is he in the house <\s>
<s> works for you eh <\s>
<s> let's have a look at him <\s>
<s> an embarrassed pause bertley <\s>
<s> well the fact is sir thomas calway <\s>
<s> when last under observation ann <\s>
<s> he was sitting on the floor <\s>
<s> i don't want the old fellow to feel he's being made a show of <\s>
<s> disgusting to be spied at ann <\s>
<s> never mind miss wellwyn <\s>
<s> hundreds of these fellows before me in my time <\s>
<s> at calway the only thing is a sharp lesson <\s>
<s> i've seen the man what he requires is steady control and the bobbins treatment <\s>
<s> wellwyn approaches them with fearful interest hoxton <\s>
<s> not a bit of it <\s>
<s> he wants one for his knob <\s>
<s> it's the only thing <\s>
<s> personally i think that if he were spoken to seriously calway <\s>
<s> i cannot walk arm in arm with a crab <\s>
<s> approaching calway i beg your pardon <\s>
<s> moving back a little you're moving backwards sir thomas <\s>
<s> i've told you before convinced reactionaryism in these days there comes a single knock on the street door bertley <\s>
<s> looking at his watch d'you know i'm rather afraid this may be our young husband wellwyn <\s>
<s> i told him half past four <\s>
<s> going towards the two reformers shall we go into the house professor and settle the question quietly while the vicar sees a young man <\s>
<s> pale with uncompleted statement and gravitating insensibly in the direction indicated the merest sense of continuity a simple instinct for order hoxton <\s>
<s> following the only way to get order sir is to bring the disorderly up with a round turn <\s>
<s> calway turns to him in the doorway you people without practical experience calway <\s>
<s> if you'll listen to me a minute <\s>
<s> i can show you in a mo they vanish through the door wellwyn <\s>
<s> i was afraid of it <\s>
<s> the two points of view <\s>
<s> pleasant to see such keenness <\s>
<s> i may want you wellwyn <\s>
<s> and ann perhaps had better not be present <\s>
<s> wellwyn opens the street door <\s>
<s> the lamp outside has just been lighted and by its gleam is seen the figure of rory megan thin pale youthful <\s>
<s> ann turning at the door into the house gives him a long inquisitive look then goes wellwyn <\s>
<s> there follows an awkward silence during which wellwyn turns up the light then goes to the tea table and pours out a glass of tea and rum bertley <\s>
<s> kindly now my boy how is it that you and your wife are living apart like this <\s>
<s> well if you don't none of us are very likely to are we <\s>
<s> that's what i thought as i was comin along <\s>
<s> twinkling have some tea megan <\s>
<s> handing him the glass what d'you think of her picture <\s>
<s> after scrutiny i seen her look like it once <\s>
<s> stoically when she ad the measles <\s>
<s> i quite see feverish <\s>
<s> my dear wellwyn let me to megan now i hope you're willing to come together again and to maintain her <\s>
<s> if she'll maintain me <\s>
<s> but i see you mean you're in the same line of business <\s>
<s> and lean on each other <\s>
<s> i leans on er mostly with er looks <\s>
<s> sometimes she'll take arf a crown off of a toff <\s>
<s> he looks at wellwyn wellwyn <\s>
<s> twinkling i apologise to you megan <\s>
<s> with a faint smile i could do with a bit more of it <\s>
<s> now my boy i've heard you bet on horses <\s>
<s> don't be afraid to acknowledge it <\s>
<s> when i'm ard up yus <\s>
<s> but don't you know that's ruination <\s>
<s> sometimes i wins a lot <\s>
<s> you know that's not at all what i mean <\s>
<s> come promise me to give it up <\s>

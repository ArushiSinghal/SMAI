<s> wives are liars by law <\s>
<s> staring down at her what do you mean court <\s>
<s> my dear he'll have to bring an action for defamation of character or whatever they call it <\s>
<s> were they talking of this last night at the winsor's <\s>
<s> well you know a dinner table mabel scandal is heaven sent at this time of year <\s>
<s> it's terrible such a thing terrible <\s>
<s> gloomily if only ronny weren't known to be so broke <\s>
<s> with her hands to her forehead i can't realise i simply can't <\s>
<s> if there's a case would it be all right afterwards <\s>

<s> ye es but loyalties cut up against each other sometimes you know <\s>
<s> i must see ronny <\s>
<s> d'you mind if i go and try to get him on the telephone <\s>
<s> mabel goes out by the door left <\s>
<s> she curls herself into a corner of the sofa as if trying to get away from life <\s>
<s> if he told me i didn't take it in <\s>
<s> this concerns the honour of the club <\s>
<s> are you going to take action <\s>
<s> slowly that is a very expensive business lord st erth and i'm hard up <\s>
<s> i must think it over <\s>
<s> he looks round from face to face am i to take it that there is a doubt in your minds gentlemen <\s>
<s> that's not the question dancy <\s>
<s> this accusation was overheard by various members and we represent the club <\s>
<s> if you don't take action judgment will naturally go by default <\s>
<s> i might prefer to look on the whole thing as beneath contempt <\s>
<s> he turns and goes out <\s>
<s> when he is gone there is an even longer silence than after de levis's departure <\s>
<s> abruptly i don't like it <\s>
<s> i've known him all his life <\s>
<s> you may have my head if he did it lord st erth <\s>
<s> he and i have been in too many holes together <\s>
<s> my toe itches for that fellow's butt end <\s>
<s> i'm sorry but has he t taken it in quite the right way <\s>
<s> i should have thought hearing it s suddenly colford <\s>
<s> it's perfectly damnable for him <\s>
<s> more damnable if he did it winsor <\s>
<s> the courts are b beastly distrustful don't you know <\s>
<s> his word's good enough for me <\s>
<s> we're as anxious to believe dancy as you colford for the honour of the army and the club <\s>
<s> of course he'll bring a case when he's thought it over <\s>
<s> what are we to do in the meantime <\s>
<s> if dancy's asked to resign you may take my resignation too <\s>
<s> i thought his wanting to f fight him a bit screeny <\s>
<s> wouldn't you have wanted a shot at the brute <\s>
<s> what'll be his position even if he wins <\s>
<s> damages and a stain on his c character <\s>
<s> quite so unless they find the real thief <\s>
<s> people always believe the worst <\s>
<s> glaring at borring they do <\s>
<s> there is no decent way out of a thing of this sort <\s>
<s> rising it leaves a bad taste <\s>
<s> i'm sorry for young mrs dancy poor woman <\s>
<s> are you going to play any more <\s>
<s> good night to you <\s>
<s> canynge can i give you a lift <\s>
<s> he goes out followed by canynge <\s>
<s> after a slight pause well i shall go and take the t temperature of the club <\s>
<s> damn that effeminate stammering chap <\s>
<s> what can we do for dancy winsor <\s>
<s> a slight pause the general felt his coat sleeve that night and it was wet <\s>
<s> an old school fellow a brother officer and a pal <\s>
<s> if he did do it colford <\s>
<s> but if he did i'd stick to him and see him through it if i could <\s>
<s> winsor walks over to the fire stares into it turns round and stares at colford who is standing motionless <\s>
<s> scene ii note this should be a small set capable of being set quickly within that of the previous scene morning of the following day <\s>
<s> in the sitting room of this small abode mabel dancy and margaret orme are sitting full face to the audience on a couch in the centre of the room in front of the imaginary window <\s>
<s> there is a fireplace left with fire burning a door below it left and a door on the right facing the audience leads to a corridor and the outer door of the flat which is visible <\s>
<s> their voices are heard in rapid exchange then as the curtain rises so does mabel <\s>
<s> she lights a cigarette and hands the case to mabel who however sees nothing but her own thoughts de levis might just as well have pitched on me except that i can't jump more than six inches in these skirts <\s>
<s> yesterday afternoon at the club did you say <\s>
<s> ronny hasn't said a word to me <\s>
<s> with a long puff of smoke doesn't want you bothered <\s>
<s> haven't you found out mabel that he isn't exactly communicative <\s>
<s> no desperate character is <\s>
<s> wives are at a disadvantage especially early on <\s>
<s> you've never hunted with him my dear <\s>
<s> he takes more sudden decisions than any man i ever knew <\s>
<s> he's taking one now i'll bet <\s>
<s> that beast de levis <\s>

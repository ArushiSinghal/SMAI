<s> yes sir but may i say something <\s>
<s> i had a lot of time to think it over in prison <\s>

<s> yes sir but may i say something <\s>
<s> i had a lot of time to think it over in prison <\s>

<s> if society didn't take care of itself nobody would the sooner you realise that the better <\s>
<s> yes sir but may i say something <\s>
<s> i had a lot of time to think it over in prison <\s>
<s> encouraging him i'm sure you did <\s>
<s> there were all sorts there <\s>
<s> and what i mean sir is that if we'd been treated differently the first time and put under somebody that could look after us a bit and not put in prison not a quarter of us would ever have got there <\s>

<s> now lay aside all those thoughts falder and look to the future <\s>
<s> almost eagerly yes sir but you don't understand what prison is <\s>

<s> yes but my dear fellow that'll pass away <\s>
<s> with his face twitching i hope so sir <\s>
<s> much more gently now my boy what you've got to do is to put all the past behind you and build yourself up a steady reputation <\s>

<s> she is breathing as if she had been running hard <\s>
<s> she lifts her eyes <\s>
<s> the tall young man divested of hat and coat is standing by her table holding out his hand with a sort of bashful hardiness <\s>
<s> didn't recognize you at first <\s>
<s> so sorry awfully rude of me <\s>
<s> clare's eyes seem to fly from him to appeal to him to resign herself all at once <\s>
<s> something in the young man responds <\s>
<s> he drops his hand <\s>
<s> faintly how d'you do <\s>
<s> stammering you you been down there to day <\s>
<s> with a smile the derby <\s>
<s> don't you generally go down <\s>
<s> he touches the other chair may i <\s>
<s> almost in a whisper yes <\s>
<s> as he sits down arnaud returns and stands before them <\s>
<s> the plovers eggs veree good to night sare <\s>
<s> a peach or two after <\s>
<s> the roederer sare not bad at all <\s>
<s> madame likes it frappe but not too cold yes <\s>
<s> he is away again to his service table young man <\s>
<s> burying his face in the carnations i say these are jolly aren't they <\s>
<s> they do you pretty well here <\s>
<s> you've never been here <\s>
<s> clare shakes her head by jove <\s>
<s> i thought i didn't know your face <\s>
<s> clare looks full at him <\s>
<s> again something moves in the young man and he stammers i mean not clare <\s>
<s> respectfully of course if i if you were waiting for anybody or anything i he half rises clare <\s>
<s> it's all right thank you <\s>
<s> the young man sits down again uncomfortable nonplussed <\s>
<s> there is silence broken by the inaudible words of the languid lord and the distant merriment of the supper party <\s>
<s> arnaud brings the plovers eggs <\s>
<s> abruptly don't you ever go racing then <\s>
<s> arnaud pours out champagne young man <\s>
<s> i remember awfully well my first day <\s>
<s> it was pretty thick lost every blessed bob and my watch and chain playin three cards on the way home <\s>
<s> everything has a beginning hasn't it <\s>
<s> the young man stares at her young man <\s>
<s> floundering in these waters deeper than he had bargained for i say about things having beginnings did you mean anything <\s>
<s> clare nods young man <\s>
<s> d'you mean it's really the first <\s>
<s> the champagne has flicked her courage <\s>
<s> he leans back i've often wondered <\s>
<s> again filling the glasses monsieur finds young man <\s>
<s> abruptly it's all right <\s>
<s> he drains his glass then sits bolt upright <\s>
<s> chivalry and the camaraderie of class have begun to stir in him <\s>
<s> of course i can see that you're not i mean that you're a a lady <\s>
<s> clare smiles and i say you know if you have to because you're in a hole i should feel a cad <\s>
<s> let me lend you <\s>
<s> holding up her glass le vin est tire il faut le boire <\s>
<s> the french words which he does not too well understand completing his conviction that she is a lady he remains quite silent frowning <\s>
<s> as clare held up her glass two gentlemen have entered <\s>
<s> the first is blond of good height and a comely insolence <\s>
<s> his crisp fair hair and fair brushed up moustache are just going grey an eyeglass is fixed in one of two eyes that lord it over every woman they see his face is broad and coloured with air and wine <\s>
<s> his companion is a tall thin dark bird of the night with sly roving eyes and hollow cheeks <\s>

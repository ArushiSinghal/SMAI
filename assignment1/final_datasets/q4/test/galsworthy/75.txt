<s> ronny what bad luck <\s>
<s> he must have been followed here <\s>
<s> at the window after rain like that there ought to be footmarks <\s>
<s> the splutter of a motor cycle is heard <\s>
<s> what's the move now general <\s>
<s> you and i had better see the inspector in de levis's room winsor <\s>
<s> to the others if you'll all be handy in case he wants to put questions for himself <\s>
<s> i hope he'll want me it's just too thrilling <\s>
<s> i hope he won't want me i'm dog tired <\s>
<s> he puts his arm in his wife's <\s>
<s> just a minute charles <\s>
<s> he draws dose to winsor as the others are departing to their rooms <\s>
<s> we must be careful with this inspector fellow <\s>
<s> if he pitches hastily on somebody in the house it'll be very disagreeable <\s>
<s> we don't want to rouse any ridiculous suspicion <\s>
<s> a knock come in <\s>
<s> robert is in readiness sir but i could swear he knows nothing about it <\s>
<s> treisure re opens the door and says come in please <\s>
<s> the inspector enters blue formal moustachioed with a peaked cap in his hand <\s>
<s> sorry to have brought you out at this time of night <\s>
<s> you're the owner here i think <\s>
<s> i understand a large sum of money <\s>
<s> shall we go straight to the room it was taken from <\s>
<s> one of my guests mr de levis <\s>
<s> it's the third room on the left <\s>
<s> we've not been in there yet inspector in fact we've done nothing except to find out that the stable ladder has not been moved <\s>
<s> we haven't even searched the grounds <\s>
<s> right sir i've brought a man with me <\s>
<s> and interval of a minute <\s>
<s> scene ii the same set is used for this scene with the different arrangement of furniture as specified the bedroom of de levis is the same in shape as winsor's dressing room except that there is only one door to the corridor <\s>
<s> the furniture however is differently arranged a small four poster bedstead stands against the wall right back jutting into the room <\s>
<s> a chair on which de levis's clothes are thrown stands at its foot <\s>
<s> there is a dressing table against the wall to the left of the open windows where the curtains are drawn back and a stone balcony is seen <\s>
<s> against the wall to the right of the window is a chest of drawers and a washstand is against the wall left <\s>
<s> on a small table to the right of the bed an electric reading lamp is turned up and there is a light over the dressing table <\s>
<s> the inspector is standing plumb centre looking at the bed and de levis by the back of the chair at the foot of the bed <\s>
<s> winsor and canynge are close to the door right forward <\s>
<s> finishing a note now sir if this is the room as you left it for your bath just show us exactly what you did after takin the pocket book from the suit case <\s>
<s> where was that by the way <\s>
<s> pointing where it is now under the dressing table <\s>
<s> he comes forward to the front of the chair opens the pocket book goes through the pretence of counting his shaving papers closes the pocket book takes it to the head of the bed and slips it under the pillow <\s>
<s> makes the motion of taking up his pyjamas crosses below the inspector to the washstand takes up a bath sponge crosses to the door takes out the key opens the door <\s>
<s> we now have the room as it was when the theft was committed <\s>
<s> reconstruct accordin to uman nature gentlemen assumin the thief to be in the room what would he try first the clothes the dressin' table the suit case the chest of drawers and last the bed <\s>
<s> he moves accordingly examining the glass on the dressing table the surface of the suit cases and the handles of the drawers with a spy glass for finger marks <\s>
<s> sotto voce to winsor the order would have been just the other way <\s>
<s> the inspector goes on hands and knees and examines the carpet between the window and the bed <\s>
<s> can i come in again <\s>
<s> standing up did you open the window sir or was it open when you first came in <\s>
<s> drawin the curtains back first <\s>
<s> sharply are you sure there was nobody in the room already <\s>
<s> taken aback i don't know <\s>
<s> i didn't look under the bed if you mean that <\s>
<s> jotting did not look under bed <\s>
<s> did you look under it after the theft <\s>
<s> now what did you do after you came back from your bath <\s>
<s> just give us that precisely <\s>
<s> locked the door and left the key in <\s>
<s> put back my sponge and took off my dressing gown and put it there <\s>
<s> he points to the footrails of the bed then i drew the curtains again <\s>
<s> i got into bed felt for my watch to see the time <\s>
<s> my hand struck the pocket book and somehow it felt thinner <\s>
<s> i took it out looked into it and found the notes gone and these shaving papers instead <\s>
<s> let me have a look at those sir <\s>
<s> he applies the spy glasses and then <\s>
<s> i think i just sat on the bed <\s>
<s> thinkin and cursin a bit i suppose <\s>
<s> then i put on my dressing gown and went straight to mr winsor <\s>
<s> not lockin the door <\s>
<s> with a certain finality now sir what time did you come up <\s>
<s> precise if you can give it me <\s>
<s> well i know it was eleven fifteen when i put my watch under my pillow before i went to the bath and i suppose i'd been about a quarter of an hour undressing <\s>
<s> i should say after eleven if anything <\s>
<s> didn't look over your bettin book <\s>
<s> no prayers or anything <\s>
<s> pretty slippy with your undressin as a rule <\s>
<s> say five past eleven <\s>
<s> mr winsor what time did the gentleman come to you <\s>
<s> how do you fix that sir <\s>
<s> i'd just looked at the time and told my wife to send her maid off <\s>
<s> then we've got it fixed between 11.15 and 11.30 <\s>
<s> jots now sir before we go further i'd like to see your butler and the footman that valets this gentleman <\s>
<s> with distaste very well inspector only my butler has been with us from a boy <\s>
<s> this is just clearing the ground sir <\s>
<s> general d'you mind touching that bell <\s>
<s> canynge rings a bell by the bed <\s>
<s> well gentlemen there are four possibilities <\s>
<s> either the thief was here all the time waiting under the bed and slipped out after this gentleman had gone to mr winsor <\s>
<s> or he came in with a key that fits the lock and i'll want to see all the keys in the house <\s>
<s> or he came in with a skeleton key and out by the window probably droppin from the balcony <\s>
<s> or he came in by the window with a rope or ladder and out the same way <\s>
<s> pointing there's a footmark here from a big boot which has been out of doors since it rained <\s>
<s> inspector you er walked up to the window when you first came into the room <\s>
<s> stiffly i had not overlooked that general <\s>
<s> a knock on the door relieves a certain tension winsor <\s>
<s> the footman robert a fresh faced young man enters followed by treisure <\s>
<s> you valet mr mr de levis i think <\s>
<s> at what time did you take his clothes and boots <\s>
<s> with a pounce did you happen to look under his bed <\s>
<s> did you come up again to bring the clothes back <\s>

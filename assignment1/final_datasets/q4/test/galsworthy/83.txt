<s> putting her hand on his head yes oh yes <\s>
<s> i think i've known a long time really <\s>
<s> getting up and speaking in jerks it was a crazy thing to do; but damn it i was only looting a looter <\s>
<s> the money was as much mine as his <\s>
<s> a decent chap would have offered me half <\s>
<s> you didn't see the brute look at me that night at dinner as much as to say you blasted fool <\s>
<s> it made me mad <\s>
<s> that wasn't a bad jump twice over <\s>
<s> nothing in the war took quite such nerve <\s>
<s> grimly i rather enjoyed that evening <\s>
<s> sullenly yes but i had a debt to pay <\s>
<s> a debt of honour it wouldn't wait <\s>
<s> it was it was to a woman <\s>
<s> ronny don't lie any more <\s>
<s> i wanted to save your knowing <\s>
<s> i'd promised a thousand <\s>
<s> i had a letter from her father that morning threatening to tell you <\s>
<s> all the same if that tyke hadn't jeered at me for parlour tricks but what's the good of all this now <\s>
<s> sullenly well it may cure you of loving me <\s>
<s> get over that mab i never was worth it and i'm done for <\s>
<s> but if you'd known i was leaving a woman for you you'd never have married me <\s>
<s> he walks over to the hearth <\s>

<s> have you ever given evidence <\s>
<s> it must be too frightfully thrilling <\s>
<s> why did i ever ask that wretch de levis <\s>
<s> i used to think him pathetic <\s>
<s> meg did you know  ronald dancy's coat was wet <\s>
<s> the general happened to feel it <\s>
<s> so that's why he was so silent <\s>

<s> what do you say doctor clements <\s>
<s> he doesn't like it but it's not doing him any harm <\s>
<s> but he's told me <\s>
<s> of course he'd say so but we can always tell <\s>
<s> he's lost no weight since he's been here <\s>
<s> it's his state of mind i'm speaking of <\s>
<s> his mind's all right so far <\s>
<s> he's nervous rather melancholy <\s>
<s> i don't see signs of anything more <\s>

<s> i'll make a point of seeing him to day <\s>
<s> i'm much obliged to you <\s>
<s> i thought perhaps seeing him every day you wouldn't notice it <\s>
<s> rather sharply if any sign of injury to his health shows itself his case will be reported at once <\s>
<s> that's fully provided for <\s>
<s> following his own thoughts of course what you don't see doesn't trouble you but having seen him i don't want to have him on my mind <\s>
<s> i think you may safely leave it to us sir <\s>
<s> and she asked me to come <\s>
<s> well i take an interest in him <\s>
<s> he was our junior i go to the same chapel and i didn't like to refuse <\s>
<s> and what i wanted to tell you was he seems lonely here <\s>
<s> i'm afraid it'll prey on my mind <\s>
<s> i see a lot of them about working together <\s>
<s> those are local prisoners <\s>
<s> the convicts serve their three months here in separate confinement sir <\s>
<s> but we don't want to be unreasonable <\s>
<s> i wanted to ask you to let him run about with the others <\s>
<s> with faint amusement ring the bell would you miller <\s>
<s> to cokeson you'd like to hear what the doctor says about him perhaps <\s>
<s> ringing the bell you are not accustomed to prisons it would seem sir <\s>
<s> but it's a pitiful sight <\s>
<s> he's quite a young fellow <\s>
<s> i said to him before a month's up i said you'll be out and about with the others it'll be a nice change for you <\s>
<s> he said like that <\s>
<s> i said we mustn't exaggerate <\s>
<s> a day he said shut up in your cell thinking and brooding as i do it's longer than a year outside <\s>
<s> i can't help it he said i try but i'm built that way mr <\s>
<s> and he held his hand up to his face <\s>
<s> i could see the tears trickling through his fingers <\s>
<s> he's a young man with large rather peculiar eyes isn't he <\s>
<s> not church of england i think <\s>
<s> to wooder who has come in ask the doctor to be good enough to come here for a minute <\s>
<s> wooder salutes and goes out let's see he's not married <\s>
<s> confidentially but there's a party he's very much attached to not altogether com il fa <\s>
<s> it's a sad story <\s>
<s> if it wasn't for drink and women sir this prison might be closed <\s>
<s> looking at the chaplain over his spectacles ye es but i wanted to tell you about that special <\s>
<s> he had hopes they'd have let her come and see him but they haven't <\s>
<s> of course he asked me questions <\s>
<s> i did my best but i couldn't tell the poor young fellow a lie with him in here seemed like hitting him <\s>
<s> but i'm afraid it's made him worse <\s>
<s> what was this news then <\s>
<s> the woman had a nahsty spiteful feller for a husband and she'd left him <\s>
<s> fact is she was going away with our young friend <\s>
<s> it's not nice but i've looked over it <\s>
<s> well when he was put in here she said she'd earn her living apart and wait for him to come out <\s>
<s> that was a great consolation to him <\s>
<s> but after a month she came to me i don't know her personally and she said i can't earn the children's living let alone my own i've got no friends <\s>
<s> i'm obliged to keep out of everybody's way else my husband'd get to know where i was <\s>
<s> i'm very much reduced she said <\s>
<s> and she has lost flesh <\s>
<s> i'll have to go in the workhouse <\s>
<s> it's a painful story <\s>
<s> i said to her no i said not that <\s>
<s> i've got a wife an family but sooner than you should do that i'll spare you a little myself <\s>
<s> really she said she's a nice creature i don't like to take it from you <\s>
<s> i think i'd better go back to my husband <\s>
<s> well i know he's a nahsty spiteful feller drinks but i didn't like to persuade her not to <\s>

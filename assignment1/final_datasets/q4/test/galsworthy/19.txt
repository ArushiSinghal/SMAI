<s> he is a tall good looking edition of his father with the same stubborn look of veiled choler <\s>
<s> and as she shrinks still further back what's the matter <\s>
<s> then at some sound he looks round uneasily and draws away from her aren't you glad to see me <\s>
<s> i've something to say to you mr <\s>
<s> she passes him and rushes away upstairs <\s>
<s> and bill who stands frowning and looking after her recovers himself sharply as the drawing room door is opened and sir william and miss lanfarne come forth followed by keith dot harold christine latter and joan all leaning across each other and talking <\s>
<s> by herself behind them comes lady cheshire a refined looking woman of fifty with silvery dark hair and an expression at once gentle and ironic <\s>
<s> they move across the hall towards the dining room <\s>
<s> how do you do <\s>
<s> how are you old chap <\s>
<s> gloomily do you know your part <\s>
<s> christine gives her brother a flying kiss <\s>
<s> joan and latter pause and look at him shyly without speech <\s>
<s> putting his hand on joan's shoulder good luck you two <\s>
<s> well my dear boy <\s>
<s> nice to see you at last <\s>
<s> what a long time <\s>
<s> she draws his arm through hers and they move towards the dining room <\s>
<s> the curtain rises again at once <\s>
<s> scene ii christine lady cheshire dot mabel lanfarne and joan are returning to the hall after dinner <\s>
<s> in a low voice mother is it true about young dunning and rose taylor <\s>
<s> i'm afraid so dear <\s>
<s> but can't they be dot <\s>
<s> christine and her mother are silent my child i'm not the young person <\s>
<s> no of course not only nodding towards joan and mable <\s>
<s> this is just an instance of what i hate <\s>
<s> yes mother and don't you pretend you don't understand because you know you do <\s>
<s> joan and mabel have ceased talking and listen still at the fire <\s>
<s> why should you want them to marry if he's tired of her <\s>
<s> if your imagination doesn't carry you as far as that <\s>
<s> when people marry do you believe they ought to be in love with each other <\s>
<s> with a shrug that's not the point <\s>
<s> were you in love with ronny <\s>
<s> would you have married him if you hadn't been <\s>
<s> don't shut me up mother <\s>
<s> to joan are you in love with john <\s>
<s> joan turns hurriedly to the fire would you be going to marry him if you were not <\s>
<s> you are a brute dot <\s>
<s> is mabel in love with whoever she is in love with <\s>
<s> and i wonder who that is <\s>
<s> well would you marry him if you weren't <\s>
<s> no i would not <\s>
<s> now mother did you love father <\s>
<s> dot you really are awful <\s>
<s> rueful and detached well it is a bit too thick perhaps <\s>
<s> well mother did you i mean quite calmly <\s>
<s> yes dear quite calmly <\s>
<s> would you have married him if you hadn't <\s>
<s> lady cheshire shakes her head then we're all agreed <\s>
<s> grimly even if i loved him he might think himself lucky if i married him <\s>
<s> indeed and i'm not so sure <\s>
<s> making a face at her what i was going to lady cheshire <\s>
<s> but don't you think dear you'd better not <\s>
<s> well i won't say what i was going to say but what i do say is why the devil lady cheshire <\s>
<s> a little disconcerted if they're tired of each other they ought not to marry and if father's going to make them christine <\s>
<s> you don't understand in the least <\s>
<s> it's for the sake of the dot <\s>
<s> out with it old sweetness <\s>
<s> there is a sudden silence for keith and latter are seen coming from the dining room <\s>
<s> that must be so ronny <\s>
<s> no john not a bit of it <\s>
<s> good gad who wants to think after dinner <\s>
<s> she turns at the billiard room door look here <\s>
<s> rehearsal to morrow is directly after breakfast from eccles enters breathless to the end <\s>
<s> whatever made you choose caste dot <\s>
<s> you know it's awfully difficult <\s>
<s> because it's the only play that's not too advanced <\s>
<s> the girls all go into the billiard room lady cheshire <\s>
<s> with a grimace i rather think sir william and he are in committee of supply mem sahib <\s>
<s> she looks uneasily at the dining room then follows the girls out <\s>
<s> in the tone of one resuming an argument there can't be two opinions about it ronny <\s>
<s> young dunning's refusal is simply indefensible <\s>
<s> i don't agree a bit john <\s>
<s> of course if you won't listen <\s>
<s> clipping a cigar draw it mild my dear chap <\s>
<s> we've had the whole thing over twice at least <\s>
<s> my point is this keith <\s>
<s> regarding latter quizzically with his halfclosed eyes i know i know but the point is how far your point is simply professional <\s>
<s> if a man wrongs a woman he ought to right her again <\s>
<s> there's no answer to that <\s>
<s> hang it john one can't argue this out with a parson <\s>
<s> who has entered from the dining room pull devil pull baker <\s>
<s> to play the game is the religion even of the army <\s>
<s> exactly but what is the game <\s>
<s> what else can it be in this case <\s>
<s> you're too puritanical young john <\s>
<s> you can't help it line of country laid down for you <\s>
<s> with concentration look here <\s>
<s> imitating the action of a man pulling at a horse's head come hup i say you hugly beast <\s>
<s> to latter you're not going to draw me old chap <\s>
<s> you don't see where you'd land us all <\s>
<s> he smokes calmly latter <\s>
<s> how do you imagine vice takes its rise <\s>
<s> from precisely this sort of thing of young dunning's <\s>
<s> from human nature i should have thought john <\s>
<s> i admit that i don't like a fellow's leavin a girl in the lurch but i don't see the use in drawin hard and fast rules <\s>
<s> you only have to break em <\s>
<s> sir william and you would just tie dunning and the girl up together willy nilly to save appearances and ten to one but there'll be the deuce to pay in a year's time <\s>
<s> you can take a horse to the water you can't make him drink <\s>
<s> i entirely and absolutely disagree with you <\s>

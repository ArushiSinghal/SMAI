<s> rather left of centre at a card table lord st erth an old john bull sits facing the audience to his right is general canynge to his left augustus borring an essential clubman about thirty five years old with a very slight and rather becoming stammer or click in his speech <\s>
<s> the fourth bridge player charles winsor stands with his back to the fire <\s>
<s> you do hold cards borring <\s>
<s> who has lost not a patch on the old whist this game <\s>
<s> don't know why i play it never did <\s>
<s> st erth shall we raise the flag for whist again <\s>
<s> you can't go back on pace <\s>
<s> no getting a man to walk when he knows he can fly <\s>
<s> the young men won't look at it <\s>
<s> better develop it so that t two can sit out general <\s>
<s> we ought to have stuck to the old game <\s>
<s> wish i'd gone to newmarket canynge in spite of the weather <\s>
<s> looking at his watch let's hear what's won the cambridgeshire <\s>
<s> ring won't you winsor <\s>
<s> winsor rings st erth <\s>
<s> by the way canynge young de levis was blackballed <\s>
<s> i looked in on my way down <\s>
<s> canynge sits very still and winsor utters a disturbed sound <\s>
<s> but of c course he was general <\s>
<s> what did you expect <\s>
<s> what won the cambridgeshire <\s>
<s> sherbet second barbizon third <\s>
<s> nine to one the winner <\s>
<s> and de levis sold her <\s>
<s> but he got a good p price i suppose <\s>
<s> the other three look at him <\s>
<s> many a slip between price and pocket young man <\s>
<s> i say is that the yarn that's going round about his having had a lot of m money stolen in a country house <\s>
<s> he'll be pretty s sick <\s>
<s> you and i borring <\s>
<s> he sits down in canynge's chair and the general takes his place by the fire <\s>
<s> won't dancy be mad <\s>
<s> he gave that filly away to save her keep <\s>
<s> he was rather pleased to find somebody who'd take her <\s>
<s> bentman must have won a p pot <\s>
<s> she was at thirty threes a fortnight ago <\s>
<s> all the money goes to fellows who don't know a horse from a haystack <\s>
<s> profoundly and care less <\s>
<s> we want men racing to whom a horse means something <\s>
<s> i thought the horse m meant the same to everyone general chance to get the b better of one's neighbour <\s>
<s> with feeling the horse is a noble animal sir as you'd know if you'd owed your life to them as often as i have <\s>
<s> they always try to take mine general <\s>
<s> i shall never belong to the noble f fellowship of the horse <\s>
<s> as borring begins to deal the door is opened and major colford appears a lean and moustached cavalryman <\s>
<s> something in the tone of his voice brings them all to a standstill <\s>
<s> i want your advice <\s>
<s> young de levis in there he points to the billiard room from which he has just come has started a blasphemous story canynge <\s>
<s> mr borring d'you mind colford <\s>
<s> it makes no odds general <\s>
<s> four of us in there heard him <\s>
<s> he's saying it was ronald dancy robbed him down at winsor's <\s>
<s> the fellow's mad over losing the price of that filly now she's won the cambridgeshire <\s>
<s> dancy's in the club <\s>
<s> if he hadn't been i'd have taken it on myself to wring the bounder's neck <\s>
<s> winsor and borring have risen <\s>
<s> st erth alone remains seated <\s>
<s> after consulting st erth with a look ask de levis to be good enough to come in here <\s>
<s> borring you might see that dancy doesn't leave the club <\s>
<s> we shall want him <\s>
<s> don't say anything to him and use your tact to keep people off <\s>
<s> borring goes out followed by colford <\s>
<s> result of hearing he was black balled pretty slippy <\s>
<s> st erth i told you there was good reason when i asked you to back young de levis <\s>
<s> winsor and i knew of this insinuation i wanted to keep his tongue quiet <\s>
<s> it's just wild assertion to have it bandied about was unfair to dancy <\s>
<s> the duel used to keep people's tongues in order <\s>

<s> i could tell you of at least a dozen men i know who've been through this same business and got off scot free and now because bill's going to play the game it'll smash him up <\s>
<s> why didn't he play the game at the beginning <\s>
<s> i can't stand your sort john <\s>
<s> when a thing like this happens all you can do is to cry out why didn't he <\s>
<s> what's to be done that's the point <\s>
<s> of course he'll have to <\s>
<s> what do you mean by that <\s>
<s> you feel in your bones that a marriage'll be hopeless just as i do knowing bill and the girl and everything <\s>
<s> the whole thing is is most unfortunate <\s>
<s> i should think it was <\s>
<s> as he speaks christine and keith come in from the billiard room <\s>
<s> he is still in splashed hunting clothes and looks exceptionally weathered thin lipped reticent <\s>
<s> he lights a cigarette and sinks into an armchair <\s>
<s> behind them dot and joan have come stealing in <\s>
<s> this waiting for father to be told is awful <\s>
<s> to keith where did you leave the old man <\s>
<s> he'll be home in ten minutes <\s>
<s> they all stir as if at fresh consciousness of discomfiture <\s>
<s> she walked into gracely and sent herself a telegram <\s>
<s> and we shall say good bye as if nothing had happened <\s>
<s> it's up to you ronny <\s>
<s> keith looking at joan slowly emits smoke and latter passing his arm through joan's draws her away with him into the billiard room <\s>
<s> i'm not a squeamy squirrel <\s>
<s> anybody seen the girl since <\s>
<s> she's just sitting there <\s>
<s> in a hard voice as we're all doing <\s>
<s> she's so soft that's what's so horrible <\s>
<s> if one could only feel <\s>
<s> she's got to face the music like the rest of us <\s>
<s> the whole thing's like a concertina and some one jigging it <\s>
<s> they all turn as the door opens and a footman enters with a tray of whiskey gin lemons and soda water <\s>
<s> in dead silence the footman puts the tray down <\s>
<s> forcing his voice did you get a run ronny <\s>
<s> as keith nods what point <\s>
<s> will you take tea sir <\s>
<s> in dead silence again the footman goes out and they all look after him <\s>
<s> below his breath good gad <\s>
<s> that's a squeeze of it <\s>
<s> what's our line of country to be <\s>
<s> all depends on father <\s>
<s> sir william's between the devil and the deep sea as it strikes me <\s>
<s> he'll simply forbid it utterly of course <\s>
<s> man who reads family prayers and lessons on sunday forbids son to christine ronny <\s>
<s> i'm not saying bill ought to marry her <\s>
<s> she's got to stand the racket <\s>

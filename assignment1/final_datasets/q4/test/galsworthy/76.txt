<s> well de levis i'm afraid that's all we can do for the present <\s>

<s> de levis turns round from the window so that he and dancy are staring at each other <\s>
<s> did you hear anything that throws light dancy <\s>
<s> as it was your filly originally we thought perhaps you might <\s>
<s> didn't hear of the sale on the course at all <\s>

<s> nobody could have taken this money who did not know you had it <\s>
<s> how do you know that he didn't <\s>
<s> do you know that he did <\s>
<s> i haven't the least doubt of it <\s>
<s> this is very ugly de levis <\s>
<s> i must tell winsor <\s>
<s> angrily tell the whole blooming lot <\s>
<s> you think i've no feelers but i've felt the atmosphere here i can tell you general <\s>
<s> if i were in dancy's shoes and he in mine your tone to me would be very different <\s>
<s> suavely frigid i'm not aware of using any tone as you call it <\s>
<s> but this is a private house mr de levis and something is due to our host and to the esprit de corps that exists among gentlemen <\s>
<s> since when is a thief a gentleman <\s>
<s> thick as thieves a good motto isn't it <\s>
<s> he goes to the door but stops before opening it now look here <\s>
<s> i have some knowledge of the world <\s>
<s> once an accusation like this passes beyond these walls no one can foresee the consequences <\s>
<s> captain dancy is a gallant fellow with a fine record as a soldier and only just married <\s>
<s> if he's as innocent as christ mud will stick to him unless the real thief is found <\s>
<s> in the old days of swords either you or he would not have gone out of this room alive <\s>

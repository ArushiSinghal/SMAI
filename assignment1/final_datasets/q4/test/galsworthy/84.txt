<s> what on earth has the war to do with it <\s>
<s> the things he tells me ma'am is too wonderful for words <\s>
<s> he's ad to do with prisoners and generals every sort of orror <\s>
<s> the war destroyed all our ideals and probably created the baby <\s>

<s> i didn't mean anything of that sort <\s>
<s> but they do break out so <\s>
<s> he's the worst of all <\s>
<s> his poetry is nothing but one long explosion <\s>
<s> coming from the window i say we ought to have faith and jump <\s>

<s> my old colonel bending over me and giving me a squeeze of lemon <\s>
<s> if you knew my colonel you'd still believe in things <\s>
<s> there is something you know behind all this evil <\s>
<s> after all you can only die once and if it's for your country all the better <\s>
<s> her face in the moonlight with intent eyes touched up with black has a most strange other world look girl <\s>
<s> no i believe in nothing not even in my country <\s>
<s> my heart is dead <\s>
<s> yes you think so but it isn't you know or you wouldn't have been crying when i met you <\s>
<s> if it were not dead do you think i could live my life walking the streets every night pretending to like strange men never hearing a kind word never talking for fear i will be known for a german <\s>
<s> soon i shall take to drinking then i shall be kaput veree quick <\s>
<s> you see i am practical i see things clear <\s>
<s> to night i am a little emotional the moon is funny you know <\s>
<s> but i live for myself only now <\s>
<s> i don't care for anything or anybody <\s>
<s> all the same just now you were pitying your folk at home and prisoners and that <\s>
<s> yees because they suffer <\s>
<s> those who suffer are like me i pity myself that's all i am different from your english women <\s>
<s> i see what i am doing i do not let my mind become a turnip just because i am no longer moral <\s>
<s> nor your heart either for all you say <\s>
<s> ni ice boy you are veree obstinate <\s>
<s> but all that about love is umbog <\s>
<s> we love ourselves noting more <\s>
<s> at that intense soft bitterness in her voice he gets up feeling stifled and stands at the window <\s>
<s> a newspaper boy some way off is calling his wares <\s>
<s> the girl's fingers slip between his own and stay unmoving <\s>
<s> he looks round into her face <\s>
<s> in spite of make up it has a queer unholy touching beauty <\s>
<s> with an outburst no we don't only love ourselves there is more <\s>
<s> i can't explain but there's something great there's kindness and and the shouting of newspaper boys grows louder and their cries passionately vehement clash into each other and obscure each word <\s>
<s> his head goes up to listen her hand tightens within his arm she too is listening <\s>
<s> the cries come nearer hoarser more shrill and clamorous the empty moonlight outside seems suddenly crowded with figures footsteps voices and a fierce distant cheering <\s>
<s> eavy defeat of the uns <\s>
<s> it speeds by intoxicating filling him with a fearful joy he leans far out waving his cap and cheering like a madman the night seems to flutter and vibrate and answer <\s>
<s> he turns to rush down into the street strikes against something soft and recoils <\s>
<s> the girl stands with hands clenched and face convulsed panting <\s>
<s> all confused with the desire to do something he stoops to kiss her hand <\s>
<s> she snatches away her fingers sweeps up the notes he has put down and holds them out to him girl <\s>
<s> take them i will not haf your english money take them <\s>
<s> suddenly she tears them across twice thrice lets the bits <\s>
<s> flutter to the floor and turns her back on him <\s>
<s> he stands looking at her leaning against the plush covered table her head down a dark figure in a dark room with the moonlight sharpening her outline <\s>
<s> hardly a moment he stays then makes for the door <\s>
<s> when he is gone she still stands there her chin on her breast with the sound in her ears of cheering of hurrying feet and voices crying eavy defeat <\s>
<s> stands in the centre of a pattern made by the fragments of the torn up notes staring out unto the moonlight seeing not this hated room and the hated square outside but a german orchard and herself a little girl plucking apples a big dog beside her and a hundred other pictures such as the drowning see <\s>
<s> then she sinks down on the floor lays her forehead on the dusty carpet and presses her body to it <\s>
<s> mechanically she sweeps together the scattered fragments of notes assembling them with the dust into a little pile as of fallen leaves and dabbling in it with her fingers while the tears run down her cheeks <\s>
<s> then suddenly in the moonlight she sits up and begins to sing with all her might die wacht am rhein <\s>
<s> and outside men pass singing rule britannia curtain the sun a scene characters the girl <\s>
<s> the sun a girl sits crouched over her knees on a stile close to a river <\s>
<s> a man with a silver badge stands beside her clutching the worn top plank <\s>
<s> the girl's level brows are drawn together her eyes see her memories <\s>
<s> the man's eyes see the girl he has a dark twisted face <\s>
<s> the bright sun shines the quiet river flows the cuckoo is calling the mayflower is in bloom along the hedge that ends in the stile on the towing path <\s>
<s> god knows what e'll say jim <\s>
<s> e's come too late that's all <\s>
<s> he couldn't come before <\s>
<s> e was fond o me <\s>
<s> and aren't i fond of you <\s>
<s> i ought to a waited jim with im in the fightin <\s>
<s> passionately and what about me <\s>

<s> one man's luck's another's poison <\s>
<s> i ought to a waited <\s>
<s> i never thought he'd come back from the fightin <\s>
<s> grimly maybe e'd better not ave <\s>
<s> looking back along the tow path what'll he be like i wonder <\s>
<s> gripping her shoulder daisy don't you never go back on me or i should kill you and im too <\s>
<s> the girl looks at him shivers and puts her lips to his the girl <\s>
<s> will you run for it <\s>
<s> e'd never find us <\s>
<s> the girl shakes her head the man dully what's the good o stayin <\s>
<s> i'd rather have it off me mind with him home <\s>

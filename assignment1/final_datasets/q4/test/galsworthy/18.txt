<s> how sweet of mother <\s>
<s> in a quick toneless voice the others are for miss lanfarne <\s>
<s> my lady thought white would suit her better <\s>
<s> they suit you in that black dress <\s>
<s> freda lowers the roses quickly what do you think of joan's engagement <\s>
<s> it's very nice for her <\s>
<s> i say freda have they been going hard at rehearsals <\s>
<s> miss dot gets very cross stage managing <\s>
<s> i do hate learning a part <\s>
<s> thanks awfully for unpacking <\s>
<s> in the same quick dull voice the under keeper dunning won't marry rose taylor after all <\s>
<s> but i say that's serious <\s>
<s> i thought there was she was i mean freda <\s>
<s> he's taken up with another girl they say <\s>
<s> pinning the roses d'you know if mr <\s>
<s> with a swift upward look yes by the six forty <\s>
<s> ronald keith comes slowly down a weathered firm lipped man in evening dress with eyelids half drawn over his keen eyes and the air of a horseman <\s>
<s> i say freda your father missed a wigging this morning when they drew blank at warnham's spinney <\s>
<s> where's that litter of little foxes <\s>
<s> smiling faintly i expect father knows captain keith <\s>
<s> you bet he does <\s>
<s> studdenham'd never shoot a fox ronny <\s>
<s> he's been here since the flood <\s>
<s> there's more ways of killing a cat eh freda <\s>
<s> moving with her husband towards the drawing room young dunning won't marry that girl ronny <\s>
<s> wouldn't be in his shoes then <\s>
<s> sir william'll never keep a servant who's made a scandal in the village old girl <\s>
<s> as they disappear from the hall john latter in a clergyman's evening dress comes sedately downstairs a tall rather pale young man with something in him as it were both of heaven and a drawing room <\s>
<s> he passes freda with a formal little nod <\s>
<s> harold a fresh cheeked cheery looking youth comes down three steps at a time <\s>
<s> patience on the monument <\s>
<s> let's have a sniff <\s>
<s> bill come down yet <\s>
<s> harold crosses the hall whistling and follows latter into the drawing room <\s>
<s> there is the sound of a scuffle above and a voice crying shut up dot <\s>
<s> and joan comes down screwing her head back <\s>
<s> she is pretty and small with large clinging eyes <\s>
<s> am i all right behind freda <\s>
<s> dot's face like a full moon appears over the upper banisters <\s>
<s> she too comes running down a frank figure with the face of a rebel <\s>
<s> flying towards the drawing roam is overtaken at the door oh <\s>
<s> as they disappear into the drawing room mabel lanfarne a tall girl with a rather charming irish face comes slowly down <\s>
<s> and at sight of her freda's whole figure becomes set and meaningfull <\s>
<s> for you miss lanfarne from my lady <\s>
<s> in whose speech is a touch of wilful irishry how sweet <\s>
<s> fastening the roses and how are you freda <\s>
<s> very well thank you <\s>
<s> hope he's going to let me come out with the guns again <\s>
<s> stolidly he'll be delighted i'm sure <\s>
<s> i haven't forgotten his face last time <\s>
<s> you stood with mr <\s>
<s> he's better to stand with than mr <\s>
<s> harold or captain keith <\s>
<s> he didn't touch a feather that day <\s>
<s> people don't when they're anxious to do their best <\s>
<s> and mabel lanfarne giving freda a rather inquisitive stare moves on to the drawing room <\s>
<s> left alone without the roses freda still lingers <\s>
<s> at the slamming of a door above and hasty footsteps she shrinks back against the stairs <\s>
<s> bill runs down and comes on her suddenly <\s>

<s> twenty two with a short upper lip a straight nose dark hair and glowing eyes <\s>
<s> she wears bright colours and has a slow musical voice with a slight lisp <\s>
<s> how are you mother dear <\s>

<s> do you want a lot of reasons or the real one <\s>
<s> mother dear will you go into the other room with guy <\s>
<s> she points to the door right <\s>
<s> because i would rather she didn't hear the reason <\s>
<s> to athene sotto voce he's not safe <\s>
<s> guy follows mrs builder and after hesitation at the door they go out into the bedroom <\s>
<s> i ought to have put quiet pressure <\s>
<s> what are you smiling at <\s>
<s> mrs builder shrugs her shoulders <\s>
<s> he examines the brand on the box strong very and not good <\s>
<s> he opens the door kitchen <\s>
<s> he shuts it crosses and opens the door right bedroom <\s>
<s> to his disappearing form do you think you ought john <\s>
<s> he has disappeared and she ends with an expressive movement of her hands a long sigh and a closing of her eyes <\s>
<s> builder's peremptory voice is heard julia <\s>
<s> she follows into the bedroom <\s>
<s> the maid annie puts her head out of the kitchen door she comes out a step as if to fly then at builder's voice shrinks back into the kitchen <\s>
<s> builder reappearing with a razor strop in one hand and a shaving brush in the other is followed by mrs builder <\s>
<s> getting between him and the kitchen door it's not dignified <\s>
<s> i don't care a damn <\s>
<s> athene has the tiny beginning of a moustache you know <\s>
<s> i shall stay and clear this up if i have to wait a week <\s>
<s> men who let their daughters <\s>
<s> this age is the limit <\s>
<s> he makes a vicious movement with the strop as though laying it across someone's back mrs builder <\s>
<s> she would never stand that <\s>
<s> even wives object nowadays <\s>
<s> grimly the war's upset everything <\s>
<s> women are utterly out of hand <\s>
<s> why the deuce doesn't she come <\s>
<s> suppose you leave me here to see her <\s>
<s> ominously this is my job <\s>
<s> i think it's more mine <\s>
<s> don't stand there opposing everything i say <\s>
<s> i'll go and have another look he is going towards the bedroom when the sound of a latchkey in the outer door arrests him <\s>
<s> he puts the strop and brush behind his back and adds in a low voice here she is <\s>
<s> mrs builder has approached him and they have both turned towards the opening door <\s>
<s> guy herringhame comes in <\s>
<s> they are a little out of his line of sight and he has shut the door before he sees them <\s>
<s> when he does his mouth falls open and his hand on to the knob of the door <\s>
<s> he is a comely young man in harris tweeds <\s>
<s> moreover he is smoking <\s>
<s> he would speak if he could but his surprise is too excessive <\s>
<s> recovering a little i was about to say the same to you sir <\s>
<s> very red from repression these rooms are not yours are they <\s>
<s> may i ask if you know whose they are <\s>
<s> will you kindly tell me why your sister signs her drawings by the name of my daughter athene builder and has a photograph of my wife hanging there <\s>
<s> the young man looks at mrs builder and winces but recovers himself <\s>
<s> boldly as a matter of fact this is my sister's studio she's in france and has a friend staying here <\s>
<s> and you have a key <\s>
<s> does your sister shave <\s>
<s> i i don't think so <\s>
<s> then perhaps you'll tell me what these mean <\s>
<s> he takes out the strop and shaving stick <\s>
<s> addressing mrs builder need we go into this in your presence ma'am <\s>
<s> it seems rather delicate <\s>
<s> what explanation have you got <\s>
<s> well you see builder <\s>
<s> no lies out with it <\s>
<s> with decision i prefer to say nothing <\s>
<s> do you live here <\s>
<s> guy makes no sign <\s>
<s> to guy i think you had better go <\s>
<s> julia will you leave me to manage this <\s>
<s> to guy when do you expect my daughter in <\s>
<s> quietly are you married to her <\s>
<s> that is no o not altogether i mean <\s>
<s> folding his arms i'm not going to say another word <\s>
<s> don't put your oar in <\s>
<s> i've had wonderful patience so far <\s>
<s> he puts his boot through a drawing art <\s>
<s> this is what comes of it <\s>
<s> are you an artist <\s>
<s> no a flying man <\s>
<s> the truth is builder <\s>
<s> i don't want to hear you speak the truth <\s>
<s> i'll wait for my daughter <\s>
<s> if you do i hope you'll be so very good as to be gentle <\s>
<s> if you get angry i might too and that would be awfully ugly <\s>
<s> i quite understand that sir <\s>
<s> but as a man of the world i hope you'll take a pull before she comes if you mean to stay <\s>
<s> if we mean to stay <\s>
<s> will you have a cigarette <\s>
<s> i i can't express guy <\s>
<s> soothingly don't try sir <\s>
<s> he jerks up his chin listening i think that's her <\s>

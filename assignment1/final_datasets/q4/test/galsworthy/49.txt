<s> the dad and i'll be with you all in spirit <\s>
<s> they do not dare to kiss and hubert goes out very stiff and straight in the doorway passing steel of whom he takes no notice <\s>
<s> steel hesitates and would go away <\s>
<s> the deputation from toulmin ought to be here mrs <\s>
<s> having made a little ball of newspaper slyly mr <\s>
<s> she throws and steel catches it in silence katherine <\s>
<s> go upstairs won't you darling <\s>

<s> olive goes reluctantly out on to the terrace steel <\s>
<s> awful news this morning of that pass <\s>
<s> and have you seen these <\s>
<s> reading from the newspaper we will have no truck with the jargon of the degenerate who vilifies his country at such a moment <\s>
<s> the member for toulmin has earned for himself the contempt of all virile patriots <\s>
<s> he takes up a second journal there is a certain type of public man who even at his own expense cannot resist the itch to advertise himself <\s>
<s> we would at moments of national crisis muzzle such persons as we muzzle dogs that we suspect of incipient rabies <\s>
<s> they're in full cry after him <\s>
<s> i mind much more all the creatures who are always flinging mud at the country making him their hero suddenly <\s>
<s> you know what's in his mind <\s>
<s> we must get him to give up that idea of lecturing everywhere against the war mrs <\s>
<s> more we simply must <\s>
<s> listening the deputation's come <\s>
<s> go and fetch him mr <\s>
<s> he'll be in his room at the house <\s>
<s> steel goes out and katherine stands at bay <\s>
<s> in a moment he opens the door again to usher in the deputation then retires <\s>
<s> the four gentlemen have entered as if conscious of grave issues <\s>
<s> the first and most picturesque is james home a thin tall grey bearded man with plentiful hair contradictious eyebrows and the half shy half bold manners alternately rude and over polite of one not accustomed to society yet secretly much taken with himself <\s>
<s> he is dressed in rough tweeds with a red silk tie slung through a ring and is closely followed by mark wace a waxy round faced man of middle age with sleek dark hair traces of whisker and a smooth way of continually rubbing his hands together as if selling something to an esteemed customer <\s>
<s> he is rather stout wears dark clothes with a large gold chain <\s>
<s> following him comes charles shelder a lawyer of fifty with a bald egg shaped head and gold pince nez <\s>
<s> he has little side whiskers a leathery yellowish skin a rather kind but watchful and dubious face and when he speaks seems to have a plum in his mouth which arises from the preponderance of his shaven upper lip <\s>
<s> last of the deputation comes william banning an energetic looking square shouldered self made country man between fifty and sixty with grey moustaches ruddy face and lively brown eyes katherine <\s>
<s> how do you do mr <\s>
<s> bowing rather extravagantly over her hand as if to show his independence of women's influence mrs <\s>
<s> we hardly expected this is an honour <\s>

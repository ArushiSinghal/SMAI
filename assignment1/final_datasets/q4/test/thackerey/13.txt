<s> at her accustomed hour and instead of the rude gigot a l'eau which was ordinarily served at her too simple table i sent her up a little potage a la reine a la reine blanche i called it as white as her own tint and confectioned with the most fragrant cream and almonds <\s>
<s> i then offered up at her shrine a filet de merlan a l'gnes and a delicate plat which i designated as eperlan a la sainte therese and of which my charming miss partook with pleasure <\s>
<s> i followed this by two little entrees of sweetbread and chicken and the only brown thing which i permitted myself in the entertainment was a little roast of lamb which i lay in a meadow of spinaches surrounded with croustillons representing sheep and ornamented with daisies and other savage flowers <\s>
<s> after this came my second service a pudding a la reine elizabeth who madame fribsbi knows was a maiden princess ); a dish of opal coloured plover's eggs which i called nid de tourtereaux a la roucoule placing in the midst of them two of those tender volatiles billing each other and confectioned with butter a basket containing little gateaux of apricots which i know all young ladies adore and a jelly of marasquin bland insinuating intoxicating as the glance of beauty <\s>
<s> this i designated ambroisie de calypso a la souveraine de mon coeur <\s>
<s> and when the ice was brought in an ice of plombiere and cherries how do you think i had shaped them madame fribsbi <\s>
<s> in the form of two hearts united with an arrow on which i had laid before it entered a bridal veil in cut paper surmounted by a wreath of virginal orange flowers <\s>
<s> i stood at the door to watch the effect of this entry <\s>
<s> it was but one cry of admiration <\s>
<s> the three young ladies filled their glasses with the sparkling ay and carried me in a toast <\s>
<s> i heard it i heard miss speak of me i heard her say tell monsieur mirobolant that we thank him we admire him we love him <\s>
<s> my feet almost failed me as she spoke <\s>
<s> since that can i have any reason to doubt that the young artist has made some progress in the heart of the english miss <\s>
<s> i am modest but my glass informs me that i am not ill looking <\s>
<s> other victories have convinced me of the fact <\s>
<s> the blond misses of albion see nothing in the dull inhabitants of their brumous isle which can compare with the ardour and vivacity of the children of the south <\s>
<s> we bring our sunshine with us we are frenchmen and accustomed to conquer <\s>
<s> were it not for this affair of the heart and my determination to marry an anglaise do you think i would stop in this island which is not altogether ungrateful since i have found here a tender mother in the respectable madame fribsbi in this island in this family <\s>
<s> my genius would use itself in the company of these rustics the poesy of my art cannot be understood by these carnivorous insularies <\s>
<s> no the men are odious but the women the women <\s>
<s> i own dear fribsbi are seducing <\s>
<s> i have vowed to marry one and as i cannot go into your markets and purchase according to the custom of the country i am resolved to adopt another custom and fly with one to gretna grin <\s>
<s> the blonde miss will go <\s>
<s> her eyes have told me so <\s>
<s> the white dove wants but the signal to fly <\s>
<s> have you any correspondence with her <\s>
<s> asked fribsby in amazement and not knowing whether the young lady or the lover might be labouring under a romantic delusion <\s>
<s> i correspond with her by means of my art <\s>
<s> she partakes of dishes which i make expressly for her <\s>
<s> i insinuate to her thus a thousand hints which as she is perfectly spiritual she receives <\s>
<s> but i want other intelligences near her <\s>
<s> there is pincott her maid said madame fribsby who by aptitude or education seemed to have some knowledge of affairs of the heart but the great artist's brow darkened at this suggestion <\s>
<s> madame he said there are points upon which a gallant man ought to silence himself though if he break the secret he may do so with the least impropriety to his best friend his adopted mother <\s>
<s> know then that there is a cause why miss pincott should be hostile to me a cause not uncommon with your sex jealousy <\s>
<s> ah no said the artist with a deep bass voice and a tragic accent worthy of the port st martin and his favourite melodrames not perfidious but fatal <\s>
<s> yes i am a fatal man madame fribsbi <\s>
<s> to inspire hopeless passion is my destiny <\s>
<s> i cannot help it that women love me <\s>
<s> is it my fault that that young woman deperishes and languishes to the view of the eye consumed by a flame which i cannot return <\s>
<s> there are others in this family who are similarly unhappy <\s>
<s> the governess of the young milor has encountered me in my walks and looked at me in a way which can bear but one interpretation <\s>
<s> and milady herself who is of mature age but who has oriental blood has once or twice addressed compliments to the lonely artist which can admit of no mistake <\s>
<s> i avoid the household i seek solitude i undergo my destiny <\s>
<s> i can marry but one and am resolved it shall be to a lady of your nation <\s>
<s> and if her fortune is sufficient i think miss would be the person who would be most suitable <\s>
<s> i wish to ascertain what her means are before i lead her to gretna grin <\s>
<s> whether alcides was as irresistible a conqueror as his namesake or whether he was simply crazy is a point which must be left to the reader's judgment <\s>
<s> but the latter if he had had the benefit of much french acquaintance has perhaps met with men amongst them who fancied themselves almost as invincible and who if you credit them have made equal havoc in the hearts of les anglaises <\s>
<s> contains both love and jealousy our readers have already heard sir francis clavering's candid opinion of the lady who had given him her fortune and restored him to his native country and home and it must be owned that the baronet was not far wrong in his estimate of his wife and that lady clavering was not the wisest or the best educated of women <\s>
<s> she had had a couple of years education in europe in a suburb of london which she persisted in calling ackney to her dying day whence she had been summoned to join her father at calcutta at the age of fifteen <\s>
<s> and it was on her voyage thither on board the ramchunder east indiaman captain bragg in which ship she had two years previously made her journey to europe that she formed the acquaintance of her first husband mr <\s>
<s> amory who was third mate of the vessel in question <\s>
<s> we are not going to enter into the early part of lady clavering's history but captain bragg under whose charge miss snell went out to her father who was one of the captain's consignees and part owner of the ramchunder and many other vessels found reason to put the rebellious rascal of a mate in irons until they reached the cape where the captain left his officer behind and finally delivered his ward to her father at calcutta after a stormy and perilous voyage in which the ramchunder and the cargo and passengers incurred no small danger and damage <\s>
<s> some months afterwards amory made his appearance at calcutta having worked his way out before the mast from the cape married the rich attorney's daughter in spite of that old speculator set up as indigo planter and failed set up as agent and failed again set up as editor of the sunderbund pilot and failed again quarrelling ceaselessly with his father in law and his wife during the progress of all these mercantile transactions and disasters and ending his career finally with a crash which compelled him to leave calcutta and go to new south wales <\s>
<s> it was in the course of these luckless proceedings that mr <\s>
<s> amory probably made the acquaintance of sir jasper rogers the respected judge of the supreme court of calcutta who has been mentioned before and as the truth must out it was by making an improper use of his father in law's name who could write perfectly well and had no need of an amanuensis that fortune finally forsook mr <\s>
<s> amory and caused him to abandon all further struggles with her <\s>
<s> not being in the habit of reading the calcutta law reports very assiduously the european public did not know of these facts as well as people did in bengal and mrs <\s>
<s> amory and her father finding her residence in india not a comfortable one it was agreed that the lady should return to europe whither she came with her little daughter betsy or blanche then four years old <\s>
<s> they were accompanied by betsy's nurse who has been presented to the reader in the last chapter as the confidential maid of lady clavering mrs <\s>
<s> bonner and captain bragg took a house for them in the near neighbourhood of his residence in pocklington street <\s>
<s> it was a very hard bitter summer and the rain it rained every day for some time after mrs <\s>
<s> bragg was very pompous and disagreeable perhaps ashamed perhaps anxious to get rid of the indian lady <\s>
<s> she believed that all the world in london was talking about her husband's disaster and that the king and queen and the court of directors were aware of her unlucky history <\s>
<s> she had a good allowance from her father she had no call to live in england and she determined to go abroad <\s>
<s> away she went then glad to escape the gloomy surveillance of the odious bully captain bragg <\s>
<s> people had no objection to receive her at the continental towns where she stopped and at the various boarding houses where she royally paid her way <\s>
<s> she called hackney ackney to be sure though otherwise she spoke english with a little foreign twang very curious and not unpleasant ); she dressed amazingly she was conspicuous for her love of eating and drinking and prepared curries and pillaws at every boarding house which she frequented but her singularities of language and behaviour only gave a zest to her society and mrs <\s>
<s> amory was deservedly popular <\s>
<s> she was the most good natured jovial and generous of women <\s>
<s> she was up to any party of pleasure by whomsoever proposed <\s>
<s> she brought three times more champagne and fowl and ham to the picnics than anyone else <\s>
<s> she took endless boxes for the play and tickets for the masked balls and gave them away to everybody <\s>
<s> she paid the boarding house people months beforehand she helped poor shabby mustachiod bucks and dowagers whose remittances had not arrived with constant supplies from her purse and in this way she tramped through europe and appeared at brussels at paris at milan at naples at rome as her fancy led her <\s>
<s> news of amory's death reached her at the latter place where captain clavering was then staying unable to pay his hotel bill as indeed was his friend the chevalier strong and the good natured widow married the descendant of the ancient house of clavering professing indeed no particular grief for the scapegrace of a husband whom she had lost <\s>
<s> we have brought her thus up to the present time when she was mistress of clavering park in the midst of which mr <\s>
<s> pinckney the celebrated painter pourtrayed her with her little boy by her side <\s>
<s> missy followed her mamma in most of her peregrinations and so learned a deal of life <\s>
<s> she had a governess for some time and after her mother's second marriage the benefit of madame de caramel's select pension in the champs elysees <\s>
<s> when the claverings came to england she of course came with them <\s>
<s> it was only within a few years after the death of her grandfather and the birth of her little brother that she began to understand that her position in life was altered and that miss amory nobody's daughter was a very small personage in a house compared with master francis clavering heir to an ancient baronetcy and a noble estate <\s>
<s> but for little frank she would have been an heiress in spite of her father and though she knew and cared not much about money of which she never had any stint and though she was a romantic little muse as we have seen yet she could not reasonably be grateful to the persons who had so contributed to change her condition nor indeed did she understand what the latter really was until she had made some further progress and acquired more accurate knowledge in the world <\s>
<s> but this was clear that her stepfather was dull and weak that mamma dropped her h's and was not refined in manners or appearance and that little frank was a spoiled quarrelsome urchin always having his way always treading upon her feet always upsetting his dinner on her dresses and keeping her out of her inheritance <\s>
<s> none of these as she felt could comprehend her and her solitary heart naturally pined for other attachments and she sought around her where to bestow the precious boon of her unoccupied affection <\s>
<s> this dear girl then from want of sympathy or other cause made herself so disagreeable at home and frightened her mother and bored her stepfather so much that they were quite as anxious as she could be that she should settle for herself in life and hence sir francis clavering's desire expressed to his friend in the last chapter that mrs <\s>

<s> as he emptied his bottle the colonel described at full length all his plans and prospects to pen who was interested in listening to his story and the confessions of his daring and lawless good humour <\s>
<s> i met that queer fellow altamont the other day pen said to his uncle a day or two afterwards <\s>
<s> there's lord westport's son said the major <\s>
<s> no no the fellow who came tipsy into clavering's dining room one day when we were there said the nephew laughing he said he did not like the name of pendennis though he did me the honour to think that i was a good fellow <\s>
<s> i don't know any man of the name of altamont i give you my honour said the impenetrable major and as for your acquaintance i think the less you have to do with him the better arthur <\s>
<s> he is going to quit the country and make his fortune by a gambling system <\s>
<s> he and my amiable college acquaintance bloundell are partners and the colonel takes out strong with him as aide de camp <\s>
<s> what is it that binds the chevalier and clavering i wonder <\s>
<s> i should think mind you pen i should think but of course i have only the idea that there has been something in clavering's previous life which gives these fellows and some others a certain power over him and if there should be no such a secret which affair of ours my boy dammy i say it ought to be a lesson to a man to keep himself straight in life and not to give any man a chance over him <\s>
<s> why i think you have some means of persuasion over clavering uncle or why should he give me that seat in parlament <\s>
<s> clavering thinks he ain't fit for parliament the major answered <\s>
<s> no more he is <\s>
<s> what's to prevent him from putting you or anybody else into his place if he likes <\s>
<s> do you think that vernment or the opposition would make any bones about accepting the seat if he offered it to them <\s>
<s> why should you be more squeamish than the first men and the most honourable men and men of the highest birth and position in the country begad <\s>
<s> the major had an answer of this kind to most of pen's objections and pen accepted his uncle's replies not so much because he believed them but because he wished to believe them <\s>
<s> we do a thing which of us has not not because everybody does it but because we like it and our acquiescence alas <\s>
<s> proves not that everybody is right but that we and the rest of the world are poor creatures alike <\s>
<s> at his next visit to tunbridge mr <\s>
<s> pen did not forget to amuse miss blanche with the history which he had learned at richmond of the chevalier's imprisonment and of altamont's gallant rescue <\s>
<s> and after he had told his tale in his usual satirical way he mentioned with praise and emotion little fanny's generous behaviour to the chevalier and altamont's enthusiasm in her behalf <\s>
<s> arthur was in correspondence with a young lady whose initials were b <\s>
<s> to these pretty little compositions mr <\s>
<s> pen replied in his best and gallantest manner with jokes with news of the town with points of wit nay with pretty little verses very likely in reply to the versicles of the muse of mes larmes <\s>
<s> blanche we know rhymes with branch and stanch and launch and no doubt a gentleman of pen's ingenuity would not forgo these advantages of position and would ring the pretty little changes upon these pleasing notes <\s>
<s> indeed we believe that those love verses of mr <\s>
<s> pen's which had such a pleasing success in the roseleaves that charming annual edited by lady violet lebas and illustrated by portraits of the female nobility by the famous artist pinkney were composed at this period of our hero's life and were first addressed to blanche per post before they figured in print cornets as it were to pinkney's pictorial garland <\s>
<s> verses are all very well the elder pendennis said who found pen scratching down one of these artless effusions at the club as he was waiting for his dinner and letter writing if mamma allows it and between such old country friends of course there may be a correspondence and that sort of thing but mind pen and don't commit yourself my boy <\s>
<s> for who knows what the doose may happen <\s>
<s> the best way is to make your letters safe <\s>
<s> i never wrote a letter in all my life that would commit me and demmy sir i have had some experience of women <\s>
<s> and the worthy gentleman growing more garrulous and confidential with his nephew as he grew older told many affecting instances of the evil results consequent upon this want of caution to many persons in society how from using too ardent expressions in some poetical notes to the widow naylor young spoony had subjected himself to a visit of remonstrance from the widow's brother colonel flint and thus had been forced into a marriage with a woman old enough to be his mother how when louisa salter had at length succeeded in securing young sir john bird hopwood of the blues produced some letters which miss s <\s>
<s> had written to him and caused a withdrawal on bird's part who afterwards was united to miss stickney of lyme regis etc <\s>
<s> the major if he had not reading had plenty of observation and could back his wise saws with a multitude of modern instances which he had acquired in a long and careful perusal of the great book of the world <\s>
<s> pen laughed at the examples and blushing a little at his uncle's remonstrances said that he would bear them in mind and be cautious <\s>
<s> he blushed perhaps because he had borne them in mind because he was cautious because in his letters to miss blanche he had from instinct or honesty perhaps refrained from any avowals which might compromise him <\s>
<s> don't you remember the lesson i had sir in lady mirabel's miss fotheringay's affair <\s>
<s> i am not to be caught again uncle arthur said with mock frankness and humility <\s>
<s> old pendennis congratulated himself and his nephew heartily on the latter's prudence and progress and was pleased at the position which arthur was taking as a man of the world <\s>
<s> no doubt if warrington had been consulted his opinion would have been different and he would have told pen that the boy's foolish letters were better than the man's adroit compliments and slippery gallantries that to win the woman he loves only a knave or a coward advances under cover with subterfuges and a retreat secured behind him but pen spoke not on this matter to mr <\s>
<s> warrington knowing pretty well that he was guilty and what his friend's verdict would be <\s>
<s> colonel altamont had not been for many weeks absent on his foreign tour sir francis clavering having retired meanwhile into the country pursuant to his agreement with major pendennis when the ills of fate began to fall rather suddenly and heavily upon the sole remaining partner of the little firm of shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> when strong at parting with altamont refused the loan proffered by the latter in the fulness of his purse and the generosity of his heart he made such a sacrifice to conscience and delicacy as caused him many an after twinge and pang he and felt it was not very many hours in his life he had experienced the feeling that in this juncture of his affairs he had been too delicate and too scrupulous <\s>
<s> why should a fellow in want refuse a kind offer kindly made <\s>
<s> why should a thirsty man decline a pitcher of water from a friendly hand because it was a little soiled <\s>
<s> strong's conscience smote him for refusing what the other had fairly come by and generously proffered and he thought ruefully now it was too late that altamont's cash would have been as well in his pocket as in that of the gambling house proprietor at baden or ems with whom his excellency would infallibly leave his derby winnings <\s>
<s> it was whispered among the tradesmen bill discounters and others who had commercial dealings with captain strong that he and the baronet had parted company and that the captain's paper was henceforth of no value <\s>
<s> the tradesmen who had put a wonderful confidence in him hitherto for who could resist strong's jolly face and frank and honest demeanour now began to pour in their bills with a cowardly mistrust and unanimity <\s>
<s> the knocks at the shepherd's inn chambers door were constant and tailors bootmakers pastrycooks who had furnished dinners in their own persons or by the boys their representatives held levees on strong's stairs <\s>
<s> to these were added one or two persons of a less clamorous but far more sly and dangerous sort the young clerks of lawyers namely who lurked about the inn or concerted with mr <\s>
<s> campion's young man in the chambers hard by having in their dismal pocketbooks copies of writs to be served on edward strong requiring him to appear on an early day next term before our sovereign lady the queen and answer to etc <\s>
<s> from this invasion of creditors poor strong who had not a guinea in his pocket had of course no refuge but that of the englishman's castle into which he retired shutting the outer and inner door upon the enemy and not quitting his stronghold until after nightfall <\s>
<s> against this outer barrier the foe used to come and knock and curse in vain whilst the chevalier peeped at them from behind the little curtain which he had put over the orifice of his letter box and had the dismal satisfaction of seeing the faces of furious clerk and fiery dun as they dashed up against the door and retreated from it <\s>
<s> but as they could not be always at his gate or sleep on his staircase the enemies of the chevalier sometimes left him free <\s>
<s> strong when so pressed by his commercial antagonists was not quite alone in his defence against them but had secured for himself an ally or two <\s>
<s> his friends were instructed to communicate with him by a system of private signals and they thus kept the garrison from starving by bringing in necessary supplies and kept up strong's heart and prevented him from surrendering by visiting him and cheering him in his retreat <\s>
<s> two of ned's most faithful allies were huxter and miss fanny bolton when hostile visitors were prowling about the inn fanny's little sisters were taught a particular cry or jodel which they innocently whooped in the court when fanny and huxter came up to visit strong they archly sang this same note at his door when that barrier was straightway opened the honest garrison came out smiling the provisions and the pot of porter were brought in and in the society of his faithful friends the beleaguered one passed a comfortable night <\s>
<s> there are some men who could not live under this excitement but strong was a brave man as we have said who had seen service and never lost heart in peril <\s>
<s> but besides allies our general had secured for himself under difficulties that still more necessary aid a retreat <\s>
<s> it has been mentioned in a former part of this history how messrs <\s>
<s> costigan and bows lived in the house next door to captain strong and that the window of one of their rooms was not very far off the kitchen window which was situated in the upper story of strong's chambers <\s>
<s> a leaden water pipe and gutter served for the two and strong looking out from his kitchen one day saw that he could spring with great ease up to the sill of his neighbour's window and clamber up the pipe which communicated from one to the other <\s>
<s> he had laughingly shown this refuge to his chum altamont and they had agreed that it would be as well not to mention the circumstance to captain costigan whose duns were numerous and who would be constantly flying down the pipe into their apartments if this way of escape were shown to him <\s>
<s> but now that the evil days were come strong made use of the passage and one afternoon burst in upon bows and costigan with his jolly face and explained that the enemy was in waiting on his staircase and that he had taken this means of giving them the slip <\s>
<s> marks's aides de camp were in waiting in the passage of no <\s>
<s> 3 strong walked down the steps of no <\s>
<s> 4 dined at the albion went to the play and returned home at midnight to the astonishment of mrs <\s>
<s> bolton and fanny who had not seen him quit his chambers and could not conceive how he could have passed the line of sentries <\s>
<s> strong bore this siege for some weeks with admirable spirit and resolution and as only such an old and brave soldier would for the pains and privations which he had to endure were enough to depress any man of ordinary courage and what vexed and riled him to use his own expression was the infernal indifference and cowardly ingratitude of clavering to whom he wrote letter after letter which the baronet never acknowledged by a single word or by the smallest remittance though a five pound note as strong said at that time would have been a fortune to him <\s>
<s> but better days were in store for the chevalier and in the midst of his despondency and perplexities there came to him a most welcome aid <\s>
<s> yes if it hadn't been for this good fellow here said strong for a good fellow you are altamont my boy and hang me if i don't stand by you as long as i live i think pendennis it would have been all up with ned strong <\s>
<s> i was the fifth week of my being kept a prisoner for i couldn't be always risking my neck across that water pipe and taking my walks abroad through poor old cos's window and my spirit was quite broken sir dammy quite beat and i was thinking of putting an end to myself and should have done it in another week when who should drop down from heaven but altamont <\s>

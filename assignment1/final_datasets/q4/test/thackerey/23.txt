<s> he entertained him affably with news of the day or rather of ten days previous for pen in his quality of journalist remembered to have seen some of the captain's opinions in the sporting and theatrical newspaper which was costigan's oracle <\s>

<s> he struggled up the highest stairs of the panorama but when he had arrived panting at the height of the eminence care had come up with him and was bearing him company <\s>
<s> he went to the club and wrote a long letter home exceedingly witty and sarcastic and in which if he did not say a single word about vauxhall and fanny bolton it was because he thought that subject however interesting to himself would not be very interesting to his mother and laura <\s>
<s> nor could the novels or the library table fix his attention nor the grave and respectable jawkins the only man in town who wished to engage him in conversation nor any of the amusements which he tried after flying from jawkins <\s>

<s> arthur pendennis was of a romantic and literary turn by no means addicted to the legal pursuits common in the neighbourhood of the place we may presume that he was cherishing some such poetical reflections as these when upon the evening after the events recorded in the last chapter the young gentleman chose the temple gardens as a place for exercise and meditation <\s>
<s> on the sunday evening the temple is commonly calm <\s>
<s> the chambers are for the most part vacant the great lawyers are giving grand dinner parties at their houses in the belgravian or tyburnian districts the agreeable young barristers are absent attending those parties and paying their respects to mr <\s>

<s> whither does fancy lead us <\s>
<s> it is vacation time and with the exception of pendennis nobody is in chambers at all <\s>
<s> perhaps it was solitude then which drove pen into the garden for although he had never before passed the gate and had looked rather carelessly at the pretty flower beds and the groups of pleased citizens sauntering over the trim lawn and the broad gravel walks by the river on this evening it happened as we have said that the young gentleman who had dined alone at a tavern in the neighbourhood of the temple took a fancy as he was returning home to his chambers to take a little walk in the gardens and enjoy the fresh evening air and the sight of the shining thames <\s>
<s> after walking for a brief space and looking at the many peaceful and happy groups round about him he grew tired of the exercise and betook himself to one of the summer houses which flank either end of the main walk and there modestly seated himself <\s>

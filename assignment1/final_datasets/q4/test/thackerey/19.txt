<s> foker for the absence of more lively qualities which most of his own relatives did not enjoy and which he found in mesdemoiselles the ladies of the theatre <\s>
<s> his mother though good and tender did not amuse her boy his cousins the daughters of his maternal uncle the respectable earl of rosherville wearied him beyond measure <\s>
<s> one was blue and a geologist one was a horsewoman and smoked cigars one was exceedingly low church and had the most heterodox views on religious matters at least so the other said who was herself of the very highest church faction and made the cupboard in her room into an oratory and fasted on every friday in the year <\s>
<s> their paternal house of drummington foker could very seldom be got to visit <\s>
<s> he swore he had rather go on the treadmill than stay there <\s>
<s> he was not much beloved by the inhabitants <\s>
<s> lord erith lord rosherville's heir considered his cousin a low person of deplorably vulgar habits and manners while foker and with equal reason voted erith a prig and a dullard the nightcap of the house of commons the speaker's opprobrium the dreariest of philanthropic spouters <\s>
<s> nor could george robert earl of gravesend and rosherville ever forget that on one evening when he condescended to play at billiards with his nephew that young gentleman poked his lordship in the side with his cue and said well old cock i've seen many a bad stroke in my life but i never saw such a bad one as that there <\s>
<s> he played the game out with angelic sweetness of temper for harry was his guest as well as his nephew but he was nearly having a fit in the night and he kept to his own rooms until young harry quitted drummington on his return to oxbridge where the interesting youth was finishing his education at the time when the occurrence took place <\s>
<s> it was an awful blow to the venerable earl the circumstance was never alluded to in the family he shunned foker whenever he came to see them in london or in the country and could hardly be brought to gasp out a how d'ye do <\s>
<s> to the young blasphemer <\s>
<s> but he would not break his sister agnes's heart by banishing harry from the family altogether nor indeed could he afford to break with mr <\s>
<s> foker senior between whom and his lordship there had been many private transactions producing an exchange of bank cheques from mr <\s>
<s> foker and autographs from the earl himself with the letters i o u written over his illustrious signature <\s>
<s> besides the four daughters of lord gravesend whose various qualities have been enumerated in the former paragraph his lordship was blessed with a fifth girl the lady ana milton who from her earliest years and nursery had been destined to a peculiar position in life <\s>
<s> it was ordained between her parents and her aunt that when mr harry foker attained a proper age lady ann should become his wife <\s>
<s> the idea had been familiar to her mind when she yet wore pinafores and when harry the dirtiest of little boys used to come back with black eyes from school to drummington or to his father's house of logwood where lady ann lived much with her aunt <\s>
<s> both of the young people coincided with the arrangement proposed by the elders without any protests or difficulty <\s>
<s> it no more entered lady ann's mind to question the order of her father than it would have entered esther's to dispute the commands of ahasuerus <\s>
<s> the heir apparent of the house of foker was also obedient for when the old gentleman said harry your uncle and i have agreed that when you're of a proper age you'll marry lady ann <\s>
<s> she won't have any money but she's good blood and a good one to look at and i shall make you comfortable <\s>
<s> if you refuse you'll have your mother's jointure and two hundred a year during my life harry who knew that his sire though a man of few words was yet implicitly to be trusted acquiesced at once in the parental decree and said well sir if ann's agreeable i say ditto <\s>
<s> she's not a bad looking girl <\s>
<s> and she has the best blood in england sir <\s>
<s> your mother's blood your own blood sir said the brewer <\s>
<s> there's nothing like it sir <\s>
<s> well sir as you like it harry replied <\s>
<s> when you want me please ring the bell <\s>
<s> only there's no hurry and i hope you'll give us a long day <\s>
<s> i should like to have my fling out before i marry <\s>
<s> fling away harry answered the benevolent father <\s>
<s> nobody prevents you do they <\s>
<s> and so very little more was said upon this subject and mr <\s>
<s> harry pursued those amusements in life which suited him best and hung up a little picture of his cousin in his sitting room amidst the french prints the favourite actresses and dancers the racing and coaching works of art which suited his taste and formed his gallery <\s>
<s> it was an insignificant little picture representing a simple round face with ringlets and it made as it must be confessed a very poor figure by the side of mademoiselle petitot dancing over a rainbow or mademoiselle redowa grinning in red boots and a lancer's cap <\s>
<s> being engaged and disposed of lady ann milton did not go out so much in the world as her sisters and often stayed at home in london at the parental house in gaunt square when her mamma with the other ladies went abroad <\s>
<s> they talked and they danced with one man after another and the men came and went and the stories about them were various <\s>
<s> but there was only this one story about ann she was engaged to harry foker she never was to think about anybody else <\s>
<s> it was not a very amusing story <\s>
<s> well the instant foker awoke on the day after lady clavering's dinner there was blanche's image glaring upon him with its clear grey eyes and winning smile <\s>
<s> there was her tune ringing in his ears yet round about the spot ofttimes i hover ofttimes i hover which poor foker began piteously to hum as he sat up in his bed under the crimson silken coverlet <\s>
<s> opposite him was a french print of a turkish lady and her greek lover surprised by a venerable ottoman the lady's husband on the other wall was a french print of a gentleman and lady riding and kissing each other at full gallop all round the chaste bedroom were more french prints either portraits of gauzy nymphs of the opera or lovely illustrations of the novels or mayhap an english chef d'oeuvre or two in which miss calverley of t <\s>
<s> would be represented in tight pantaloons in her favourite page part or miss rougemont as venus their value enhanced by the signatures of these ladies maria calverley or frederica rougemont inscribed underneath the prints in an exquisite facsimile <\s>
<s> such were the pictures in which honest harry delighted <\s>
<s> he was no worse than many of his neighbours he was an idle jovial kindly fast man about town and if his rooms were rather profusely decorated with works of french art so that simple lady agnes his mamma on entering the apartments where her darling sate enveloped in fragrant clouds of latakia was often bewildered by the novelties which she beheld there why it must be remembered that he was richer than most young men and could better afford to gratify his taste <\s>
<s> a letter from miss calverley written in a very degage style of spelling and handwriting scrawling freely over the filagree paper and commencing by calling mr <\s>
<s> harry her dear hokey pokey fokey lay on his bed table by his side amidst keys sovereigns cigar cases and a bit of verbena which miss amory had given him and reminding him of the arrival of the day when he was to stand that dinner at the elefant and castle at richmond which he had promised a card for a private box at miss rougemont's approaching benefit a bundle of tickets for ben budgeon's night the north lancashire pippin at martin faunce's the three cornered hat in st <\s>
<s> martin's lane where conkey sam dick the nailor and deadman the worcestershire nobber would put on the gloves and the lovers of the good old british sport were invited to attend' these and sundry other memoirs of mr <\s>
<s> foker's pursuits and pleasure lay on the table by his side when he woke <\s>
<s> how faint all these pleasures seemed now <\s>
<s> what did he care for conkey sam or the worcestershire nobber <\s>
<s> what for the french prints ogling him from all sides of the room those regular stunning slap up out and outers <\s>
<s> and calverley spelling bad and calling him hokey fokey confound her impudence <\s>
<s> the idea of being engaged to a dinner at the elephant and castle at richmond with that old woman who was seven and thirty years old if she was a day filled his mind with dreary disgust now instead of that pleasure which he had only yesterday expected to find from the entertainment <\s>

<s> pen was nevertheless induced to take a brief visit to london in company with his friend mr <\s>
<s> they put up at a hotel in covent garden where bloundell had a tick as he called it and took the pleasures of the town very freely after the wont of young university men <\s>
<s> bloundell still belonged to a military club whither he took pen to dine once or twice the young men would drive thither in a cab trembling lest they should meet major pendennis on his beat in pall mall and here pen was introduced to a number of gallant young fellows with spurs and mustachios with whom he drank pale ale of mornings and beat the town of a night <\s>
<s> here he saw a deal of life indeed nor in his career about the theatres and singing houses which these roaring young blades frequented was he very likely to meet his guardian <\s>
<s> one night nevertheless they were very near to each other a plank only separating pen who was in the boxes of the museum theatre from the major who was in lord steyne's box along with that venerated nobleman <\s>
<s> the fotheringay was in the pride of her glory <\s>
<s> shad made a hit that is she had drawn very good houses for nearly a year had starred the provinces with great eclat had come back to shine in london with somewhat diminished lustre and now was acting with ever increasing attraction etc triumph of the good old british drama as the play bills avowed to houses in which there was plenty of room for anybody who wanted to see her <\s>
<s> it was not the first time pen had seen her since that memorable day when the two had parted in chatteris <\s>
<s> in the previous year when the town was making much of her and the press lauded her beauty pen had found a pretext for coming to london in term time and had rushed off to the theatre to see his old flame <\s>
<s> he recollected it rather than renewed it <\s>
<s> he remembered how ardently he used to be on the look out at chatteris when the speech before ophelia's or mrs <\s>
<s> haller's entrance on the stage was made by the proper actor <\s>
<s> now as the actor spoke he had a sort of feeble thrill as the house began to thunder with applause and ophelia entered with her old bow and sweeping curtsey pen felt a slight shock and blushed very much as he looked at her and could not help thinking that all the house was regarding him <\s>
<s> he hardly heard her for the first part of the play and he thought with such rage of the humiliation to which she had subjected him that he began to fancy he was jealous and in love with her still <\s>
<s> but that illusion did not last very long <\s>
<s> he ran round to the stage door of the theatre to see her if possible but he did not succeed <\s>
<s> she passed indeed under his nose with a female companion but he did not know her nor did she recognise him <\s>
<s> the next night he came in late and stayed very quietly for the afterpiece and on the third and last night of his stay in london why taglioni was going to dance at the opera taglioni <\s>
<s> and there was to be don giovanni which he admired of all things in the world so mr <\s>
<s> pen went to don giovanni and taglioni <\s>
<s> this time the illusion about her was quite gone <\s>
<s> she was not less handsome but she was not the same somehow <\s>
<s> the light was gone out of her eyes which used to flash there or pen's no longer were dazzled by it <\s>
<s> the rich voice spoke as of old yet it did not make pen's bosom thrill as formerly <\s>
<s> he thought he could recognise the brogue underneath the accents seemed to him coarse and false <\s>
<s> it annoyed him to hear the same emphasis on the same words only uttered a little louder worse than this it annoyed him to think that he should ever have mistaken that loud imitation for genius or melted at those mechanical sobs and sighs <\s>
<s> he felt that it was in another life almost that it was another man who had so madly loved her <\s>
<s> he was ashamed and bitterly humiliated and very lonely <\s>
<s> the delusion is better than the truth sometimes and fine dreams than dismal waking <\s>
<s> they went and had an uproarious supper that night and mr <\s>
<s> pen had a fine headache the next morning with which he went back to oxbridge having spent all his ready money <\s>
<s> as all this narrative is taken from pen's own confessions so that the reader may be assured of the truth of every word of it and as pen himself never had any accurate notion of the manner in which he spent his money and plunged himself in much deeper pecuniary difficulties during his luckless residence at oxbridge university it is of course impossible for me to give any accurate account of his involvements beyond that general notion of his way of life which has been sketched a few pages back <\s>
<s> he does not speak too hardly of the roguery of the university tradesmen or of those in london whom he honoured with his patronage at the outset of his career <\s>
<s> even finch the money lender to whom bloundell introduced him and with whom he had various transactions in which the young rascal's signature appeared upon stamped paper treated him according to pen's own account with forbearance and never mulcted him of more than a hundred per cent <\s>
<s> the old college cook his fervent admirer made him a private bill offered to send him in dinners up to the very last and never would have pressed his account to his dying day <\s>
<s> there was that kindness and frankness about arthur pendennis which won most people who came in contact with him and which if it rendered him an easy prey to rogues got him perhaps more goodwill than he merited from many honest men <\s>
<s> it was impossible to resist his good nature or in his worst moments not to hope for his rescue from utter ruin <\s>
<s> at the time of his full career of university pleasure he would leave the gayest party to go and sit with a sick friend <\s>
<s> he never knew the difference between small and great in the treatment of his acquaintances however much the unlucky lad's tastes which were of the sumptuous order led him to prefer good society he was only too ready to share his guinea with a poor friend and when he got money had an irresistible propensity for paying which he never could conquer through life <\s>
<s> in his third year at college the duns began to gather awfully round about him and there was a levee at his oak which scandalised the tutors and would have scared many a stouter heart <\s>
<s> with some of these he used to battle some he would bully under mr <\s>
<s> bloundell's directions who was a master in this art though he took a degree in no other and some deprecate <\s>
<s> and it is reported of him that little mary frodsham the daughter of a certain poor gilder and frame maker whom mr <\s>
<s> pen had thought fit to employ and who had made a number of beautiful frames for his fine prints coming to pendennis with a piteous tale that her father was ill with ague and that there was an execution in their house pen in an anguish of remorse rushed away pawned his grand watch and every single article of jewellery except two old gold sleeve buttons which had belonged to his father and rushed with the proceeds to frodsham's shop where with tears in his eyes and the deepest repentance and humility he asked the poor tradesman's pardon <\s>
<s> this young gentlemen is not told as an instance of pen's virtue but rather of his weakness <\s>
<s> it would have been much more virtuous to have had no prints at all <\s>
<s> he still stood for the baubles which he sold in order to pay frodsham's bill and his mother had cruelly to pinch herself in order to discharge the jeweller's account so that she was in the end the sufferer by the lad's impertinent fancies and follies <\s>
<s> we are not presenting pen to you as a hero or a model only as a lad who in the midst of a thousand vanities and weaknesses has as yet some generous impulses and is not altogether dishonest <\s>
<s> we have said it was to the scandal of mr <\s>
<s> buck the tutor that pen's extravagances became known from the manner in which he entered college the associates he kept and the introductions of doctor portman and the major buck for a long time thought that his pupil was a man of large property and wondered rather that he only wore a plain gown <\s>
<s> once on going up to london to the levee with an address from his majesty's loyal university of oxbridge buck had seen major pendennis at st <\s>
<s> james's in conversation with two knights of the garter in the carriage of one of whom the dazzled tutor saw the major whisked away after the levee <\s>
<s> he asked pen to wine the instant he came back let him off from chapels and lectures more than ever and felt perfectly sure that he was a young gentleman of large estate <\s>
<s> thus he was thunderstruck when he heard the truth and received a dismal confession from pen <\s>
<s> his university debts were large and the tutor had nothing to do and of course pen did not acquaint him with his london debts <\s>
<s> what man ever does tell all when pressed by his friends about his liabilities <\s>
<s> the tutor learned enough to know that pen was poor that he had spent a handsome almost a magnificent allowance and had raised around him such a fine crop of debts as it would be very hard work for any man to mow down for there is no plant that grows so rapidly when once it has taken root <\s>
<s> perhaps it was because she was so tender and good that pen was terrified lest his mother should know of his sins <\s>
<s> i can't bear to break it to her he said to the tutor in an agony of grief <\s>
<s> sir i've been a villain to her and he repented and he wished he had the time to come over again and he asked himself why why did his uncle insist upon the necessity of living with great people and in how much did all his grand acquaintance profit him <\s>
<s> they were not shy but pen thought they were and slunk from them during his last terms at college <\s>
<s> he was as gloomy as a death's head at parties which he avoided of his own part or to which his young friends soon ceased to invite him <\s>
<s> everybody knew that pendennis was hard up <\s>
<s> that man bloundell who could pay nobody and who was obliged to go down after three terms was his ruin the men said <\s>
<s> his melancholy figure might be seen shirking about the lonely quadrangles in his battered old cap and torn gown and he who had been the pride of the university but a year before the man whom all the young ones loved to look at was now the object of conversation at freshmen's wine parties and they spoke of him with wonder and awe <\s>
<s> at last came the degree examinations <\s>
<s> many a young man of his year whose hob nailed shoes pen had derided and whose face or coat he had caricatured many a man whom he had treated with scorn in the lecture room or crushed with his eloquence in the debating club many of his own set who had not half his brains but a little regularity and constancy of occupation took high places in the honours or passed with decent credit <\s>
<s> and where in the list was pen the superb pen the wit and dandy pen the poet and orator <\s>
<s> ah where was pen the widow's darling and sole pride <\s>
<s> let us hide our heads and shut up the page <\s>
<s> the lists came out and a dreadful rumour rushed through the university that pendennis of boniface was plucked <\s>
<s> flight after defeat everybody who has the least knowledge of heraldry and the peerage must be aware that the noble family of which as we know helen pendennis was a member bears for a crest a nest full of little pelicans pecking at the ensanguined bosom of a big maternal bird which plentifully supplies the little wretches with the nutriment on which according to the heraldic legend they are supposed to be brought up <\s>
<s> very likely female pelicans like so to bleed under the selfish little beaks of their young ones it is certain that women do <\s>
<s> there must be some sort of pleasure which we men don't understand which accompanies the pain of being scarified and indeed i believe some women would rather actually so suffer than not <\s>
<s> they like sacrificing themselves in behalf of the object which their instinct teaches them to love <\s>
<s> be it for a reckless husband a dissipated son a darling scapegrace of a brother how ready their hearts are to pour out their best treasures for the benefit of the cherished person and what a deal of this sort of enjoyment are we on one side ready to give the soft creatures <\s>
<s> there is scarce a man that reads this but has administered pleasure in this fashion to his womankind and has treated them to the luxury of forgiving him <\s>
<s> they don't mind how they live themselves but when the prodigal comes home they make a rejoicing and kill the fatted calf for him and at the very first hint that the sinner is returning the kind angels prepare their festival and mercy and forgiveness go smiling out to welcome him <\s>
<s> i hope it may be so always for all if we have only justice to look to heaven help us <\s>
<s> during the latter part of pen's residence at the university of oxbridge his uncle's partiality had greatly increased for the lad <\s>
<s> the major was proud of arthur who had high spirits frank manners a good person and high gentleman like bearing <\s>
<s> it pleased the old london bachelor to see pen walking with the young patricians of his university and he who was never known to entertain his friends and whose stinginess had passed into a sort of byword among some wags at the club who envied his many engagements and did not choose to consider his poverty was charmed to give his nephew and the young lords snug little dinners at his lodgings and to regale them with good claret and his very best bons mots and stories some of which would be injured by the repetition for the major's manner of telling them was incomparably neat and careful and others whereof the repetition would do good to nobody <\s>
<s> he paid his court to their parents through the young men and to himself as it were by their company <\s>
<s> he made more than one visit to oxbridge where the young fellows were amused by entertaining the old gentleman and gave parties and breakfasts and fetes partly to joke him and partly to do him honour <\s>
<s> he plied them with his stories <\s>
<s> he made himself juvenile and hilarious in the company of the young lords <\s>
<s> he went to hear pen at a grand debate at the union crowed and cheered and rapped his stick in chorus with the cheers of the men and was astounded at the boy's eloquence and fire <\s>
<s> he thought he had got a young pitt for a nephew <\s>
<s> he had an almost paternal fondness for pen <\s>
<s> he wrote to the lad letters with playful advice and the news of the town <\s>
<s> he bragged about arthur at his clubs and introduced him with pleasure into his conversation saying that egad the young fellows were putting the old ones to the wall that the lads who were coming up young lord plinlimmon a friend of my boy young lord magnus charters a chum of my scapegrace etc would make a greater figure in the world than even their fathers had done before them <\s>
<s> he asked permission to bring arthur to a grand fete at gaunt house saw him with ineffable satisfaction dancing with the sisters of the young noblemen before mentioned and gave himself as much trouble to procure cards of invitation for the lad to some good houses as if he had been a mamma with a daughter to marry and not an old half pay officer in a wig <\s>
<s> and he boasted everywhere of the boy's great talents and remarkable oratorical powers and of the brilliant degree he was going to take <\s>

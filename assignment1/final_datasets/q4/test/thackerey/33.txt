<s> of these matters pen and warrington often spoke in many a solemn and friendly converse in after days and pendennis's mother was worshipped in his memory and canonised there as such a saint ought to be <\s>
<s> lucky he in life who knows a few such women <\s>
<s> a kind provision of heaven it was that sent us such and gave us to admire that touching and wonderful spectacle of innocence and love and beauty <\s>
<s> but as it is certain that if in the course of these sentimental conversations any outer stranger major pendennis for instance had walked into pen's chambers arthur and warrington would have stopped their talk and chosen another subject and discoursed about the opera or the last debate in parliament or miss jones's marriage with captain smith or what not so let us imagine that the public steps in at this juncture and stops the confidential talk between author and reader and begs us to resume our remarks about this world with which both are certainly better acquainted than with that other one into which we have just been peeping <\s>
<s> on coming into his property arthur pendennis at first comported himself with a modesty and equanimity which obtained his friend warrington's praises though arthur's uncle was a little inclined to quarrel with his nephew's meanness of spirit for not assuming greater state and pretensions now that he had entered on the enjoyment of his kingdom <\s>
<s> he would have had arthur installed in handsome quarters and riding on showy park hacks or in well built cabriolets every day <\s>
<s> i am too absent arthur said with a laugh to drive a cab in london the omnibus would cut me in two or i should send my horse's head into the ladies carriage windows and you wouldn't have me driven about by my servant like an apothecary uncle <\s>
<s> no major pendennis would on no account have his nephew appear like an apothecary the august representative of the house of pendennis must not so demean himself <\s>
<s> and when arthur pursuing his banter said and yet i dare say sir my father was proud enough when he first set up his gig the old major hemmed and ha'd and his wrinkled face reddened with a blush as he answered you know what buonaparte said sir il faut laver son linge sale en famille <\s>
<s> there is no need sir for you to brag that your father was a a medical man <\s>
<s> he came of a most ancient but fallen house and was obliged to reconstruct the family fortunes as many a man of good family has done before him <\s>
<s> you are like the fellow in sterne sir the marquis who came to demand his sword again <\s>
<s> your father got back yours for you <\s>
<s> you are a man of landed estate by gad sir and a gentleman never forget you are a gentleman <\s>
<s> then arthur slily turned on his uncle the argument which he had heard the old gentleman often use regarding himself <\s>
<s> in the society which i have the honour of frequenting through your introduction who cares to ask about my paltry means or my humble gentility uncle <\s>
<s> it would be absurd of me to attempt to compete with the great folks and all that they can ask from us is that we should have a decent address and good manners <\s>
<s> but for all that sir i should belong to a better club or two the uncle answered i should give an occasional dinner and select my society well and i should come out of that horrible garret in the temple sir <\s>
<s> and so arthur compromised by descending to the second floor in lamb court warrington still occupying his old quarters and the two friends being determined not to part one from the other <\s>
<s> cultivate kindly reader those friendships of your youth it is only in that generous time that they are formed <\s>
<s> how different the intimacies of after days are and how much weaker the grasp of your own hand after it has been shaken about in twenty years commerce with the world and has squeezed and dropped a thousand equally careless palms <\s>
<s> as you can seldom fashion your tongue to speak a new language after twenty the heart refuses to receive friendship pretty soon it gets too hard to yield to the impression <\s>
<s> so pen had many acquaintances and being of a jovial and easy turn got more daily but no friend like warrington and the two men continued to live almost as much in common as the knights of the temple riding upon one horse for pen's was at warrington's service and having their chambers and their servitor in common <\s>
<s> warrington had made the acquaintance of pen's friends of grosvenor place during their last unlucky season in london and had expressed himself no better satisfied with sir francis and lady clavering and her ladyship's daughter than was the public in general <\s>
<s> the world is right george said about those people <\s>
<s> the young men laugh and talk freely before those ladies and about them <\s>
<s> the girl sees people whom she has no right to know and talks to men with whom no girl should have an intimacy <\s>
<s> did you see those two reprobates leaning over lady clavering's carriage in the park the other day and leering under miss blanche's bonnet <\s>
<s> no good mother would let her daughter know those men or admit them within her doors <\s>
<s> the begum is the most innocent and good natured soul alive interposed pen <\s>
<s> she never heard any harm of captain blackball or read that trial in which charley lovelace figures <\s>
<s> do you suppose that honest ladies read and remember the chronique scandaleuse as well as you you old grumbler <\s>
<s> would you like laura bell to know those fellows <\s>
<s> warrington asked his face turning rather red <\s>
<s> would you let any woman you loved be contaminated by their company <\s>
<s> i have no doubt that the poor begum is ignorant of their histories <\s>
<s> it seems to me she is ignorant of a great number of better things <\s>
<s> it seems to me that your honest begum is not a lady pen <\s>
<s> it is not her fault doubtless that she has not had the education or learned the refinements of a lady <\s>
<s> she is as moral as lady portsea who has all the world at her balls and as refined as mrs <\s>
<s> bull who breaks the king's english and has half a dozen dukes at her table pen answered rather sulkily <\s>
<s> why should you and i be more squeamish than the rest of the world <\s>
<s> why are we to visit the sins of her father on this harmless kind creature <\s>
<s> she never did anything but kindness to you or any mortal soul <\s>
<s> as far as she knows she does her best <\s>
<s> she does not set up to be more than she is <\s>
<s> she gives you the best dinners she can buy and the best company she can get <\s>
<s> she pays the debts of that scamp of a husband of hers <\s>

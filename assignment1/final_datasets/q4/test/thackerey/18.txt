<s> in which the sylph reappears better folks than morgan the valet were not so well instructed as that gentleman regarding the amount of lady clavering's riches and the legend in london upon her ladyship's arrival in the polite metropolis was that her fortune was enormous <\s>
<s> indigo factories opium clippers banks overflowing with rupees diamonds and jewels of native princes and vast sums of interest paid by them for loans contracted by themselves or their predecessors to lady clavering's father were mentioned as sources of her wealth <\s>
<s> her account at her london banker's was positively known and the sum embraced so many cyphers as to create as many o's of admiration in the wondering hearer <\s>
<s> it was a known fact that an envoy from an indian prince a colonel altamont the nawaub of lucknow's prime favourite an extraordinary man who had it was said embraced mahometanism and undergone a thousand wild and perilous adventures was at present in this country trying to negotiate with the begum clavering the sale of the nawaub's celebrated nose ring diamond the light of the dewan <\s>
<s> under the title of the begum lady clavering's fame began to spread in london before she herself descended upon the capital and as it has been the boast of delolme and blackstone and all panegyrists of the british constitution that we admit into our aristocracy merit of every kind and that the lowliest born man if he but deserve it may wear the robes of a peer and sit alongside of a cavendish or a stanley so it ought to be the boast of our good society that haughty though it be naturally jealous of its privileges and careful who shall be admitted into its circle yet if an individual be but rich enough all barriers are instantly removed and he or she is welcomed as from his wealth he merits to be <\s>

<s> as he had superintended the arrangements of the country mansion our friend the chevalier strong gave the benefit of his taste and advice to the fashionable london upholsterers who prepared the town house for the reception of the clavering family <\s>
<s> in the decoration of this elegant abode honest strong's soul rejoiced as much as if he had been himself its proprietor <\s>
<s> he hung and re hung the pictures he studied the positions of sofas he had interviews with wine merchants and purveyors who were to supply the new establishment and at the same time the baronet's factotum and confidential friend took the opportunity of furnishing his own chambers and stocking his snug little cellar his friends complimented him upon the neatness of the former and the select guests who came in to share strong's cutlet new found a bottle of excellent claret to accompany the meal <\s>
<s> the chevalier was now as he said in clover he had a very comfortable set of rooms in shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> he was waited on by a former spanish legionary and comrade of his whom he had left at a breach of a spanish fort and found at a crossing in tottenham court road and whom he had elevated to the rank of body servant to himself and to the chum who at present shared his lodgings <\s>
<s> this was no other than the favourite of the nawaub of lucknow the valiant colonel altamont <\s>
<s> no man was less curious or at any rate more discreet than ned strong and he did not care to inquire into the mysterious connexion which very soon after their first meeting at baymouth was established between sir francis clavering and the envoy of the nawaub <\s>
<s> the latter knew some secret regarding the former which put clavering into his power somehow and strong who knew that his patron's early life had been rather irregular and that his career with his regiment in india had not been brilliant supposed that the colonel who swore he knew clavering well at calcutta had some hold upon sir francis to which the latter was forced to yield <\s>
<s> in truth strong had long understood sir francis clavering's character as that of a man utterly weak in purpose in principle and intellect a moral and physical trifler and poltroon <\s>
<s> with poor clavering his excellency had had one or two interviews after their baymouth meeting the nature of which conversations the baronet did not confide to strong although he sent letters to altamont by that gentleman who was his ambassador in all sorts of affairs <\s>
<s> on one of these occasions the nawaub's envoy must have been in an exceeding ill humour for he crushed clavering's letter in his hand and said with his own particular manner and emphasis a hundred be hanged <\s>
<s> i'll have no more letters nor no more shilly shally <\s>
<s> tell clavering i'll have a thousand or by jove i'll split and burst him all to atoms <\s>
<s> let him give me a thousand and i'll go abroad and i give you my honour as a gentleman i'll not ask him for no more for a year <\s>
<s> give him that message from me strong my boy and tell him if the money ain't here next friday at twelve o'clock as sure as my name's what it is i'll have a paragraph in the newspaper on saturday and next week i'll blow up the whole concern <\s>
<s> strong carried back these words to his principal on whom their effect was such that actually on the day and hour appointed the chevalier made his appearance once more at altamont's hotel at baymouth with the sum of money required <\s>
<s> altamont was a gentleman he said and behaved as such he paid his bill at the inn and the baymouth paper announced his departure on a foreign tour <\s>
<s> strong saw him embark at dover <\s>
<s> it must be forgery at the very least he thought that has put clavering into this fellow's power and the colonel has got the bill <\s>
<s> before the year was out however this happy country saw the colonel once more upon its shores <\s>
<s> a confounded run on the red had finished him he said at baden baden no gentleman could stand against a colour coming up fourteen times <\s>
<s> he had been obliged to draw upon sir francis clavering for means of returning home and clavering though pressed for money for he had election expenses had set up his establishment in the country and was engaged in furnishing his london house yet found means to accept colonel altamont's bill though evidently very much against his will for in strong's hearing sir francis wished to heaven with many curses that the colonel could have been locked up in a debtor's goal in germany for life so that he might never be troubled again <\s>
<s> these sums for the colonel sir francis was obliged to raise without the knowledge of his wife for though perfectly liberal nay sumptuous in her expenditure the good lady had inherited a tolerable aptitude for business along with the large fortune of her father snell and gave to her husband only such a handsome allowance as she thought befitted a gentleman of his rank <\s>
<s> now and again she would give him a present or pay an outstanding gambling debt but she always exacted a pretty accurate account of the moneys so required and respecting the subsidies to the colonel clavering fairly told strong that he couldn't speak to his wife <\s>
<s> strong's business in life was to procure this money and other sums for his patron <\s>
<s> and in the chevalier's apartments in shepherd's inn many negotiations took place between gentlemen of the moneyed world and sir francis clavering and many valuable bank notes and pieces of stamped paper were passed between them <\s>
<s> when a man has been in the habit of getting in debt from his early youth and of exchanging his promises to pay at twelve months against present sums of money it would seem as if no piece of good fortune ever permanently benefited him a little while after the advent of prosperity the money lender is pretty certain to be in the house again and the bills with the old signature in the market <\s>
<s> clavering found it more convenient to see these gentry at strong's lodgings than at his own and such was the chevalier's friendship for the baronet that although he did not possess a shilling of his own his name might be seen as the drawer of almost all the bills of exchange which sir francis clavering accepted <\s>
<s> having drawn clavering's bills he got them discounted in the city <\s>
<s> when they became due he parleyed with the bill holders and gave them instalments of their debt or got time in exchange for fresh acceptances <\s>
<s> regularly or irregularly gentlemen must live somehow and as we read how the other day at comorn the troops forming that garrison were gay and lively acted plays danced at balls and consumed their rations though menaced with an assault from the enemy without the walls and with a gallows if the austrians were successful so there are hundreds of gallant spirits in this town walking about in good spirits dining every day in tolerable gaiety and plenty and going to sleep comfortably with a bailiff always more or less near and a rope of debt round their necks the which trifling inconveniences ned strong the old soldier bore very easily <\s>
<s> but we shall have another opportunity of making acquaintance with these and some other interesting inhabitants of shepherd's inn and in the meanwhile are keeping lady clavering and her friends too long waiting on the door steps of grosvenor place <\s>
<s> first they went into the gorgeous dining room fitted up lady clavering couldn't for goodness gracious tell why in the middle aged style unless said her good natured ladyship laughing because me and clavering are middle aged people and here they were offered the copious remains of the luncheon of which lady clavering and blanche had just partaken <\s>
<s> when nobody was near our little sylphide who scarcely ate at dinner more than the six grains of rice of amina the friend of the ghouls in the arabian nights was most active with her knife and fork and consumed a very substantial portion of mutton cutlets in which piece of hypocrisy it is believed she resembled other young ladies of fashion <\s>
<s> pen and his uncle declined the refection but they admired the dining room with fitting compliments and pronounced it very chaste that being the proper phrase <\s>
<s> there were indeed high backed dutch chairs of the seventeenth century there was a sculptured carved buffet of the sixteenth there was a sideboard robbed out of the carved work of a church in the low countries and a large brass cathedral lamp over the round oak table there were old family portraits from wardour street and tapestry from france bits of armour double handed swords and battle axes made of carton pierre looking glasses statuettes of saints and dresden china nothing in a word could be chaster <\s>
<s> behind the dining room was the library fitted with busts and books all of a size and wonderful easy chairs and solemn bronzes in the severe classic style <\s>
<s> here it was that guarded by double doors sir francis smoked cigars and read bell's life in london and went to sleep after dinner when he was not smoking over the billiard table at his clubs or punting at the gambling houses in saint james's <\s>
<s> but what could equal the chaste splendour of the drawing rooms the carpets were so magnificently fluffy that your foot made no more noise on them than your shadow on their white ground bloomed roses and tulips as big as warming pans about the room were high chairs and low chairs bandy legged chairs chairs so attenuated that it was a wonder any but a sylph could sit upon them marquetterie tables covered with marvellous gimcracks china ornaments of all ages and countries bronzes gilt daggers books of beauty yataghans turkish papooshes and boxes of parisian bonbons <\s>
<s> wherever you sate down there were dresden shepherds and shepherdesses convenient at your elbow there were moreover light blue poodles and ducks and cocks and hens in porcelain there were nymphs by boucher and shepherdesses by greuze very chaste indeed there were muslin curtains and brocade curtains gilt cages with parroquets and love birds two squealing cockatoos each out squealing and out chattering the other a clock singing tunes on a console table and another booming the hours like great tom on the mantelpiece there was in a word everything that comfort could desire and the most elegant taste devise <\s>
<s> a london drawing room fitted up without regard to expense is surely one of the noblest and most curious sights of the present day <\s>
<s> he is now upstairs at bays's playing picquet with count punter he is the second best player in england as well he may be for he plays every day of his life except sundays for sir hugh is an uncommonly religious man from half past three till half past seven when he dresses for dinner <\s>

<s> a confounded run on the red had finished him he said at baden baden no gentleman could stand against a colour coming up fourteen times <\s>
<s> he had been obliged to draw upon sir francis clavering for means of returning home and clavering though pressed for money for he had election expenses had set up his establishment in the country and was engaged in furnishing his london house yet found means to accept colonel altamont's bill though evidently very much against his will for in strong's hearing sir francis wished to heaven with many curses that the colonel could have been locked up in a debtor's goal in germany for life so that he might never be troubled again <\s>
<s> these sums for the colonel sir francis was obliged to raise without the knowledge of his wife for though perfectly liberal nay sumptuous in her expenditure the good lady had inherited a tolerable aptitude for business along with the large fortune of her father snell and gave to her husband only such a handsome allowance as she thought befitted a gentleman of his rank <\s>

<s> and in the chevalier's apartments in shepherd's inn many negotiations took place between gentlemen of the moneyed world and sir francis clavering and many valuable bank notes and pieces of stamped paper were passed between them <\s>
<s> when a man has been in the habit of getting in debt from his early youth and of exchanging his promises to pay at twelve months against present sums of money it would seem as if no piece of good fortune ever permanently benefited him a little while after the advent of prosperity the money lender is pretty certain to be in the house again and the bills with the old signature in the market <\s>
<s> clavering found it more convenient to see these gentry at strong's lodgings than at his own and such was the chevalier's friendship for the baronet that although he did not possess a shilling of his own his name might be seen as the drawer of almost all the bills of exchange which sir francis clavering accepted <\s>
<s> having drawn clavering's bills he got them discounted in the city <\s>

<s> when nobody was near our little sylphide who scarcely ate at dinner more than the six grains of rice of amina the friend of the ghouls in the arabian nights was most active with her knife and fork and consumed a very substantial portion of mutton cutlets in which piece of hypocrisy it is believed she resembled other young ladies of fashion <\s>
<s> pen and his uncle declined the refection but they admired the dining room with fitting compliments and pronounced it very chaste that being the proper phrase <\s>
<s> there were indeed high backed dutch chairs of the seventeenth century there was a sculptured carved buffet of the sixteenth there was a sideboard robbed out of the carved work of a church in the low countries and a large brass cathedral lamp over the round oak table there were old family portraits from wardour street and tapestry from france bits of armour double handed swords and battle axes made of carton pierre looking glasses statuettes of saints and dresden china nothing in a word could be chaster <\s>
<s> behind the dining room was the library fitted with busts and books all of a size and wonderful easy chairs and solemn bronzes in the severe classic style <\s>
<s> here it was that guarded by double doors sir francis smoked cigars and read bell's life in london and went to sleep after dinner when he was not smoking over the billiard table at his clubs or punting at the gambling houses in saint james's <\s>
<s> but what could equal the chaste splendour of the drawing rooms the carpets were so magnificently fluffy that your foot made no more noise on them than your shadow on their white ground bloomed roses and tulips as big as warming pans about the room were high chairs and low chairs bandy legged chairs chairs so attenuated that it was a wonder any but a sylph could sit upon them marquetterie tables covered with marvellous gimcracks china ornaments of all ages and countries bronzes gilt daggers books of beauty yataghans turkish papooshes and boxes of parisian bonbons <\s>
<s> wherever you sate down there were dresden shepherds and shepherdesses convenient at your elbow there were moreover light blue poodles and ducks and cocks and hens in porcelain there were nymphs by boucher and shepherdesses by greuze very chaste indeed there were muslin curtains and brocade curtains gilt cages with parroquets and love birds two squealing cockatoos each out squealing and out chattering the other a clock singing tunes on a console table and another booming the hours like great tom on the mantelpiece there was in a word everything that comfort could desire and the most elegant taste devise <\s>

<s> he used the word pasteboards having heard it from some of the ingenuous youth of the nobility about town and as a modern phrase suited to pen's tender years <\s>
<s> indeed as the two gentlemen reached the door a landau drove up a magnificent yellow carriage lined with brocade or satin of a faint cream colour drawn by wonderful grey horses with flaming ribbons and harness blazing all over with crests no less than three of these heraldic emblems surmounted the coats of arms on the panels and these shields contained a prodigious number of quarterings betokening the antiquity and splendour of the house of clavering and snell <\s>
<s> a coachman in a tight silver wig surmounted the magnificent hammer cloth whereon the same arms were worked in bullion and controlled the prancing greys a young man still but of a solemn countenance with a laced waistcoat and buckles in his shoes little buckles unlike those which john and jeames the footmen wear and which we know are large and spread elegantly over the foot <\s>

<s> these things and men the which to tell of demands time are seen in the glance of a practised eye and in fact the major and pen had scarcely crossed the street when the second battant of the door flew open the horse hair carpet tumbled down the door steps to those of the carriage john was opening it on one side of the emblazoned door and jeames on the other the two ladies attired in the highest style of fashion and accompanied by a third who carried a blenheim spaniel yelping in a light blue ribbon came forth to ascend the carriage <\s>
<s> miss amory was the first to enter which she did with aerial lightness and took the place which she liked best <\s>
<s> lady clavering next followed but her ladyship was more mature of age and heavy of foot and one of those feet attired in a green satin boot with some part of a stocking which was very fine whatever the ankle might be which it encircled might be seen swaying on the carriage step as her ladyship leaned for support on the arm of the unbending jeames by the enraptured observer of female beauty who happened to be passing at the time of this imposing ceremonial <\s>
<s> the pendennises senior and junior beheld those charms as they came up to the door the major looking grave and courtly and pen somewhat abashed at the carriage and its owners for he thought of sundry little passages at clavering which made his heart beat rather quick <\s>
<s> at that moment lady clavering looking round the pair she was on the first carriage step and would have been in the vehicle in another second but she gave a start backwards which caused some of the powder to fly from the hair of ambrosial jeames and crying out lor if it isn't arthur pendennis and the old major <\s>
<s> jumped back to terra firma directly and holding out two fat hands encased in tight orange coloured gloves the good natured woman warmly greeted the major and his nephew <\s>

<s> we've been waitin and waitin for you ever so long <\s>
<s> come in luncheon ain't gone down cried out this hospitable lady squeezing pen's hand in both hers she had dropped the major's after a brief wrench of recognition and blanche casting up her eyes towards the chimneys descended from the carriage presently with a timid blushing appealing look and gave a little hand to major pendennis <\s>
<s> the companion with the spaniel looked about irresolute and doubting whether she should not take fido his airing but she too turned right about face and entered the house after lady clavering her daughter and the two gentlemen <\s>
<s> and the carriage with the prancing greys was left unoccupied save by the coachman in the silver wig <\s>
<s> in which the sylph reappears better folks than morgan the valet were not so well instructed as that gentleman regarding the amount of lady clavering's riches and the legend in london upon her ladyship's arrival in the polite metropolis was that her fortune was enormous <\s>
<s> indigo factories opium clippers banks overflowing with rupees diamonds and jewels of native princes and vast sums of interest paid by them for loans contracted by themselves or their predecessors to lady clavering's father were mentioned as sources of her wealth <\s>
<s> her account at her london banker's was positively known and the sum embraced so many cyphers as to create as many o's of admiration in the wondering hearer <\s>
<s> it was a known fact that an envoy from an indian prince a colonel altamont the nawaub of lucknow's prime favourite an extraordinary man who had it was said embraced mahometanism and undergone a thousand wild and perilous adventures was at present in this country trying to negotiate with the begum clavering the sale of the nawaub's celebrated nose ring diamond the light of the dewan <\s>
<s> under the title of the begum lady clavering's fame began to spread in london before she herself descended upon the capital and as it has been the boast of delolme and blackstone and all panegyrists of the british constitution that we admit into our aristocracy merit of every kind and that the lowliest born man if he but deserve it may wear the robes of a peer and sit alongside of a cavendish or a stanley so it ought to be the boast of our good society that haughty though it be naturally jealous of its privileges and careful who shall be admitted into its circle yet if an individual be but rich enough all barriers are instantly removed and he or she is welcomed as from his wealth he merits to be <\s>
<s> this fact shows our british independence and honest feeling our higher orders are not such mere haughty aristocrats as the ignorant represent them on the contrary if a man have money they will hold out their hands to him eat his dinners dance at his balls marry his daughters or give their own lovely girls to his sons as affably as your commonest roturier would do <\s>
<s> as he had superintended the arrangements of the country mansion our friend the chevalier strong gave the benefit of his taste and advice to the fashionable london upholsterers who prepared the town house for the reception of the clavering family <\s>
<s> in the decoration of this elegant abode honest strong's soul rejoiced as much as if he had been himself its proprietor <\s>
<s> he hung and re hung the pictures he studied the positions of sofas he had interviews with wine merchants and purveyors who were to supply the new establishment and at the same time the baronet's factotum and confidential friend took the opportunity of furnishing his own chambers and stocking his snug little cellar his friends complimented him upon the neatness of the former and the select guests who came in to share strong's cutlet new found a bottle of excellent claret to accompany the meal <\s>
<s> the chevalier was now as he said in clover he had a very comfortable set of rooms in shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> he was waited on by a former spanish legionary and comrade of his whom he had left at a breach of a spanish fort and found at a crossing in tottenham court road and whom he had elevated to the rank of body servant to himself and to the chum who at present shared his lodgings <\s>
<s> this was no other than the favourite of the nawaub of lucknow the valiant colonel altamont <\s>
<s> no man was less curious or at any rate more discreet than ned strong and he did not care to inquire into the mysterious connexion which very soon after their first meeting at baymouth was established between sir francis clavering and the envoy of the nawaub <\s>
<s> the latter knew some secret regarding the former which put clavering into his power somehow and strong who knew that his patron's early life had been rather irregular and that his career with his regiment in india had not been brilliant supposed that the colonel who swore he knew clavering well at calcutta had some hold upon sir francis to which the latter was forced to yield <\s>
<s> in truth strong had long understood sir francis clavering's character as that of a man utterly weak in purpose in principle and intellect a moral and physical trifler and poltroon <\s>
<s> with poor clavering his excellency had had one or two interviews after their baymouth meeting the nature of which conversations the baronet did not confide to strong although he sent letters to altamont by that gentleman who was his ambassador in all sorts of affairs <\s>
<s> on one of these occasions the nawaub's envoy must have been in an exceeding ill humour for he crushed clavering's letter in his hand and said with his own particular manner and emphasis a hundred be hanged <\s>
<s> i'll have no more letters nor no more shilly shally <\s>
<s> tell clavering i'll have a thousand or by jove i'll split and burst him all to atoms <\s>
<s> let him give me a thousand and i'll go abroad and i give you my honour as a gentleman i'll not ask him for no more for a year <\s>
<s> give him that message from me strong my boy and tell him if the money ain't here next friday at twelve o'clock as sure as my name's what it is i'll have a paragraph in the newspaper on saturday and next week i'll blow up the whole concern <\s>
<s> strong carried back these words to his principal on whom their effect was such that actually on the day and hour appointed the chevalier made his appearance once more at altamont's hotel at baymouth with the sum of money required <\s>
<s> altamont was a gentleman he said and behaved as such he paid his bill at the inn and the baymouth paper announced his departure on a foreign tour <\s>

<s> as he had superintended the arrangements of the country mansion our friend the chevalier strong gave the benefit of his taste and advice to the fashionable london upholsterers who prepared the town house for the reception of the clavering family <\s>
<s> in the decoration of this elegant abode honest strong's soul rejoiced as much as if he had been himself its proprietor <\s>
<s> he hung and re hung the pictures he studied the positions of sofas he had interviews with wine merchants and purveyors who were to supply the new establishment and at the same time the baronet's factotum and confidential friend took the opportunity of furnishing his own chambers and stocking his snug little cellar his friends complimented him upon the neatness of the former and the select guests who came in to share strong's cutlet new found a bottle of excellent claret to accompany the meal <\s>
<s> the chevalier was now as he said in clover he had a very comfortable set of rooms in shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> he was waited on by a former spanish legionary and comrade of his whom he had left at a breach of a spanish fort and found at a crossing in tottenham court road and whom he had elevated to the rank of body servant to himself and to the chum who at present shared his lodgings <\s>
<s> this was no other than the favourite of the nawaub of lucknow the valiant colonel altamont <\s>
<s> no man was less curious or at any rate more discreet than ned strong and he did not care to inquire into the mysterious connexion which very soon after their first meeting at baymouth was established between sir francis clavering and the envoy of the nawaub <\s>
<s> the latter knew some secret regarding the former which put clavering into his power somehow and strong who knew that his patron's early life had been rather irregular and that his career with his regiment in india had not been brilliant supposed that the colonel who swore he knew clavering well at calcutta had some hold upon sir francis to which the latter was forced to yield <\s>
<s> in truth strong had long understood sir francis clavering's character as that of a man utterly weak in purpose in principle and intellect a moral and physical trifler and poltroon <\s>
<s> with poor clavering his excellency had had one or two interviews after their baymouth meeting the nature of which conversations the baronet did not confide to strong although he sent letters to altamont by that gentleman who was his ambassador in all sorts of affairs <\s>

<s> strong carried back these words to his principal on whom their effect was such that actually on the day and hour appointed the chevalier made his appearance once more at altamont's hotel at baymouth with the sum of money required <\s>

<s> these sums for the colonel sir francis was obliged to raise without the knowledge of his wife for though perfectly liberal nay sumptuous in her expenditure the good lady had inherited a tolerable aptitude for business along with the large fortune of her father snell and gave to her husband only such a handsome allowance as she thought befitted a gentleman of his rank <\s>
<s> now and again she would give him a present or pay an outstanding gambling debt but she always exacted a pretty accurate account of the moneys so required and respecting the subsidies to the colonel clavering fairly told strong that he couldn't speak to his wife <\s>

<s> and in the chevalier's apartments in shepherd's inn many negotiations took place between gentlemen of the moneyed world and sir francis clavering and many valuable bank notes and pieces of stamped paper were passed between them <\s>
<s> when a man has been in the habit of getting in debt from his early youth and of exchanging his promises to pay at twelve months against present sums of money it would seem as if no piece of good fortune ever permanently benefited him a little while after the advent of prosperity the money lender is pretty certain to be in the house again and the bills with the old signature in the market <\s>
<s> clavering found it more convenient to see these gentry at strong's lodgings than at his own and such was the chevalier's friendship for the baronet that although he did not possess a shilling of his own his name might be seen as the drawer of almost all the bills of exchange which sir francis clavering accepted <\s>

<s> regularly or irregularly gentlemen must live somehow and as we read how the other day at comorn the troops forming that garrison were gay and lively acted plays danced at balls and consumed their rations though menaced with an assault from the enemy without the walls and with a gallows if the austrians were successful so there are hundreds of gallant spirits in this town walking about in good spirits dining every day in tolerable gaiety and plenty and going to sleep comfortably with a bailiff always more or less near and a rope of debt round their necks the which trifling inconveniences ned strong the old soldier bore very easily <\s>
<s> but we shall have another opportunity of making acquaintance with these and some other interesting inhabitants of shepherd's inn and in the meanwhile are keeping lady clavering and her friends too long waiting on the door steps of grosvenor place <\s>

<s> when nobody was near our little sylphide who scarcely ate at dinner more than the six grains of rice of amina the friend of the ghouls in the arabian nights was most active with her knife and fork and consumed a very substantial portion of mutton cutlets in which piece of hypocrisy it is believed she resembled other young ladies of fashion <\s>
<s> pen and his uncle declined the refection but they admired the dining room with fitting compliments and pronounced it very chaste that being the proper phrase <\s>
<s> there were indeed high backed dutch chairs of the seventeenth century there was a sculptured carved buffet of the sixteenth there was a sideboard robbed out of the carved work of a church in the low countries and a large brass cathedral lamp over the round oak table there were old family portraits from wardour street and tapestry from france bits of armour double handed swords and battle axes made of carton pierre looking glasses statuettes of saints and dresden china nothing in a word could be chaster <\s>
<s> behind the dining room was the library fitted with busts and books all of a size and wonderful easy chairs and solemn bronzes in the severe classic style <\s>
<s> here it was that guarded by double doors sir francis smoked cigars and read bell's life in london and went to sleep after dinner when he was not smoking over the billiard table at his clubs or punting at the gambling houses in saint james's <\s>
<s> but what could equal the chaste splendour of the drawing rooms the carpets were so magnificently fluffy that your foot made no more noise on them than your shadow on their white ground bloomed roses and tulips as big as warming pans about the room were high chairs and low chairs bandy legged chairs chairs so attenuated that it was a wonder any but a sylph could sit upon them marquetterie tables covered with marvellous gimcracks china ornaments of all ages and countries bronzes gilt daggers books of beauty yataghans turkish papooshes and boxes of parisian bonbons <\s>
<s> wherever you sate down there were dresden shepherds and shepherdesses convenient at your elbow there were moreover light blue poodles and ducks and cocks and hens in porcelain there were nymphs by boucher and shepherdesses by greuze very chaste indeed there were muslin curtains and brocade curtains gilt cages with parroquets and love birds two squealing cockatoos each out squealing and out chattering the other a clock singing tunes on a console table and another booming the hours like great tom on the mantelpiece there was in a word everything that comfort could desire and the most elegant taste devise <\s>
<s> a london drawing room fitted up without regard to expense is surely one of the noblest and most curious sights of the present day <\s>
<s> he is now upstairs at bays's playing picquet with count punter he is the second best player in england as well he may be for he plays every day of his life except sundays for sir hugh is an uncommonly religious man from half past three till half past seven when he dresses for dinner <\s>

<s> sic vos non vobis as we used to say at grey friars hey <\s>

<s> up to my principles how sir <\s>

<s> you would have cut me in saint james's street sir pen said were your practice not more benevolent than your theory you who live with dukes and magnates of the land and would take no notice of a poor devil like me <\s>
<s> by which speech we may see that mr <\s>
<s> pen was getting on in the world and could flatter as well as laugh in his sleeve <\s>

<s> you have got yourself a little reputation by your literary talents which i am very far from undervaluing though in my time begad poetry and genius and that sort of thing were devilish disreputable <\s>

<s> tempora mutantur sir and by jove i suppose whatever is is right as shakspeare says <\s>
<s> pen did not think fit to tell his uncle who was the author who had made use of that remarkable phrase and here descending from the green park the pair made their way into grosvenor place and to the door of the mansion occupied there by sir francis and lady clavering <\s>
<s> the dining room shutters of this handsome mansion were freshly gilded the knockers shone gorgeous upon the newly painted door the balcony before the drawing room bloomed with a portable garden of the most beautiful plants and with flowers white and pink and scarlet the windows of the upper room the sacred chamber and dressing room of my lady doubtless and even a pretty little casement of the third story which keen sighted mr <\s>
<s> pen presumed to belong to the virgin bedroom of miss blanche amory were similarly adorned with floral ornaments and the whole exterior face of the house presented the most brilliant aspect which fresh new paint shining plate glass newly cleaned bricks and spotless mortar could offer to the beholder <\s>
<s> how strong must have rejoiced in organising all this splendour thought pen <\s>
<s> he recognised the chevalier's genius in the magnificence before him <\s>
<s> lady clavering is going out for her drive the major said <\s>
<s> we shall only have to leave our pasteboards arthur <\s>
<s> he used the word pasteboards having heard it from some of the ingenuous youth of the nobility about town and as a modern phrase suited to pen's tender years <\s>
<s> indeed as the two gentlemen reached the door a landau drove up a magnificent yellow carriage lined with brocade or satin of a faint cream colour drawn by wonderful grey horses with flaming ribbons and harness blazing all over with crests no less than three of these heraldic emblems surmounted the coats of arms on the panels and these shields contained a prodigious number of quarterings betokening the antiquity and splendour of the house of clavering and snell <\s>
<s> a coachman in a tight silver wig surmounted the magnificent hammer cloth whereon the same arms were worked in bullion and controlled the prancing greys a young man still but of a solemn countenance with a laced waistcoat and buckles in his shoes little buckles unlike those which john and jeames the footmen wear and which we know are large and spread elegantly over the foot <\s>
<s> one of the leaves of the hall door was opened and john one of the largest of his race was leaning against the door pillar with his ambrosial hair powdered his legs crossed beautiful silk stockinged in his hand his cane gold headed dolichoskion <\s>
<s> jeames was invisible but near at hand waiting in the hall with the gentleman who does not wear livery and ready to fling down the roll of hair cloth over which her ladyship was to step to her carriage <\s>
<s> these things and men the which to tell of demands time are seen in the glance of a practised eye and in fact the major and pen had scarcely crossed the street when the second battant of the door flew open the horse hair carpet tumbled down the door steps to those of the carriage john was opening it on one side of the emblazoned door and jeames on the other the two ladies attired in the highest style of fashion and accompanied by a third who carried a blenheim spaniel yelping in a light blue ribbon came forth to ascend the carriage <\s>
<s> miss amory was the first to enter which she did with aerial lightness and took the place which she liked best <\s>
<s> lady clavering next followed but her ladyship was more mature of age and heavy of foot and one of those feet attired in a green satin boot with some part of a stocking which was very fine whatever the ankle might be which it encircled might be seen swaying on the carriage step as her ladyship leaned for support on the arm of the unbending jeames by the enraptured observer of female beauty who happened to be passing at the time of this imposing ceremonial <\s>
<s> the pendennises senior and junior beheld those charms as they came up to the door the major looking grave and courtly and pen somewhat abashed at the carriage and its owners for he thought of sundry little passages at clavering which made his heart beat rather quick <\s>
<s> at that moment lady clavering looking round the pair she was on the first carriage step and would have been in the vehicle in another second but she gave a start backwards which caused some of the powder to fly from the hair of ambrosial jeames and crying out lor if it isn't arthur pendennis and the old major <\s>
<s> jumped back to terra firma directly and holding out two fat hands encased in tight orange coloured gloves the good natured woman warmly greeted the major and his nephew <\s>

<s> we shall only have to leave our pasteboards arthur <\s>
<s> he used the word pasteboards having heard it from some of the ingenuous youth of the nobility about town and as a modern phrase suited to pen's tender years <\s>
<s> indeed as the two gentlemen reached the door a landau drove up a magnificent yellow carriage lined with brocade or satin of a faint cream colour drawn by wonderful grey horses with flaming ribbons and harness blazing all over with crests no less than three of these heraldic emblems surmounted the coats of arms on the panels and these shields contained a prodigious number of quarterings betokening the antiquity and splendour of the house of clavering and snell <\s>
<s> a coachman in a tight silver wig surmounted the magnificent hammer cloth whereon the same arms were worked in bullion and controlled the prancing greys a young man still but of a solemn countenance with a laced waistcoat and buckles in his shoes little buckles unlike those which john and jeames the footmen wear and which we know are large and spread elegantly over the foot <\s>
<s> one of the leaves of the hall door was opened and john one of the largest of his race was leaning against the door pillar with his ambrosial hair powdered his legs crossed beautiful silk stockinged in his hand his cane gold headed dolichoskion <\s>
<s> jeames was invisible but near at hand waiting in the hall with the gentleman who does not wear livery and ready to fling down the roll of hair cloth over which her ladyship was to step to her carriage <\s>
<s> these things and men the which to tell of demands time are seen in the glance of a practised eye and in fact the major and pen had scarcely crossed the street when the second battant of the door flew open the horse hair carpet tumbled down the door steps to those of the carriage john was opening it on one side of the emblazoned door and jeames on the other the two ladies attired in the highest style of fashion and accompanied by a third who carried a blenheim spaniel yelping in a light blue ribbon came forth to ascend the carriage <\s>
<s> miss amory was the first to enter which she did with aerial lightness and took the place which she liked best <\s>
<s> lady clavering next followed but her ladyship was more mature of age and heavy of foot and one of those feet attired in a green satin boot with some part of a stocking which was very fine whatever the ankle might be which it encircled might be seen swaying on the carriage step as her ladyship leaned for support on the arm of the unbending jeames by the enraptured observer of female beauty who happened to be passing at the time of this imposing ceremonial <\s>
<s> the pendennises senior and junior beheld those charms as they came up to the door the major looking grave and courtly and pen somewhat abashed at the carriage and its owners for he thought of sundry little passages at clavering which made his heart beat rather quick <\s>
<s> at that moment lady clavering looking round the pair she was on the first carriage step and would have been in the vehicle in another second but she gave a start backwards which caused some of the powder to fly from the hair of ambrosial jeames and crying out lor if it isn't arthur pendennis and the old major <\s>
<s> jumped back to terra firma directly and holding out two fat hands encased in tight orange coloured gloves the good natured woman warmly greeted the major and his nephew <\s>

<s> the companion with the spaniel looked about irresolute and doubting whether she should not take fido his airing but she too turned right about face and entered the house after lady clavering her daughter and the two gentlemen <\s>
<s> and the carriage with the prancing greys was left unoccupied save by the coachman in the silver wig <\s>
<s> in which the sylph reappears better folks than morgan the valet were not so well instructed as that gentleman regarding the amount of lady clavering's riches and the legend in london upon her ladyship's arrival in the polite metropolis was that her fortune was enormous <\s>
<s> indigo factories opium clippers banks overflowing with rupees diamonds and jewels of native princes and vast sums of interest paid by them for loans contracted by themselves or their predecessors to lady clavering's father were mentioned as sources of her wealth <\s>
<s> her account at her london banker's was positively known and the sum embraced so many cyphers as to create as many o's of admiration in the wondering hearer <\s>
<s> it was a known fact that an envoy from an indian prince a colonel altamont the nawaub of lucknow's prime favourite an extraordinary man who had it was said embraced mahometanism and undergone a thousand wild and perilous adventures was at present in this country trying to negotiate with the begum clavering the sale of the nawaub's celebrated nose ring diamond the light of the dewan <\s>
<s> under the title of the begum lady clavering's fame began to spread in london before she herself descended upon the capital and as it has been the boast of delolme and blackstone and all panegyrists of the british constitution that we admit into our aristocracy merit of every kind and that the lowliest born man if he but deserve it may wear the robes of a peer and sit alongside of a cavendish or a stanley so it ought to be the boast of our good society that haughty though it be naturally jealous of its privileges and careful who shall be admitted into its circle yet if an individual be but rich enough all barriers are instantly removed and he or she is welcomed as from his wealth he merits to be <\s>
<s> this fact shows our british independence and honest feeling our higher orders are not such mere haughty aristocrats as the ignorant represent them on the contrary if a man have money they will hold out their hands to him eat his dinners dance at his balls marry his daughters or give their own lovely girls to his sons as affably as your commonest roturier would do <\s>
<s> as he had superintended the arrangements of the country mansion our friend the chevalier strong gave the benefit of his taste and advice to the fashionable london upholsterers who prepared the town house for the reception of the clavering family <\s>
<s> in the decoration of this elegant abode honest strong's soul rejoiced as much as if he had been himself its proprietor <\s>
<s> he hung and re hung the pictures he studied the positions of sofas he had interviews with wine merchants and purveyors who were to supply the new establishment and at the same time the baronet's factotum and confidential friend took the opportunity of furnishing his own chambers and stocking his snug little cellar his friends complimented him upon the neatness of the former and the select guests who came in to share strong's cutlet new found a bottle of excellent claret to accompany the meal <\s>
<s> the chevalier was now as he said in clover he had a very comfortable set of rooms in shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> he was waited on by a former spanish legionary and comrade of his whom he had left at a breach of a spanish fort and found at a crossing in tottenham court road and whom he had elevated to the rank of body servant to himself and to the chum who at present shared his lodgings <\s>
<s> this was no other than the favourite of the nawaub of lucknow the valiant colonel altamont <\s>
<s> no man was less curious or at any rate more discreet than ned strong and he did not care to inquire into the mysterious connexion which very soon after their first meeting at baymouth was established between sir francis clavering and the envoy of the nawaub <\s>
<s> the latter knew some secret regarding the former which put clavering into his power somehow and strong who knew that his patron's early life had been rather irregular and that his career with his regiment in india had not been brilliant supposed that the colonel who swore he knew clavering well at calcutta had some hold upon sir francis to which the latter was forced to yield <\s>
<s> in truth strong had long understood sir francis clavering's character as that of a man utterly weak in purpose in principle and intellect a moral and physical trifler and poltroon <\s>
<s> with poor clavering his excellency had had one or two interviews after their baymouth meeting the nature of which conversations the baronet did not confide to strong although he sent letters to altamont by that gentleman who was his ambassador in all sorts of affairs <\s>
<s> on one of these occasions the nawaub's envoy must have been in an exceeding ill humour for he crushed clavering's letter in his hand and said with his own particular manner and emphasis a hundred be hanged <\s>
<s> i'll have no more letters nor no more shilly shally <\s>
<s> tell clavering i'll have a thousand or by jove i'll split and burst him all to atoms <\s>
<s> let him give me a thousand and i'll go abroad and i give you my honour as a gentleman i'll not ask him for no more for a year <\s>
<s> give him that message from me strong my boy and tell him if the money ain't here next friday at twelve o'clock as sure as my name's what it is i'll have a paragraph in the newspaper on saturday and next week i'll blow up the whole concern <\s>
<s> strong carried back these words to his principal on whom their effect was such that actually on the day and hour appointed the chevalier made his appearance once more at altamont's hotel at baymouth with the sum of money required <\s>
<s> altamont was a gentleman he said and behaved as such he paid his bill at the inn and the baymouth paper announced his departure on a foreign tour <\s>
<s> strong saw him embark at dover <\s>
<s> it must be forgery at the very least he thought that has put clavering into this fellow's power and the colonel has got the bill <\s>
<s> before the year was out however this happy country saw the colonel once more upon its shores <\s>
<s> a confounded run on the red had finished him he said at baden baden no gentleman could stand against a colour coming up fourteen times <\s>
<s> he had been obliged to draw upon sir francis clavering for means of returning home and clavering though pressed for money for he had election expenses had set up his establishment in the country and was engaged in furnishing his london house yet found means to accept colonel altamont's bill though evidently very much against his will for in strong's hearing sir francis wished to heaven with many curses that the colonel could have been locked up in a debtor's goal in germany for life so that he might never be troubled again <\s>
<s> these sums for the colonel sir francis was obliged to raise without the knowledge of his wife for though perfectly liberal nay sumptuous in her expenditure the good lady had inherited a tolerable aptitude for business along with the large fortune of her father snell and gave to her husband only such a handsome allowance as she thought befitted a gentleman of his rank <\s>
<s> now and again she would give him a present or pay an outstanding gambling debt but she always exacted a pretty accurate account of the moneys so required and respecting the subsidies to the colonel clavering fairly told strong that he couldn't speak to his wife <\s>
<s> strong's business in life was to procure this money and other sums for his patron <\s>
<s> and in the chevalier's apartments in shepherd's inn many negotiations took place between gentlemen of the moneyed world and sir francis clavering and many valuable bank notes and pieces of stamped paper were passed between them <\s>
<s> when a man has been in the habit of getting in debt from his early youth and of exchanging his promises to pay at twelve months against present sums of money it would seem as if no piece of good fortune ever permanently benefited him a little while after the advent of prosperity the money lender is pretty certain to be in the house again and the bills with the old signature in the market <\s>
<s> clavering found it more convenient to see these gentry at strong's lodgings than at his own and such was the chevalier's friendship for the baronet that although he did not possess a shilling of his own his name might be seen as the drawer of almost all the bills of exchange which sir francis clavering accepted <\s>
<s> having drawn clavering's bills he got them discounted in the city <\s>
<s> when they became due he parleyed with the bill holders and gave them instalments of their debt or got time in exchange for fresh acceptances <\s>
<s> regularly or irregularly gentlemen must live somehow and as we read how the other day at comorn the troops forming that garrison were gay and lively acted plays danced at balls and consumed their rations though menaced with an assault from the enemy without the walls and with a gallows if the austrians were successful so there are hundreds of gallant spirits in this town walking about in good spirits dining every day in tolerable gaiety and plenty and going to sleep comfortably with a bailiff always more or less near and a rope of debt round their necks the which trifling inconveniences ned strong the old soldier bore very easily <\s>
<s> but we shall have another opportunity of making acquaintance with these and some other interesting inhabitants of shepherd's inn and in the meanwhile are keeping lady clavering and her friends too long waiting on the door steps of grosvenor place <\s>
<s> first they went into the gorgeous dining room fitted up lady clavering couldn't for goodness gracious tell why in the middle aged style unless said her good natured ladyship laughing because me and clavering are middle aged people and here they were offered the copious remains of the luncheon of which lady clavering and blanche had just partaken <\s>
<s> when nobody was near our little sylphide who scarcely ate at dinner more than the six grains of rice of amina the friend of the ghouls in the arabian nights was most active with her knife and fork and consumed a very substantial portion of mutton cutlets in which piece of hypocrisy it is believed she resembled other young ladies of fashion <\s>
<s> pen and his uncle declined the refection but they admired the dining room with fitting compliments and pronounced it very chaste that being the proper phrase <\s>
<s> there were indeed high backed dutch chairs of the seventeenth century there was a sculptured carved buffet of the sixteenth there was a sideboard robbed out of the carved work of a church in the low countries and a large brass cathedral lamp over the round oak table there were old family portraits from wardour street and tapestry from france bits of armour double handed swords and battle axes made of carton pierre looking glasses statuettes of saints and dresden china nothing in a word could be chaster <\s>
<s> behind the dining room was the library fitted with busts and books all of a size and wonderful easy chairs and solemn bronzes in the severe classic style <\s>
<s> here it was that guarded by double doors sir francis smoked cigars and read bell's life in london and went to sleep after dinner when he was not smoking over the billiard table at his clubs or punting at the gambling houses in saint james's <\s>
<s> but what could equal the chaste splendour of the drawing rooms the carpets were so magnificently fluffy that your foot made no more noise on them than your shadow on their white ground bloomed roses and tulips as big as warming pans about the room were high chairs and low chairs bandy legged chairs chairs so attenuated that it was a wonder any but a sylph could sit upon them marquetterie tables covered with marvellous gimcracks china ornaments of all ages and countries bronzes gilt daggers books of beauty yataghans turkish papooshes and boxes of parisian bonbons <\s>
<s> wherever you sate down there were dresden shepherds and shepherdesses convenient at your elbow there were moreover light blue poodles and ducks and cocks and hens in porcelain there were nymphs by boucher and shepherdesses by greuze very chaste indeed there were muslin curtains and brocade curtains gilt cages with parroquets and love birds two squealing cockatoos each out squealing and out chattering the other a clock singing tunes on a console table and another booming the hours like great tom on the mantelpiece there was in a word everything that comfort could desire and the most elegant taste devise <\s>
<s> a london drawing room fitted up without regard to expense is surely one of the noblest and most curious sights of the present day <\s>
<s> he is now upstairs at bays's playing picquet with count punter he is the second best player in england as well he may be for he plays every day of his life except sundays for sir hugh is an uncommonly religious man from half past three till half past seven when he dresses for dinner <\s>
<s> a very pious manner of spending his time pen said laughing and thinking that his uncle was falling into the twaddling state <\s>
<s> gad sir that is not the question <\s>
<s> a man of his estate may employ his time as he chooses <\s>
<s> when you are a baronet a county member with ten thousand acres of the best land in cheshire and such a place as trumpington though he never goes there you may do as you like <\s>
<s> and so that was his brougham sir was it <\s>
<s> the nephew said with almost a sneer <\s>
<s> his brougham o ay yes and that brings me back to my point revenons a nos moutons <\s>
<s> revenons a nous moutons <\s>
<s> well that brougham is mine if i choose between four and seven <\s>

<s> sir hugh is the best natured fellow in the world and if it hadn't been so fine an afternoon as it is you and i would have been in that brougham at this very minute on our way to grosvenor place <\s>
<s> that is the benefit of knowing rich men i dine for nothing sir i go into the country and i'm mounted for nothing <\s>
<s> other fellows keep hounds and gamekeepers for me <\s>
<s> sic vos non vobis as we used to say at grey friars hey <\s>
<s> i'm of the opinion of my old friend leech of the forty fourth and a devilish good shrewd fellow he was as most scotchmen are <\s>

<s> pen and his uncle declined the refection but they admired the dining room with fitting compliments and pronounced it very chaste that being the proper phrase <\s>
<s> there were indeed high backed dutch chairs of the seventeenth century there was a sculptured carved buffet of the sixteenth there was a sideboard robbed out of the carved work of a church in the low countries and a large brass cathedral lamp over the round oak table there were old family portraits from wardour street and tapestry from france bits of armour double handed swords and battle axes made of carton pierre looking glasses statuettes of saints and dresden china nothing in a word could be chaster <\s>
<s> behind the dining room was the library fitted with busts and books all of a size and wonderful easy chairs and solemn bronzes in the severe classic style <\s>

<s> but what could equal the chaste splendour of the drawing rooms the carpets were so magnificently fluffy that your foot made no more noise on them than your shadow on their white ground bloomed roses and tulips as big as warming pans about the room were high chairs and low chairs bandy legged chairs chairs so attenuated that it was a wonder any but a sylph could sit upon them marquetterie tables covered with marvellous gimcracks china ornaments of all ages and countries bronzes gilt daggers books of beauty yataghans turkish papooshes and boxes of parisian bonbons <\s>
<s> wherever you sate down there were dresden shepherds and shepherdesses convenient at your elbow there were moreover light blue poodles and ducks and cocks and hens in porcelain there were nymphs by boucher and shepherdesses by greuze very chaste indeed there were muslin curtains and brocade curtains gilt cages with parroquets and love birds two squealing cockatoos each out squealing and out chattering the other a clock singing tunes on a console table and another booming the hours like great tom on the mantelpiece there was in a word everything that comfort could desire and the most elegant taste devise <\s>

<s> the pendennises senior and junior beheld those charms as they came up to the door the major looking grave and courtly and pen somewhat abashed at the carriage and its owners for he thought of sundry little passages at clavering which made his heart beat rather quick <\s>

<s> jumped back to terra firma directly and holding out two fat hands encased in tight orange coloured gloves the good natured woman warmly greeted the major and his nephew <\s>

<s> the companion with the spaniel looked about irresolute and doubting whether she should not take fido his airing but she too turned right about face and entered the house after lady clavering her daughter and the two gentlemen <\s>
<s> and the carriage with the prancing greys was left unoccupied save by the coachman in the silver wig <\s>
<s> in which the sylph reappears better folks than morgan the valet were not so well instructed as that gentleman regarding the amount of lady clavering's riches and the legend in london upon her ladyship's arrival in the polite metropolis was that her fortune was enormous <\s>
<s> indigo factories opium clippers banks overflowing with rupees diamonds and jewels of native princes and vast sums of interest paid by them for loans contracted by themselves or their predecessors to lady clavering's father were mentioned as sources of her wealth <\s>
<s> her account at her london banker's was positively known and the sum embraced so many cyphers as to create as many o's of admiration in the wondering hearer <\s>
<s> it was a known fact that an envoy from an indian prince a colonel altamont the nawaub of lucknow's prime favourite an extraordinary man who had it was said embraced mahometanism and undergone a thousand wild and perilous adventures was at present in this country trying to negotiate with the begum clavering the sale of the nawaub's celebrated nose ring diamond the light of the dewan <\s>
<s> under the title of the begum lady clavering's fame began to spread in london before she herself descended upon the capital and as it has been the boast of delolme and blackstone and all panegyrists of the british constitution that we admit into our aristocracy merit of every kind and that the lowliest born man if he but deserve it may wear the robes of a peer and sit alongside of a cavendish or a stanley so it ought to be the boast of our good society that haughty though it be naturally jealous of its privileges and careful who shall be admitted into its circle yet if an individual be but rich enough all barriers are instantly removed and he or she is welcomed as from his wealth he merits to be <\s>
<s> this fact shows our british independence and honest feeling our higher orders are not such mere haughty aristocrats as the ignorant represent them on the contrary if a man have money they will hold out their hands to him eat his dinners dance at his balls marry his daughters or give their own lovely girls to his sons as affably as your commonest roturier would do <\s>
<s> as he had superintended the arrangements of the country mansion our friend the chevalier strong gave the benefit of his taste and advice to the fashionable london upholsterers who prepared the town house for the reception of the clavering family <\s>
<s> in the decoration of this elegant abode honest strong's soul rejoiced as much as if he had been himself its proprietor <\s>
<s> he hung and re hung the pictures he studied the positions of sofas he had interviews with wine merchants and purveyors who were to supply the new establishment and at the same time the baronet's factotum and confidential friend took the opportunity of furnishing his own chambers and stocking his snug little cellar his friends complimented him upon the neatness of the former and the select guests who came in to share strong's cutlet new found a bottle of excellent claret to accompany the meal <\s>
<s> the chevalier was now as he said in clover he had a very comfortable set of rooms in shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> he was waited on by a former spanish legionary and comrade of his whom he had left at a breach of a spanish fort and found at a crossing in tottenham court road and whom he had elevated to the rank of body servant to himself and to the chum who at present shared his lodgings <\s>
<s> this was no other than the favourite of the nawaub of lucknow the valiant colonel altamont <\s>
<s> no man was less curious or at any rate more discreet than ned strong and he did not care to inquire into the mysterious connexion which very soon after their first meeting at baymouth was established between sir francis clavering and the envoy of the nawaub <\s>
<s> the latter knew some secret regarding the former which put clavering into his power somehow and strong who knew that his patron's early life had been rather irregular and that his career with his regiment in india had not been brilliant supposed that the colonel who swore he knew clavering well at calcutta had some hold upon sir francis to which the latter was forced to yield <\s>
<s> in truth strong had long understood sir francis clavering's character as that of a man utterly weak in purpose in principle and intellect a moral and physical trifler and poltroon <\s>
<s> with poor clavering his excellency had had one or two interviews after their baymouth meeting the nature of which conversations the baronet did not confide to strong although he sent letters to altamont by that gentleman who was his ambassador in all sorts of affairs <\s>
<s> on one of these occasions the nawaub's envoy must have been in an exceeding ill humour for he crushed clavering's letter in his hand and said with his own particular manner and emphasis a hundred be hanged <\s>
<s> i'll have no more letters nor no more shilly shally <\s>
<s> tell clavering i'll have a thousand or by jove i'll split and burst him all to atoms <\s>
<s> let him give me a thousand and i'll go abroad and i give you my honour as a gentleman i'll not ask him for no more for a year <\s>
<s> give him that message from me strong my boy and tell him if the money ain't here next friday at twelve o'clock as sure as my name's what it is i'll have a paragraph in the newspaper on saturday and next week i'll blow up the whole concern <\s>
<s> strong carried back these words to his principal on whom their effect was such that actually on the day and hour appointed the chevalier made his appearance once more at altamont's hotel at baymouth with the sum of money required <\s>
<s> altamont was a gentleman he said and behaved as such he paid his bill at the inn and the baymouth paper announced his departure on a foreign tour <\s>
<s> strong saw him embark at dover <\s>
<s> it must be forgery at the very least he thought that has put clavering into this fellow's power and the colonel has got the bill <\s>
<s> before the year was out however this happy country saw the colonel once more upon its shores <\s>
<s> a confounded run on the red had finished him he said at baden baden no gentleman could stand against a colour coming up fourteen times <\s>
<s> he had been obliged to draw upon sir francis clavering for means of returning home and clavering though pressed for money for he had election expenses had set up his establishment in the country and was engaged in furnishing his london house yet found means to accept colonel altamont's bill though evidently very much against his will for in strong's hearing sir francis wished to heaven with many curses that the colonel could have been locked up in a debtor's goal in germany for life so that he might never be troubled again <\s>
<s> these sums for the colonel sir francis was obliged to raise without the knowledge of his wife for though perfectly liberal nay sumptuous in her expenditure the good lady had inherited a tolerable aptitude for business along with the large fortune of her father snell and gave to her husband only such a handsome allowance as she thought befitted a gentleman of his rank <\s>
<s> now and again she would give him a present or pay an outstanding gambling debt but she always exacted a pretty accurate account of the moneys so required and respecting the subsidies to the colonel clavering fairly told strong that he couldn't speak to his wife <\s>
<s> strong's business in life was to procure this money and other sums for his patron <\s>
<s> and in the chevalier's apartments in shepherd's inn many negotiations took place between gentlemen of the moneyed world and sir francis clavering and many valuable bank notes and pieces of stamped paper were passed between them <\s>

<s> as he had superintended the arrangements of the country mansion our friend the chevalier strong gave the benefit of his taste and advice to the fashionable london upholsterers who prepared the town house for the reception of the clavering family <\s>
<s> in the decoration of this elegant abode honest strong's soul rejoiced as much as if he had been himself its proprietor <\s>
<s> he hung and re hung the pictures he studied the positions of sofas he had interviews with wine merchants and purveyors who were to supply the new establishment and at the same time the baronet's factotum and confidential friend took the opportunity of furnishing his own chambers and stocking his snug little cellar his friends complimented him upon the neatness of the former and the select guests who came in to share strong's cutlet new found a bottle of excellent claret to accompany the meal <\s>
<s> the chevalier was now as he said in clover he had a very comfortable set of rooms in shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> he was waited on by a former spanish legionary and comrade of his whom he had left at a breach of a spanish fort and found at a crossing in tottenham court road and whom he had elevated to the rank of body servant to himself and to the chum who at present shared his lodgings <\s>
<s> this was no other than the favourite of the nawaub of lucknow the valiant colonel altamont <\s>
<s> no man was less curious or at any rate more discreet than ned strong and he did not care to inquire into the mysterious connexion which very soon after their first meeting at baymouth was established between sir francis clavering and the envoy of the nawaub <\s>
<s> the latter knew some secret regarding the former which put clavering into his power somehow and strong who knew that his patron's early life had been rather irregular and that his career with his regiment in india had not been brilliant supposed that the colonel who swore he knew clavering well at calcutta had some hold upon sir francis to which the latter was forced to yield <\s>
<s> in truth strong had long understood sir francis clavering's character as that of a man utterly weak in purpose in principle and intellect a moral and physical trifler and poltroon <\s>
<s> with poor clavering his excellency had had one or two interviews after their baymouth meeting the nature of which conversations the baronet did not confide to strong although he sent letters to altamont by that gentleman who was his ambassador in all sorts of affairs <\s>

<s> strong carried back these words to his principal on whom their effect was such that actually on the day and hour appointed the chevalier made his appearance once more at altamont's hotel at baymouth with the sum of money required <\s>
<s> altamont was a gentleman he said and behaved as such he paid his bill at the inn and the baymouth paper announced his departure on a foreign tour <\s>

<s> he had been obliged to draw upon sir francis clavering for means of returning home and clavering though pressed for money for he had election expenses had set up his establishment in the country and was engaged in furnishing his london house yet found means to accept colonel altamont's bill though evidently very much against his will for in strong's hearing sir francis wished to heaven with many curses that the colonel could have been locked up in a debtor's goal in germany for life so that he might never be troubled again <\s>
<s> these sums for the colonel sir francis was obliged to raise without the knowledge of his wife for though perfectly liberal nay sumptuous in her expenditure the good lady had inherited a tolerable aptitude for business along with the large fortune of her father snell and gave to her husband only such a handsome allowance as she thought befitted a gentleman of his rank <\s>

<s> clavering found it more convenient to see these gentry at strong's lodgings than at his own and such was the chevalier's friendship for the baronet that although he did not possess a shilling of his own his name might be seen as the drawer of almost all the bills of exchange which sir francis clavering accepted <\s>

<s> when nobody was near our little sylphide who scarcely ate at dinner more than the six grains of rice of amina the friend of the ghouls in the arabian nights was most active with her knife and fork and consumed a very substantial portion of mutton cutlets in which piece of hypocrisy it is believed she resembled other young ladies of fashion <\s>
<s> pen and his uncle declined the refection but they admired the dining room with fitting compliments and pronounced it very chaste that being the proper phrase <\s>
<s> there were indeed high backed dutch chairs of the seventeenth century there was a sculptured carved buffet of the sixteenth there was a sideboard robbed out of the carved work of a church in the low countries and a large brass cathedral lamp over the round oak table there were old family portraits from wardour street and tapestry from france bits of armour double handed swords and battle axes made of carton pierre looking glasses statuettes of saints and dresden china nothing in a word could be chaster <\s>
<s> behind the dining room was the library fitted with busts and books all of a size and wonderful easy chairs and solemn bronzes in the severe classic style <\s>
<s> here it was that guarded by double doors sir francis smoked cigars and read bell's life in london and went to sleep after dinner when he was not smoking over the billiard table at his clubs or punting at the gambling houses in saint james's <\s>
<s> but what could equal the chaste splendour of the drawing rooms the carpets were so magnificently fluffy that your foot made no more noise on them than your shadow on their white ground bloomed roses and tulips as big as warming pans about the room were high chairs and low chairs bandy legged chairs chairs so attenuated that it was a wonder any but a sylph could sit upon them marquetterie tables covered with marvellous gimcracks china ornaments of all ages and countries bronzes gilt daggers books of beauty yataghans turkish papooshes and boxes of parisian bonbons <\s>
<s> wherever you sate down there were dresden shepherds and shepherdesses convenient at your elbow there were moreover light blue poodles and ducks and cocks and hens in porcelain there were nymphs by boucher and shepherdesses by greuze very chaste indeed there were muslin curtains and brocade curtains gilt cages with parroquets and love birds two squealing cockatoos each out squealing and out chattering the other a clock singing tunes on a console table and another booming the hours like great tom on the mantelpiece there was in a word everything that comfort could desire and the most elegant taste devise <\s>

<s> pen did not think fit to tell his uncle who was the author who had made use of that remarkable phrase and here descending from the green park the pair made their way into grosvenor place and to the door of the mansion occupied there by sir francis and lady clavering <\s>
<s> the dining room shutters of this handsome mansion were freshly gilded the knockers shone gorgeous upon the newly painted door the balcony before the drawing room bloomed with a portable garden of the most beautiful plants and with flowers white and pink and scarlet the windows of the upper room the sacred chamber and dressing room of my lady doubtless and even a pretty little casement of the third story which keen sighted mr <\s>
<s> pen presumed to belong to the virgin bedroom of miss blanche amory were similarly adorned with floral ornaments and the whole exterior face of the house presented the most brilliant aspect which fresh new paint shining plate glass newly cleaned bricks and spotless mortar could offer to the beholder <\s>
<s> how strong must have rejoiced in organising all this splendour thought pen <\s>
<s> he recognised the chevalier's genius in the magnificence before him <\s>
<s> lady clavering is going out for her drive the major said <\s>
<s> we shall only have to leave our pasteboards arthur <\s>
<s> he used the word pasteboards having heard it from some of the ingenuous youth of the nobility about town and as a modern phrase suited to pen's tender years <\s>
<s> indeed as the two gentlemen reached the door a landau drove up a magnificent yellow carriage lined with brocade or satin of a faint cream colour drawn by wonderful grey horses with flaming ribbons and harness blazing all over with crests no less than three of these heraldic emblems surmounted the coats of arms on the panels and these shields contained a prodigious number of quarterings betokening the antiquity and splendour of the house of clavering and snell <\s>
<s> a coachman in a tight silver wig surmounted the magnificent hammer cloth whereon the same arms were worked in bullion and controlled the prancing greys a young man still but of a solemn countenance with a laced waistcoat and buckles in his shoes little buckles unlike those which john and jeames the footmen wear and which we know are large and spread elegantly over the foot <\s>
<s> one of the leaves of the hall door was opened and john one of the largest of his race was leaning against the door pillar with his ambrosial hair powdered his legs crossed beautiful silk stockinged in his hand his cane gold headed dolichoskion <\s>
<s> jeames was invisible but near at hand waiting in the hall with the gentleman who does not wear livery and ready to fling down the roll of hair cloth over which her ladyship was to step to her carriage <\s>
<s> these things and men the which to tell of demands time are seen in the glance of a practised eye and in fact the major and pen had scarcely crossed the street when the second battant of the door flew open the horse hair carpet tumbled down the door steps to those of the carriage john was opening it on one side of the emblazoned door and jeames on the other the two ladies attired in the highest style of fashion and accompanied by a third who carried a blenheim spaniel yelping in a light blue ribbon came forth to ascend the carriage <\s>
<s> miss amory was the first to enter which she did with aerial lightness and took the place which she liked best <\s>
<s> lady clavering next followed but her ladyship was more mature of age and heavy of foot and one of those feet attired in a green satin boot with some part of a stocking which was very fine whatever the ankle might be which it encircled might be seen swaying on the carriage step as her ladyship leaned for support on the arm of the unbending jeames by the enraptured observer of female beauty who happened to be passing at the time of this imposing ceremonial <\s>
<s> the pendennises senior and junior beheld those charms as they came up to the door the major looking grave and courtly and pen somewhat abashed at the carriage and its owners for he thought of sundry little passages at clavering which made his heart beat rather quick <\s>
<s> at that moment lady clavering looking round the pair she was on the first carriage step and would have been in the vehicle in another second but she gave a start backwards which caused some of the powder to fly from the hair of ambrosial jeames and crying out lor if it isn't arthur pendennis and the old major <\s>
<s> jumped back to terra firma directly and holding out two fat hands encased in tight orange coloured gloves the good natured woman warmly greeted the major and his nephew <\s>

<s> we've been waitin and waitin for you ever so long <\s>
<s> come in luncheon ain't gone down cried out this hospitable lady squeezing pen's hand in both hers she had dropped the major's after a brief wrench of recognition and blanche casting up her eyes towards the chimneys descended from the carriage presently with a timid blushing appealing look and gave a little hand to major pendennis <\s>
<s> the companion with the spaniel looked about irresolute and doubting whether she should not take fido his airing but she too turned right about face and entered the house after lady clavering her daughter and the two gentlemen <\s>

<s> a coachman in a tight silver wig surmounted the magnificent hammer cloth whereon the same arms were worked in bullion and controlled the prancing greys a young man still but of a solemn countenance with a laced waistcoat and buckles in his shoes little buckles unlike those which john and jeames the footmen wear and which we know are large and spread elegantly over the foot <\s>

<s> the pendennises senior and junior beheld those charms as they came up to the door the major looking grave and courtly and pen somewhat abashed at the carriage and its owners for he thought of sundry little passages at clavering which made his heart beat rather quick <\s>

<s> the companion with the spaniel looked about irresolute and doubting whether she should not take fido his airing but she too turned right about face and entered the house after lady clavering her daughter and the two gentlemen <\s>

<s> in which the sylph reappears better folks than morgan the valet were not so well instructed as that gentleman regarding the amount of lady clavering's riches and the legend in london upon her ladyship's arrival in the polite metropolis was that her fortune was enormous <\s>

<s> as he had superintended the arrangements of the country mansion our friend the chevalier strong gave the benefit of his taste and advice to the fashionable london upholsterers who prepared the town house for the reception of the clavering family <\s>
<s> in the decoration of this elegant abode honest strong's soul rejoiced as much as if he had been himself its proprietor <\s>
<s> he hung and re hung the pictures he studied the positions of sofas he had interviews with wine merchants and purveyors who were to supply the new establishment and at the same time the baronet's factotum and confidential friend took the opportunity of furnishing his own chambers and stocking his snug little cellar his friends complimented him upon the neatness of the former and the select guests who came in to share strong's cutlet new found a bottle of excellent claret to accompany the meal <\s>
<s> the chevalier was now as he said in clover he had a very comfortable set of rooms in shepherd's inn <\s>

<s> this was no other than the favourite of the nawaub of lucknow the valiant colonel altamont <\s>

<s> the latter knew some secret regarding the former which put clavering into his power somehow and strong who knew that his patron's early life had been rather irregular and that his career with his regiment in india had not been brilliant supposed that the colonel who swore he knew clavering well at calcutta had some hold upon sir francis to which the latter was forced to yield <\s>
<s> in truth strong had long understood sir francis clavering's character as that of a man utterly weak in purpose in principle and intellect a moral and physical trifler and poltroon <\s>
<s> with poor clavering his excellency had had one or two interviews after their baymouth meeting the nature of which conversations the baronet did not confide to strong although he sent letters to altamont by that gentleman who was his ambassador in all sorts of affairs <\s>
<s> on one of these occasions the nawaub's envoy must have been in an exceeding ill humour for he crushed clavering's letter in his hand and said with his own particular manner and emphasis a hundred be hanged <\s>

<s> strong carried back these words to his principal on whom their effect was such that actually on the day and hour appointed the chevalier made his appearance once more at altamont's hotel at baymouth with the sum of money required <\s>
<s> altamont was a gentleman he said and behaved as such he paid his bill at the inn and the baymouth paper announced his departure on a foreign tour <\s>
<s> strong saw him embark at dover <\s>
<s> it must be forgery at the very least he thought that has put clavering into this fellow's power and the colonel has got the bill <\s>
<s> before the year was out however this happy country saw the colonel once more upon its shores <\s>
<s> a confounded run on the red had finished him he said at baden baden no gentleman could stand against a colour coming up fourteen times <\s>
<s> he had been obliged to draw upon sir francis clavering for means of returning home and clavering though pressed for money for he had election expenses had set up his establishment in the country and was engaged in furnishing his london house yet found means to accept colonel altamont's bill though evidently very much against his will for in strong's hearing sir francis wished to heaven with many curses that the colonel could have been locked up in a debtor's goal in germany for life so that he might never be troubled again <\s>
<s> these sums for the colonel sir francis was obliged to raise without the knowledge of his wife for though perfectly liberal nay sumptuous in her expenditure the good lady had inherited a tolerable aptitude for business along with the large fortune of her father snell and gave to her husband only such a handsome allowance as she thought befitted a gentleman of his rank <\s>
<s> now and again she would give him a present or pay an outstanding gambling debt but she always exacted a pretty accurate account of the moneys so required and respecting the subsidies to the colonel clavering fairly told strong that he couldn't speak to his wife <\s>
<s> strong's business in life was to procure this money and other sums for his patron <\s>
<s> and in the chevalier's apartments in shepherd's inn many negotiations took place between gentlemen of the moneyed world and sir francis clavering and many valuable bank notes and pieces of stamped paper were passed between them <\s>
<s> when a man has been in the habit of getting in debt from his early youth and of exchanging his promises to pay at twelve months against present sums of money it would seem as if no piece of good fortune ever permanently benefited him a little while after the advent of prosperity the money lender is pretty certain to be in the house again and the bills with the old signature in the market <\s>
<s> clavering found it more convenient to see these gentry at strong's lodgings than at his own and such was the chevalier's friendship for the baronet that although he did not possess a shilling of his own his name might be seen as the drawer of almost all the bills of exchange which sir francis clavering accepted <\s>
<s> having drawn clavering's bills he got them discounted in the city <\s>
<s> when they became due he parleyed with the bill holders and gave them instalments of their debt or got time in exchange for fresh acceptances <\s>
<s> regularly or irregularly gentlemen must live somehow and as we read how the other day at comorn the troops forming that garrison were gay and lively acted plays danced at balls and consumed their rations though menaced with an assault from the enemy without the walls and with a gallows if the austrians were successful so there are hundreds of gallant spirits in this town walking about in good spirits dining every day in tolerable gaiety and plenty and going to sleep comfortably with a bailiff always more or less near and a rope of debt round their necks the which trifling inconveniences ned strong the old soldier bore very easily <\s>
<s> but we shall have another opportunity of making acquaintance with these and some other interesting inhabitants of shepherd's inn and in the meanwhile are keeping lady clavering and her friends too long waiting on the door steps of grosvenor place <\s>
<s> first they went into the gorgeous dining room fitted up lady clavering couldn't for goodness gracious tell why in the middle aged style unless said her good natured ladyship laughing because me and clavering are middle aged people and here they were offered the copious remains of the luncheon of which lady clavering and blanche had just partaken <\s>
<s> when nobody was near our little sylphide who scarcely ate at dinner more than the six grains of rice of amina the friend of the ghouls in the arabian nights was most active with her knife and fork and consumed a very substantial portion of mutton cutlets in which piece of hypocrisy it is believed she resembled other young ladies of fashion <\s>
<s> pen and his uncle declined the refection but they admired the dining room with fitting compliments and pronounced it very chaste that being the proper phrase <\s>
<s> there were indeed high backed dutch chairs of the seventeenth century there was a sculptured carved buffet of the sixteenth there was a sideboard robbed out of the carved work of a church in the low countries and a large brass cathedral lamp over the round oak table there were old family portraits from wardour street and tapestry from france bits of armour double handed swords and battle axes made of carton pierre looking glasses statuettes of saints and dresden china nothing in a word could be chaster <\s>
<s> behind the dining room was the library fitted with busts and books all of a size and wonderful easy chairs and solemn bronzes in the severe classic style <\s>
<s> here it was that guarded by double doors sir francis smoked cigars and read bell's life in london and went to sleep after dinner when he was not smoking over the billiard table at his clubs or punting at the gambling houses in saint james's <\s>
<s> but what could equal the chaste splendour of the drawing rooms the carpets were so magnificently fluffy that your foot made no more noise on them than your shadow on their white ground bloomed roses and tulips as big as warming pans about the room were high chairs and low chairs bandy legged chairs chairs so attenuated that it was a wonder any but a sylph could sit upon them marquetterie tables covered with marvellous gimcracks china ornaments of all ages and countries bronzes gilt daggers books of beauty yataghans turkish papooshes and boxes of parisian bonbons <\s>
<s> wherever you sate down there were dresden shepherds and shepherdesses convenient at your elbow there were moreover light blue poodles and ducks and cocks and hens in porcelain there were nymphs by boucher and shepherdesses by greuze very chaste indeed there were muslin curtains and brocade curtains gilt cages with parroquets and love birds two squealing cockatoos each out squealing and out chattering the other a clock singing tunes on a console table and another booming the hours like great tom on the mantelpiece there was in a word everything that comfort could desire and the most elegant taste devise <\s>
<s> a london drawing room fitted up without regard to expense is surely one of the noblest and most curious sights of the present day <\s>
<s> he is now upstairs at bays's playing picquet with count punter he is the second best player in england as well he may be for he plays every day of his life except sundays for sir hugh is an uncommonly religious man from half past three till half past seven when he dresses for dinner <\s>
<s> a very pious manner of spending his time pen said laughing and thinking that his uncle was falling into the twaddling state <\s>
<s> gad sir that is not the question <\s>
<s> a man of his estate may employ his time as he chooses <\s>
<s> when you are a baronet a county member with ten thousand acres of the best land in cheshire and such a place as trumpington though he never goes there you may do as you like <\s>
<s> and so that was his brougham sir was it <\s>
<s> the nephew said with almost a sneer <\s>
<s> his brougham o ay yes and that brings me back to my point revenons a nos moutons <\s>
<s> revenons a nous moutons <\s>
<s> well that brougham is mine if i choose between four and seven <\s>
<s> just as much mine as if i jobbed it from tilbury's begad for thirty pound a month <\s>
<s> sir hugh is the best natured fellow in the world and if it hadn't been so fine an afternoon as it is you and i would have been in that brougham at this very minute on our way to grosvenor place <\s>
<s> that is the benefit of knowing rich men i dine for nothing sir i go into the country and i'm mounted for nothing <\s>
<s> other fellows keep hounds and gamekeepers for me <\s>
<s> sic vos non vobis as we used to say at grey friars hey <\s>
<s> i'm of the opinion of my old friend leech of the forty fourth and a devilish good shrewd fellow he was as most scotchmen are <\s>
<s> gad sir leech used to say he was so poor that he couldn't afford to know a poor man you don't act up to your principles uncle pen said good naturedly <\s>
<s> up to my principles how sir <\s>
<s> the major asked rather testily <\s>
<s> you would have cut me in saint james's street sir pen said were your practice not more benevolent than your theory you who live with dukes and magnates of the land and would take no notice of a poor devil like me <\s>
<s> by which speech we may see that mr <\s>

<s> pen and his uncle declined the refection but they admired the dining room with fitting compliments and pronounced it very chaste that being the proper phrase <\s>
<s> there were indeed high backed dutch chairs of the seventeenth century there was a sculptured carved buffet of the sixteenth there was a sideboard robbed out of the carved work of a church in the low countries and a large brass cathedral lamp over the round oak table there were old family portraits from wardour street and tapestry from france bits of armour double handed swords and battle axes made of carton pierre looking glasses statuettes of saints and dresden china nothing in a word could be chaster <\s>
<s> behind the dining room was the library fitted with busts and books all of a size and wonderful easy chairs and solemn bronzes in the severe classic style <\s>
<s> here it was that guarded by double doors sir francis smoked cigars and read bell's life in london and went to sleep after dinner when he was not smoking over the billiard table at his clubs or punting at the gambling houses in saint james's <\s>
<s> but what could equal the chaste splendour of the drawing rooms the carpets were so magnificently fluffy that your foot made no more noise on them than your shadow on their white ground bloomed roses and tulips as big as warming pans about the room were high chairs and low chairs bandy legged chairs chairs so attenuated that it was a wonder any but a sylph could sit upon them marquetterie tables covered with marvellous gimcracks china ornaments of all ages and countries bronzes gilt daggers books of beauty yataghans turkish papooshes and boxes of parisian bonbons <\s>
<s> wherever you sate down there were dresden shepherds and shepherdesses convenient at your elbow there were moreover light blue poodles and ducks and cocks and hens in porcelain there were nymphs by boucher and shepherdesses by greuze very chaste indeed there were muslin curtains and brocade curtains gilt cages with parroquets and love birds two squealing cockatoos each out squealing and out chattering the other a clock singing tunes on a console table and another booming the hours like great tom on the mantelpiece there was in a word everything that comfort could desire and the most elegant taste devise <\s>

<s> a coachman in a tight silver wig surmounted the magnificent hammer cloth whereon the same arms were worked in bullion and controlled the prancing greys a young man still but of a solemn countenance with a laced waistcoat and buckles in his shoes little buckles unlike those which john and jeames the footmen wear and which we know are large and spread elegantly over the foot <\s>

<s> the pendennises senior and junior beheld those charms as they came up to the door the major looking grave and courtly and pen somewhat abashed at the carriage and its owners for he thought of sundry little passages at clavering which made his heart beat rather quick <\s>
<s> at that moment lady clavering looking round the pair she was on the first carriage step and would have been in the vehicle in another second but she gave a start backwards which caused some of the powder to fly from the hair of ambrosial jeames and crying out lor if it isn't arthur pendennis and the old major <\s>
<s> jumped back to terra firma directly and holding out two fat hands encased in tight orange coloured gloves the good natured woman warmly greeted the major and his nephew <\s>
<s> come in both of you why haven't you been before get out blanche and come and see your old friends o i'm so glad to see you <\s>

<s> come in luncheon ain't gone down cried out this hospitable lady squeezing pen's hand in both hers she had dropped the major's after a brief wrench of recognition and blanche casting up her eyes towards the chimneys descended from the carriage presently with a timid blushing appealing look and gave a little hand to major pendennis <\s>
<s> the companion with the spaniel looked about irresolute and doubting whether she should not take fido his airing but she too turned right about face and entered the house after lady clavering her daughter and the two gentlemen <\s>
<s> and the carriage with the prancing greys was left unoccupied save by the coachman in the silver wig <\s>
<s> in which the sylph reappears better folks than morgan the valet were not so well instructed as that gentleman regarding the amount of lady clavering's riches and the legend in london upon her ladyship's arrival in the polite metropolis was that her fortune was enormous <\s>
<s> indigo factories opium clippers banks overflowing with rupees diamonds and jewels of native princes and vast sums of interest paid by them for loans contracted by themselves or their predecessors to lady clavering's father were mentioned as sources of her wealth <\s>
<s> her account at her london banker's was positively known and the sum embraced so many cyphers as to create as many o's of admiration in the wondering hearer <\s>
<s> it was a known fact that an envoy from an indian prince a colonel altamont the nawaub of lucknow's prime favourite an extraordinary man who had it was said embraced mahometanism and undergone a thousand wild and perilous adventures was at present in this country trying to negotiate with the begum clavering the sale of the nawaub's celebrated nose ring diamond the light of the dewan <\s>
<s> under the title of the begum lady clavering's fame began to spread in london before she herself descended upon the capital and as it has been the boast of delolme and blackstone and all panegyrists of the british constitution that we admit into our aristocracy merit of every kind and that the lowliest born man if he but deserve it may wear the robes of a peer and sit alongside of a cavendish or a stanley so it ought to be the boast of our good society that haughty though it be naturally jealous of its privileges and careful who shall be admitted into its circle yet if an individual be but rich enough all barriers are instantly removed and he or she is welcomed as from his wealth he merits to be <\s>
<s> this fact shows our british independence and honest feeling our higher orders are not such mere haughty aristocrats as the ignorant represent them on the contrary if a man have money they will hold out their hands to him eat his dinners dance at his balls marry his daughters or give their own lovely girls to his sons as affably as your commonest roturier would do <\s>
<s> as he had superintended the arrangements of the country mansion our friend the chevalier strong gave the benefit of his taste and advice to the fashionable london upholsterers who prepared the town house for the reception of the clavering family <\s>
<s> in the decoration of this elegant abode honest strong's soul rejoiced as much as if he had been himself its proprietor <\s>
<s> he hung and re hung the pictures he studied the positions of sofas he had interviews with wine merchants and purveyors who were to supply the new establishment and at the same time the baronet's factotum and confidential friend took the opportunity of furnishing his own chambers and stocking his snug little cellar his friends complimented him upon the neatness of the former and the select guests who came in to share strong's cutlet new found a bottle of excellent claret to accompany the meal <\s>
<s> the chevalier was now as he said in clover he had a very comfortable set of rooms in shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> he was waited on by a former spanish legionary and comrade of his whom he had left at a breach of a spanish fort and found at a crossing in tottenham court road and whom he had elevated to the rank of body servant to himself and to the chum who at present shared his lodgings <\s>
<s> this was no other than the favourite of the nawaub of lucknow the valiant colonel altamont <\s>
<s> no man was less curious or at any rate more discreet than ned strong and he did not care to inquire into the mysterious connexion which very soon after their first meeting at baymouth was established between sir francis clavering and the envoy of the nawaub <\s>
<s> the latter knew some secret regarding the former which put clavering into his power somehow and strong who knew that his patron's early life had been rather irregular and that his career with his regiment in india had not been brilliant supposed that the colonel who swore he knew clavering well at calcutta had some hold upon sir francis to which the latter was forced to yield <\s>
<s> in truth strong had long understood sir francis clavering's character as that of a man utterly weak in purpose in principle and intellect a moral and physical trifler and poltroon <\s>
<s> with poor clavering his excellency had had one or two interviews after their baymouth meeting the nature of which conversations the baronet did not confide to strong although he sent letters to altamont by that gentleman who was his ambassador in all sorts of affairs <\s>
<s> on one of these occasions the nawaub's envoy must have been in an exceeding ill humour for he crushed clavering's letter in his hand and said with his own particular manner and emphasis a hundred be hanged <\s>
<s> i'll have no more letters nor no more shilly shally <\s>
<s> tell clavering i'll have a thousand or by jove i'll split and burst him all to atoms <\s>
<s> let him give me a thousand and i'll go abroad and i give you my honour as a gentleman i'll not ask him for no more for a year <\s>
<s> give him that message from me strong my boy and tell him if the money ain't here next friday at twelve o'clock as sure as my name's what it is i'll have a paragraph in the newspaper on saturday and next week i'll blow up the whole concern <\s>
<s> strong carried back these words to his principal on whom their effect was such that actually on the day and hour appointed the chevalier made his appearance once more at altamont's hotel at baymouth with the sum of money required <\s>
<s> altamont was a gentleman he said and behaved as such he paid his bill at the inn and the baymouth paper announced his departure on a foreign tour <\s>
<s> strong saw him embark at dover <\s>
<s> it must be forgery at the very least he thought that has put clavering into this fellow's power and the colonel has got the bill <\s>
<s> before the year was out however this happy country saw the colonel once more upon its shores <\s>
<s> a confounded run on the red had finished him he said at baden baden no gentleman could stand against a colour coming up fourteen times <\s>
<s> he had been obliged to draw upon sir francis clavering for means of returning home and clavering though pressed for money for he had election expenses had set up his establishment in the country and was engaged in furnishing his london house yet found means to accept colonel altamont's bill though evidently very much against his will for in strong's hearing sir francis wished to heaven with many curses that the colonel could have been locked up in a debtor's goal in germany for life so that he might never be troubled again <\s>
<s> these sums for the colonel sir francis was obliged to raise without the knowledge of his wife for though perfectly liberal nay sumptuous in her expenditure the good lady had inherited a tolerable aptitude for business along with the large fortune of her father snell and gave to her husband only such a handsome allowance as she thought befitted a gentleman of his rank <\s>
<s> now and again she would give him a present or pay an outstanding gambling debt but she always exacted a pretty accurate account of the moneys so required and respecting the subsidies to the colonel clavering fairly told strong that he couldn't speak to his wife <\s>
<s> strong's business in life was to procure this money and other sums for his patron <\s>
<s> and in the chevalier's apartments in shepherd's inn many negotiations took place between gentlemen of the moneyed world and sir francis clavering and many valuable bank notes and pieces of stamped paper were passed between them <\s>
<s> when a man has been in the habit of getting in debt from his early youth and of exchanging his promises to pay at twelve months against present sums of money it would seem as if no piece of good fortune ever permanently benefited him a little while after the advent of prosperity the money lender is pretty certain to be in the house again and the bills with the old signature in the market <\s>
<s> clavering found it more convenient to see these gentry at strong's lodgings than at his own and such was the chevalier's friendship for the baronet that although he did not possess a shilling of his own his name might be seen as the drawer of almost all the bills of exchange which sir francis clavering accepted <\s>
<s> having drawn clavering's bills he got them discounted in the city <\s>

<s> the chevalier was now as he said in clover he had a very comfortable set of rooms in shepherd's inn <\s>

<s> this was no other than the favourite of the nawaub of lucknow the valiant colonel altamont <\s>

<s> in truth strong had long understood sir francis clavering's character as that of a man utterly weak in purpose in principle and intellect a moral and physical trifler and poltroon <\s>
<s> with poor clavering his excellency had had one or two interviews after their baymouth meeting the nature of which conversations the baronet did not confide to strong although he sent letters to altamont by that gentleman who was his ambassador in all sorts of affairs <\s>

<s> these sums for the colonel sir francis was obliged to raise without the knowledge of his wife for though perfectly liberal nay sumptuous in her expenditure the good lady had inherited a tolerable aptitude for business along with the large fortune of her father snell and gave to her husband only such a handsome allowance as she thought befitted a gentleman of his rank <\s>

<s> clavering found it more convenient to see these gentry at strong's lodgings than at his own and such was the chevalier's friendship for the baronet that although he did not possess a shilling of his own his name might be seen as the drawer of almost all the bills of exchange which sir francis clavering accepted <\s>

<s> behind the dining room was the library fitted with busts and books all of a size and wonderful easy chairs and solemn bronzes in the severe classic style <\s>

<s> but what could equal the chaste splendour of the drawing rooms the carpets were so magnificently fluffy that your foot made no more noise on them than your shadow on their white ground bloomed roses and tulips as big as warming pans about the room were high chairs and low chairs bandy legged chairs chairs so attenuated that it was a wonder any but a sylph could sit upon them marquetterie tables covered with marvellous gimcracks china ornaments of all ages and countries bronzes gilt daggers books of beauty yataghans turkish papooshes and boxes of parisian bonbons <\s>
<s> wherever you sate down there were dresden shepherds and shepherdesses convenient at your elbow there were moreover light blue poodles and ducks and cocks and hens in porcelain there were nymphs by boucher and shepherdesses by greuze very chaste indeed there were muslin curtains and brocade curtains gilt cages with parroquets and love birds two squealing cockatoos each out squealing and out chattering the other a clock singing tunes on a console table and another booming the hours like great tom on the mantelpiece there was in a word everything that comfort could desire and the most elegant taste devise <\s>

<s> the dining room shutters of this handsome mansion were freshly gilded the knockers shone gorgeous upon the newly painted door the balcony before the drawing room bloomed with a portable garden of the most beautiful plants and with flowers white and pink and scarlet the windows of the upper room the sacred chamber and dressing room of my lady doubtless and even a pretty little casement of the third story which keen sighted mr <\s>

<s> we shall only have to leave our pasteboards arthur <\s>
<s> he used the word pasteboards having heard it from some of the ingenuous youth of the nobility about town and as a modern phrase suited to pen's tender years <\s>
<s> indeed as the two gentlemen reached the door a landau drove up a magnificent yellow carriage lined with brocade or satin of a faint cream colour drawn by wonderful grey horses with flaming ribbons and harness blazing all over with crests no less than three of these heraldic emblems surmounted the coats of arms on the panels and these shields contained a prodigious number of quarterings betokening the antiquity and splendour of the house of clavering and snell <\s>
<s> a coachman in a tight silver wig surmounted the magnificent hammer cloth whereon the same arms were worked in bullion and controlled the prancing greys a young man still but of a solemn countenance with a laced waistcoat and buckles in his shoes little buckles unlike those which john and jeames the footmen wear and which we know are large and spread elegantly over the foot <\s>
<s> one of the leaves of the hall door was opened and john one of the largest of his race was leaning against the door pillar with his ambrosial hair powdered his legs crossed beautiful silk stockinged in his hand his cane gold headed dolichoskion <\s>
<s> jeames was invisible but near at hand waiting in the hall with the gentleman who does not wear livery and ready to fling down the roll of hair cloth over which her ladyship was to step to her carriage <\s>
<s> these things and men the which to tell of demands time are seen in the glance of a practised eye and in fact the major and pen had scarcely crossed the street when the second battant of the door flew open the horse hair carpet tumbled down the door steps to those of the carriage john was opening it on one side of the emblazoned door and jeames on the other the two ladies attired in the highest style of fashion and accompanied by a third who carried a blenheim spaniel yelping in a light blue ribbon came forth to ascend the carriage <\s>
<s> miss amory was the first to enter which she did with aerial lightness and took the place which she liked best <\s>
<s> lady clavering next followed but her ladyship was more mature of age and heavy of foot and one of those feet attired in a green satin boot with some part of a stocking which was very fine whatever the ankle might be which it encircled might be seen swaying on the carriage step as her ladyship leaned for support on the arm of the unbending jeames by the enraptured observer of female beauty who happened to be passing at the time of this imposing ceremonial <\s>
<s> the pendennises senior and junior beheld those charms as they came up to the door the major looking grave and courtly and pen somewhat abashed at the carriage and its owners for he thought of sundry little passages at clavering which made his heart beat rather quick <\s>
<s> at that moment lady clavering looking round the pair she was on the first carriage step and would have been in the vehicle in another second but she gave a start backwards which caused some of the powder to fly from the hair of ambrosial jeames and crying out lor if it isn't arthur pendennis and the old major <\s>
<s> jumped back to terra firma directly and holding out two fat hands encased in tight orange coloured gloves the good natured woman warmly greeted the major and his nephew <\s>

<s> come in luncheon ain't gone down cried out this hospitable lady squeezing pen's hand in both hers she had dropped the major's after a brief wrench of recognition and blanche casting up her eyes towards the chimneys descended from the carriage presently with a timid blushing appealing look and gave a little hand to major pendennis <\s>
<s> the companion with the spaniel looked about irresolute and doubting whether she should not take fido his airing but she too turned right about face and entered the house after lady clavering her daughter and the two gentlemen <\s>

<s> in which the sylph reappears better folks than morgan the valet were not so well instructed as that gentleman regarding the amount of lady clavering's riches and the legend in london upon her ladyship's arrival in the polite metropolis was that her fortune was enormous <\s>

<s> her account at her london banker's was positively known and the sum embraced so many cyphers as to create as many o's of admiration in the wondering hearer <\s>
<s> it was a known fact that an envoy from an indian prince a colonel altamont the nawaub of lucknow's prime favourite an extraordinary man who had it was said embraced mahometanism and undergone a thousand wild and perilous adventures was at present in this country trying to negotiate with the begum clavering the sale of the nawaub's celebrated nose ring diamond the light of the dewan <\s>
<s> under the title of the begum lady clavering's fame began to spread in london before she herself descended upon the capital and as it has been the boast of delolme and blackstone and all panegyrists of the british constitution that we admit into our aristocracy merit of every kind and that the lowliest born man if he but deserve it may wear the robes of a peer and sit alongside of a cavendish or a stanley so it ought to be the boast of our good society that haughty though it be naturally jealous of its privileges and careful who shall be admitted into its circle yet if an individual be but rich enough all barriers are instantly removed and he or she is welcomed as from his wealth he merits to be <\s>

<s> indeed as the two gentlemen reached the door a landau drove up a magnificent yellow carriage lined with brocade or satin of a faint cream colour drawn by wonderful grey horses with flaming ribbons and harness blazing all over with crests no less than three of these heraldic emblems surmounted the coats of arms on the panels and these shields contained a prodigious number of quarterings betokening the antiquity and splendour of the house of clavering and snell <\s>
<s> a coachman in a tight silver wig surmounted the magnificent hammer cloth whereon the same arms were worked in bullion and controlled the prancing greys a young man still but of a solemn countenance with a laced waistcoat and buckles in his shoes little buckles unlike those which john and jeames the footmen wear and which we know are large and spread elegantly over the foot <\s>
<s> one of the leaves of the hall door was opened and john one of the largest of his race was leaning against the door pillar with his ambrosial hair powdered his legs crossed beautiful silk stockinged in his hand his cane gold headed dolichoskion <\s>

<s> these things and men the which to tell of demands time are seen in the glance of a practised eye and in fact the major and pen had scarcely crossed the street when the second battant of the door flew open the horse hair carpet tumbled down the door steps to those of the carriage john was opening it on one side of the emblazoned door and jeames on the other the two ladies attired in the highest style of fashion and accompanied by a third who carried a blenheim spaniel yelping in a light blue ribbon came forth to ascend the carriage <\s>
<s> miss amory was the first to enter which she did with aerial lightness and took the place which she liked best <\s>
<s> lady clavering next followed but her ladyship was more mature of age and heavy of foot and one of those feet attired in a green satin boot with some part of a stocking which was very fine whatever the ankle might be which it encircled might be seen swaying on the carriage step as her ladyship leaned for support on the arm of the unbending jeames by the enraptured observer of female beauty who happened to be passing at the time of this imposing ceremonial <\s>
<s> the pendennises senior and junior beheld those charms as they came up to the door the major looking grave and courtly and pen somewhat abashed at the carriage and its owners for he thought of sundry little passages at clavering which made his heart beat rather quick <\s>
<s> at that moment lady clavering looking round the pair she was on the first carriage step and would have been in the vehicle in another second but she gave a start backwards which caused some of the powder to fly from the hair of ambrosial jeames and crying out lor if it isn't arthur pendennis and the old major <\s>
<s> jumped back to terra firma directly and holding out two fat hands encased in tight orange coloured gloves the good natured woman warmly greeted the major and his nephew <\s>

<s> come in luncheon ain't gone down cried out this hospitable lady squeezing pen's hand in both hers she had dropped the major's after a brief wrench of recognition and blanche casting up her eyes towards the chimneys descended from the carriage presently with a timid blushing appealing look and gave a little hand to major pendennis <\s>
<s> the companion with the spaniel looked about irresolute and doubting whether she should not take fido his airing but she too turned right about face and entered the house after lady clavering her daughter and the two gentlemen <\s>
<s> and the carriage with the prancing greys was left unoccupied save by the coachman in the silver wig <\s>
<s> in which the sylph reappears better folks than morgan the valet were not so well instructed as that gentleman regarding the amount of lady clavering's riches and the legend in london upon her ladyship's arrival in the polite metropolis was that her fortune was enormous <\s>
<s> indigo factories opium clippers banks overflowing with rupees diamonds and jewels of native princes and vast sums of interest paid by them for loans contracted by themselves or their predecessors to lady clavering's father were mentioned as sources of her wealth <\s>
<s> her account at her london banker's was positively known and the sum embraced so many cyphers as to create as many o's of admiration in the wondering hearer <\s>
<s> it was a known fact that an envoy from an indian prince a colonel altamont the nawaub of lucknow's prime favourite an extraordinary man who had it was said embraced mahometanism and undergone a thousand wild and perilous adventures was at present in this country trying to negotiate with the begum clavering the sale of the nawaub's celebrated nose ring diamond the light of the dewan <\s>
<s> under the title of the begum lady clavering's fame began to spread in london before she herself descended upon the capital and as it has been the boast of delolme and blackstone and all panegyrists of the british constitution that we admit into our aristocracy merit of every kind and that the lowliest born man if he but deserve it may wear the robes of a peer and sit alongside of a cavendish or a stanley so it ought to be the boast of our good society that haughty though it be naturally jealous of its privileges and careful who shall be admitted into its circle yet if an individual be but rich enough all barriers are instantly removed and he or she is welcomed as from his wealth he merits to be <\s>
<s> this fact shows our british independence and honest feeling our higher orders are not such mere haughty aristocrats as the ignorant represent them on the contrary if a man have money they will hold out their hands to him eat his dinners dance at his balls marry his daughters or give their own lovely girls to his sons as affably as your commonest roturier would do <\s>
<s> as he had superintended the arrangements of the country mansion our friend the chevalier strong gave the benefit of his taste and advice to the fashionable london upholsterers who prepared the town house for the reception of the clavering family <\s>
<s> in the decoration of this elegant abode honest strong's soul rejoiced as much as if he had been himself its proprietor <\s>
<s> he hung and re hung the pictures he studied the positions of sofas he had interviews with wine merchants and purveyors who were to supply the new establishment and at the same time the baronet's factotum and confidential friend took the opportunity of furnishing his own chambers and stocking his snug little cellar his friends complimented him upon the neatness of the former and the select guests who came in to share strong's cutlet new found a bottle of excellent claret to accompany the meal <\s>
<s> the chevalier was now as he said in clover he had a very comfortable set of rooms in shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> he was waited on by a former spanish legionary and comrade of his whom he had left at a breach of a spanish fort and found at a crossing in tottenham court road and whom he had elevated to the rank of body servant to himself and to the chum who at present shared his lodgings <\s>
<s> this was no other than the favourite of the nawaub of lucknow the valiant colonel altamont <\s>
<s> no man was less curious or at any rate more discreet than ned strong and he did not care to inquire into the mysterious connexion which very soon after their first meeting at baymouth was established between sir francis clavering and the envoy of the nawaub <\s>
<s> the latter knew some secret regarding the former which put clavering into his power somehow and strong who knew that his patron's early life had been rather irregular and that his career with his regiment in india had not been brilliant supposed that the colonel who swore he knew clavering well at calcutta had some hold upon sir francis to which the latter was forced to yield <\s>
<s> in truth strong had long understood sir francis clavering's character as that of a man utterly weak in purpose in principle and intellect a moral and physical trifler and poltroon <\s>
<s> with poor clavering his excellency had had one or two interviews after their baymouth meeting the nature of which conversations the baronet did not confide to strong although he sent letters to altamont by that gentleman who was his ambassador in all sorts of affairs <\s>
<s> on one of these occasions the nawaub's envoy must have been in an exceeding ill humour for he crushed clavering's letter in his hand and said with his own particular manner and emphasis a hundred be hanged <\s>

<s> give him that message from me strong my boy and tell him if the money ain't here next friday at twelve o'clock as sure as my name's what it is i'll have a paragraph in the newspaper on saturday and next week i'll blow up the whole concern <\s>
<s> strong carried back these words to his principal on whom their effect was such that actually on the day and hour appointed the chevalier made his appearance once more at altamont's hotel at baymouth with the sum of money required <\s>
<s> altamont was a gentleman he said and behaved as such he paid his bill at the inn and the baymouth paper announced his departure on a foreign tour <\s>
<s> strong saw him embark at dover <\s>
<s> it must be forgery at the very least he thought that has put clavering into this fellow's power and the colonel has got the bill <\s>
<s> before the year was out however this happy country saw the colonel once more upon its shores <\s>
<s> a confounded run on the red had finished him he said at baden baden no gentleman could stand against a colour coming up fourteen times <\s>
<s> he had been obliged to draw upon sir francis clavering for means of returning home and clavering though pressed for money for he had election expenses had set up his establishment in the country and was engaged in furnishing his london house yet found means to accept colonel altamont's bill though evidently very much against his will for in strong's hearing sir francis wished to heaven with many curses that the colonel could have been locked up in a debtor's goal in germany for life so that he might never be troubled again <\s>
<s> these sums for the colonel sir francis was obliged to raise without the knowledge of his wife for though perfectly liberal nay sumptuous in her expenditure the good lady had inherited a tolerable aptitude for business along with the large fortune of her father snell and gave to her husband only such a handsome allowance as she thought befitted a gentleman of his rank <\s>
<s> now and again she would give him a present or pay an outstanding gambling debt but she always exacted a pretty accurate account of the moneys so required and respecting the subsidies to the colonel clavering fairly told strong that he couldn't speak to his wife <\s>
<s> strong's business in life was to procure this money and other sums for his patron <\s>
<s> and in the chevalier's apartments in shepherd's inn many negotiations took place between gentlemen of the moneyed world and sir francis clavering and many valuable bank notes and pieces of stamped paper were passed between them <\s>
<s> when a man has been in the habit of getting in debt from his early youth and of exchanging his promises to pay at twelve months against present sums of money it would seem as if no piece of good fortune ever permanently benefited him a little while after the advent of prosperity the money lender is pretty certain to be in the house again and the bills with the old signature in the market <\s>
<s> clavering found it more convenient to see these gentry at strong's lodgings than at his own and such was the chevalier's friendship for the baronet that although he did not possess a shilling of his own his name might be seen as the drawer of almost all the bills of exchange which sir francis clavering accepted <\s>
<s> having drawn clavering's bills he got them discounted in the city <\s>
<s> when they became due he parleyed with the bill holders and gave them instalments of their debt or got time in exchange for fresh acceptances <\s>
<s> regularly or irregularly gentlemen must live somehow and as we read how the other day at comorn the troops forming that garrison were gay and lively acted plays danced at balls and consumed their rations though menaced with an assault from the enemy without the walls and with a gallows if the austrians were successful so there are hundreds of gallant spirits in this town walking about in good spirits dining every day in tolerable gaiety and plenty and going to sleep comfortably with a bailiff always more or less near and a rope of debt round their necks the which trifling inconveniences ned strong the old soldier bore very easily <\s>
<s> but we shall have another opportunity of making acquaintance with these and some other interesting inhabitants of shepherd's inn and in the meanwhile are keeping lady clavering and her friends too long waiting on the door steps of grosvenor place <\s>
<s> first they went into the gorgeous dining room fitted up lady clavering couldn't for goodness gracious tell why in the middle aged style unless said her good natured ladyship laughing because me and clavering are middle aged people and here they were offered the copious remains of the luncheon of which lady clavering and blanche had just partaken <\s>
<s> when nobody was near our little sylphide who scarcely ate at dinner more than the six grains of rice of amina the friend of the ghouls in the arabian nights was most active with her knife and fork and consumed a very substantial portion of mutton cutlets in which piece of hypocrisy it is believed she resembled other young ladies of fashion <\s>
<s> pen and his uncle declined the refection but they admired the dining room with fitting compliments and pronounced it very chaste that being the proper phrase <\s>
<s> there were indeed high backed dutch chairs of the seventeenth century there was a sculptured carved buffet of the sixteenth there was a sideboard robbed out of the carved work of a church in the low countries and a large brass cathedral lamp over the round oak table there were old family portraits from wardour street and tapestry from france bits of armour double handed swords and battle axes made of carton pierre looking glasses statuettes of saints and dresden china nothing in a word could be chaster <\s>
<s> behind the dining room was the library fitted with busts and books all of a size and wonderful easy chairs and solemn bronzes in the severe classic style <\s>
<s> here it was that guarded by double doors sir francis smoked cigars and read bell's life in london and went to sleep after dinner when he was not smoking over the billiard table at his clubs or punting at the gambling houses in saint james's <\s>
<s> but what could equal the chaste splendour of the drawing rooms the carpets were so magnificently fluffy that your foot made no more noise on them than your shadow on their white ground bloomed roses and tulips as big as warming pans about the room were high chairs and low chairs bandy legged chairs chairs so attenuated that it was a wonder any but a sylph could sit upon them marquetterie tables covered with marvellous gimcracks china ornaments of all ages and countries bronzes gilt daggers books of beauty yataghans turkish papooshes and boxes of parisian bonbons <\s>
<s> wherever you sate down there were dresden shepherds and shepherdesses convenient at your elbow there were moreover light blue poodles and ducks and cocks and hens in porcelain there were nymphs by boucher and shepherdesses by greuze very chaste indeed there were muslin curtains and brocade curtains gilt cages with parroquets and love birds two squealing cockatoos each out squealing and out chattering the other a clock singing tunes on a console table and another booming the hours like great tom on the mantelpiece there was in a word everything that comfort could desire and the most elegant taste devise <\s>
<s> a london drawing room fitted up without regard to expense is surely one of the noblest and most curious sights of the present day <\s>
<s> he is now upstairs at bays's playing picquet with count punter he is the second best player in england as well he may be for he plays every day of his life except sundays for sir hugh is an uncommonly religious man from half past three till half past seven when he dresses for dinner <\s>
<s> a very pious manner of spending his time pen said laughing and thinking that his uncle was falling into the twaddling state <\s>
<s> gad sir that is not the question <\s>
<s> a man of his estate may employ his time as he chooses <\s>
<s> when you are a baronet a county member with ten thousand acres of the best land in cheshire and such a place as trumpington though he never goes there you may do as you like <\s>
<s> and so that was his brougham sir was it <\s>
<s> the nephew said with almost a sneer <\s>
<s> his brougham o ay yes and that brings me back to my point revenons a nos moutons <\s>
<s> revenons a nous moutons <\s>
<s> well that brougham is mine if i choose between four and seven <\s>
<s> just as much mine as if i jobbed it from tilbury's begad for thirty pound a month <\s>
<s> sir hugh is the best natured fellow in the world and if it hadn't been so fine an afternoon as it is you and i would have been in that brougham at this very minute on our way to grosvenor place <\s>
<s> that is the benefit of knowing rich men i dine for nothing sir i go into the country and i'm mounted for nothing <\s>
<s> other fellows keep hounds and gamekeepers for me <\s>
<s> sic vos non vobis as we used to say at grey friars hey <\s>
<s> i'm of the opinion of my old friend leech of the forty fourth and a devilish good shrewd fellow he was as most scotchmen are <\s>
<s> gad sir leech used to say he was so poor that he couldn't afford to know a poor man you don't act up to your principles uncle pen said good naturedly <\s>
<s> up to my principles how sir <\s>
<s> the major asked rather testily <\s>
<s> you would have cut me in saint james's street sir pen said were your practice not more benevolent than your theory you who live with dukes and magnates of the land and would take no notice of a poor devil like me <\s>
<s> by which speech we may see that mr <\s>
<s> pen was getting on in the world and could flatter as well as laugh in his sleeve <\s>
<s> major pendennis was appeased instantly and very much pleased <\s>
<s> he tapped affectionately his nephew's arm on which he was leaning and said you sir you are my flesh and blood <\s>
<s> hang it sir i've been very proud of you and very fond of you but for your confounded follies and extravagances and wild oats sir which i hope you've sown em <\s>
<s> i hope you've sown em begad <\s>
<s> my object arthur is to make a man of you to see you well placed in the world as becomes one of your name and my own sir <\s>
<s> you have got yourself a little reputation by your literary talents which i am very far from undervaluing though in my time begad poetry and genius and that sort of thing were devilish disreputable <\s>
<s> there was poor byron for instance who ruined himself and contracted the worst habits by living with poets and newspaper writers and people of that kind but the times are changed now there's a run upon literature clever fellows get into the best houses in town begad <\s>
<s> tempora mutantur sir and by jove i suppose whatever is is right as shakspeare says <\s>
<s> pen did not think fit to tell his uncle who was the author who had made use of that remarkable phrase and here descending from the green park the pair made their way into grosvenor place and to the door of the mansion occupied there by sir francis and lady clavering <\s>
<s> the dining room shutters of this handsome mansion were freshly gilded the knockers shone gorgeous upon the newly painted door the balcony before the drawing room bloomed with a portable garden of the most beautiful plants and with flowers white and pink and scarlet the windows of the upper room the sacred chamber and dressing room of my lady doubtless and even a pretty little casement of the third story which keen sighted mr <\s>

<s> in which the sylph reappears better folks than morgan the valet were not so well instructed as that gentleman regarding the amount of lady clavering's riches and the legend in london upon her ladyship's arrival in the polite metropolis was that her fortune was enormous <\s>
<s> indigo factories opium clippers banks overflowing with rupees diamonds and jewels of native princes and vast sums of interest paid by them for loans contracted by themselves or their predecessors to lady clavering's father were mentioned as sources of her wealth <\s>
<s> her account at her london banker's was positively known and the sum embraced so many cyphers as to create as many o's of admiration in the wondering hearer <\s>
<s> it was a known fact that an envoy from an indian prince a colonel altamont the nawaub of lucknow's prime favourite an extraordinary man who had it was said embraced mahometanism and undergone a thousand wild and perilous adventures was at present in this country trying to negotiate with the begum clavering the sale of the nawaub's celebrated nose ring diamond the light of the dewan <\s>
<s> under the title of the begum lady clavering's fame began to spread in london before she herself descended upon the capital and as it has been the boast of delolme and blackstone and all panegyrists of the british constitution that we admit into our aristocracy merit of every kind and that the lowliest born man if he but deserve it may wear the robes of a peer and sit alongside of a cavendish or a stanley so it ought to be the boast of our good society that haughty though it be naturally jealous of its privileges and careful who shall be admitted into its circle yet if an individual be but rich enough all barriers are instantly removed and he or she is welcomed as from his wealth he merits to be <\s>

<s> as he had superintended the arrangements of the country mansion our friend the chevalier strong gave the benefit of his taste and advice to the fashionable london upholsterers who prepared the town house for the reception of the clavering family <\s>
<s> in the decoration of this elegant abode honest strong's soul rejoiced as much as if he had been himself its proprietor <\s>
<s> he hung and re hung the pictures he studied the positions of sofas he had interviews with wine merchants and purveyors who were to supply the new establishment and at the same time the baronet's factotum and confidential friend took the opportunity of furnishing his own chambers and stocking his snug little cellar his friends complimented him upon the neatness of the former and the select guests who came in to share strong's cutlet new found a bottle of excellent claret to accompany the meal <\s>
<s> the chevalier was now as he said in clover he had a very comfortable set of rooms in shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> he was waited on by a former spanish legionary and comrade of his whom he had left at a breach of a spanish fort and found at a crossing in tottenham court road and whom he had elevated to the rank of body servant to himself and to the chum who at present shared his lodgings <\s>
<s> this was no other than the favourite of the nawaub of lucknow the valiant colonel altamont <\s>
<s> no man was less curious or at any rate more discreet than ned strong and he did not care to inquire into the mysterious connexion which very soon after their first meeting at baymouth was established between sir francis clavering and the envoy of the nawaub <\s>
<s> the latter knew some secret regarding the former which put clavering into his power somehow and strong who knew that his patron's early life had been rather irregular and that his career with his regiment in india had not been brilliant supposed that the colonel who swore he knew clavering well at calcutta had some hold upon sir francis to which the latter was forced to yield <\s>
<s> in truth strong had long understood sir francis clavering's character as that of a man utterly weak in purpose in principle and intellect a moral and physical trifler and poltroon <\s>
<s> with poor clavering his excellency had had one or two interviews after their baymouth meeting the nature of which conversations the baronet did not confide to strong although he sent letters to altamont by that gentleman who was his ambassador in all sorts of affairs <\s>
<s> on one of these occasions the nawaub's envoy must have been in an exceeding ill humour for he crushed clavering's letter in his hand and said with his own particular manner and emphasis a hundred be hanged <\s>
<s> i'll have no more letters nor no more shilly shally <\s>
<s> tell clavering i'll have a thousand or by jove i'll split and burst him all to atoms <\s>
<s> let him give me a thousand and i'll go abroad and i give you my honour as a gentleman i'll not ask him for no more for a year <\s>
<s> give him that message from me strong my boy and tell him if the money ain't here next friday at twelve o'clock as sure as my name's what it is i'll have a paragraph in the newspaper on saturday and next week i'll blow up the whole concern <\s>
<s> strong carried back these words to his principal on whom their effect was such that actually on the day and hour appointed the chevalier made his appearance once more at altamont's hotel at baymouth with the sum of money required <\s>
<s> altamont was a gentleman he said and behaved as such he paid his bill at the inn and the baymouth paper announced his departure on a foreign tour <\s>
<s> strong saw him embark at dover <\s>
<s> it must be forgery at the very least he thought that has put clavering into this fellow's power and the colonel has got the bill <\s>
<s> before the year was out however this happy country saw the colonel once more upon its shores <\s>
<s> a confounded run on the red had finished him he said at baden baden no gentleman could stand against a colour coming up fourteen times <\s>
<s> he had been obliged to draw upon sir francis clavering for means of returning home and clavering though pressed for money for he had election expenses had set up his establishment in the country and was engaged in furnishing his london house yet found means to accept colonel altamont's bill though evidently very much against his will for in strong's hearing sir francis wished to heaven with many curses that the colonel could have been locked up in a debtor's goal in germany for life so that he might never be troubled again <\s>
<s> these sums for the colonel sir francis was obliged to raise without the knowledge of his wife for though perfectly liberal nay sumptuous in her expenditure the good lady had inherited a tolerable aptitude for business along with the large fortune of her father snell and gave to her husband only such a handsome allowance as she thought befitted a gentleman of his rank <\s>
<s> now and again she would give him a present or pay an outstanding gambling debt but she always exacted a pretty accurate account of the moneys so required and respecting the subsidies to the colonel clavering fairly told strong that he couldn't speak to his wife <\s>
<s> strong's business in life was to procure this money and other sums for his patron <\s>
<s> and in the chevalier's apartments in shepherd's inn many negotiations took place between gentlemen of the moneyed world and sir francis clavering and many valuable bank notes and pieces of stamped paper were passed between them <\s>
<s> when a man has been in the habit of getting in debt from his early youth and of exchanging his promises to pay at twelve months against present sums of money it would seem as if no piece of good fortune ever permanently benefited him a little while after the advent of prosperity the money lender is pretty certain to be in the house again and the bills with the old signature in the market <\s>
<s> clavering found it more convenient to see these gentry at strong's lodgings than at his own and such was the chevalier's friendship for the baronet that although he did not possess a shilling of his own his name might be seen as the drawer of almost all the bills of exchange which sir francis clavering accepted <\s>
<s> having drawn clavering's bills he got them discounted in the city <\s>
<s> when they became due he parleyed with the bill holders and gave them instalments of their debt or got time in exchange for fresh acceptances <\s>
<s> regularly or irregularly gentlemen must live somehow and as we read how the other day at comorn the troops forming that garrison were gay and lively acted plays danced at balls and consumed their rations though menaced with an assault from the enemy without the walls and with a gallows if the austrians were successful so there are hundreds of gallant spirits in this town walking about in good spirits dining every day in tolerable gaiety and plenty and going to sleep comfortably with a bailiff always more or less near and a rope of debt round their necks the which trifling inconveniences ned strong the old soldier bore very easily <\s>
<s> but we shall have another opportunity of making acquaintance with these and some other interesting inhabitants of shepherd's inn and in the meanwhile are keeping lady clavering and her friends too long waiting on the door steps of grosvenor place <\s>
<s> first they went into the gorgeous dining room fitted up lady clavering couldn't for goodness gracious tell why in the middle aged style unless said her good natured ladyship laughing because me and clavering are middle aged people and here they were offered the copious remains of the luncheon of which lady clavering and blanche had just partaken <\s>
<s> when nobody was near our little sylphide who scarcely ate at dinner more than the six grains of rice of amina the friend of the ghouls in the arabian nights was most active with her knife and fork and consumed a very substantial portion of mutton cutlets in which piece of hypocrisy it is believed she resembled other young ladies of fashion <\s>
<s> pen and his uncle declined the refection but they admired the dining room with fitting compliments and pronounced it very chaste that being the proper phrase <\s>

<s> in truth strong had long understood sir francis clavering's character as that of a man utterly weak in purpose in principle and intellect a moral and physical trifler and poltroon <\s>
<s> with poor clavering his excellency had had one or two interviews after their baymouth meeting the nature of which conversations the baronet did not confide to strong although he sent letters to altamont by that gentleman who was his ambassador in all sorts of affairs <\s>
<s> on one of these occasions the nawaub's envoy must have been in an exceeding ill humour for he crushed clavering's letter in his hand and said with his own particular manner and emphasis a hundred be hanged <\s>

<s> strong carried back these words to his principal on whom their effect was such that actually on the day and hour appointed the chevalier made his appearance once more at altamont's hotel at baymouth with the sum of money required <\s>
<s> altamont was a gentleman he said and behaved as such he paid his bill at the inn and the baymouth paper announced his departure on a foreign tour <\s>

<s> before the year was out however this happy country saw the colonel once more upon its shores <\s>

<s> he had been obliged to draw upon sir francis clavering for means of returning home and clavering though pressed for money for he had election expenses had set up his establishment in the country and was engaged in furnishing his london house yet found means to accept colonel altamont's bill though evidently very much against his will for in strong's hearing sir francis wished to heaven with many curses that the colonel could have been locked up in a debtor's goal in germany for life so that he might never be troubled again <\s>
<s> these sums for the colonel sir francis was obliged to raise without the knowledge of his wife for though perfectly liberal nay sumptuous in her expenditure the good lady had inherited a tolerable aptitude for business along with the large fortune of her father snell and gave to her husband only such a handsome allowance as she thought befitted a gentleman of his rank <\s>
<s> now and again she would give him a present or pay an outstanding gambling debt but she always exacted a pretty accurate account of the moneys so required and respecting the subsidies to the colonel clavering fairly told strong that he couldn't speak to his wife <\s>

<s> and in the chevalier's apartments in shepherd's inn many negotiations took place between gentlemen of the moneyed world and sir francis clavering and many valuable bank notes and pieces of stamped paper were passed between them <\s>
<s> when a man has been in the habit of getting in debt from his early youth and of exchanging his promises to pay at twelve months against present sums of money it would seem as if no piece of good fortune ever permanently benefited him a little while after the advent of prosperity the money lender is pretty certain to be in the house again and the bills with the old signature in the market <\s>
<s> clavering found it more convenient to see these gentry at strong's lodgings than at his own and such was the chevalier's friendship for the baronet that although he did not possess a shilling of his own his name might be seen as the drawer of almost all the bills of exchange which sir francis clavering accepted <\s>

<s> there were indeed high backed dutch chairs of the seventeenth century there was a sculptured carved buffet of the sixteenth there was a sideboard robbed out of the carved work of a church in the low countries and a large brass cathedral lamp over the round oak table there were old family portraits from wardour street and tapestry from france bits of armour double handed swords and battle axes made of carton pierre looking glasses statuettes of saints and dresden china nothing in a word could be chaster <\s>
<s> behind the dining room was the library fitted with busts and books all of a size and wonderful easy chairs and solemn bronzes in the severe classic style <\s>

<s> but what could equal the chaste splendour of the drawing rooms the carpets were so magnificently fluffy that your foot made no more noise on them than your shadow on their white ground bloomed roses and tulips as big as warming pans about the room were high chairs and low chairs bandy legged chairs chairs so attenuated that it was a wonder any but a sylph could sit upon them marquetterie tables covered with marvellous gimcracks china ornaments of all ages and countries bronzes gilt daggers books of beauty yataghans turkish papooshes and boxes of parisian bonbons <\s>
<s> wherever you sate down there were dresden shepherds and shepherdesses convenient at your elbow there were moreover light blue poodles and ducks and cocks and hens in porcelain there were nymphs by boucher and shepherdesses by greuze very chaste indeed there were muslin curtains and brocade curtains gilt cages with parroquets and love birds two squealing cockatoos each out squealing and out chattering the other a clock singing tunes on a console table and another booming the hours like great tom on the mantelpiece there was in a word everything that comfort could desire and the most elegant taste devise <\s>

<s> indeed as the two gentlemen reached the door a landau drove up a magnificent yellow carriage lined with brocade or satin of a faint cream colour drawn by wonderful grey horses with flaming ribbons and harness blazing all over with crests no less than three of these heraldic emblems surmounted the coats of arms on the panels and these shields contained a prodigious number of quarterings betokening the antiquity and splendour of the house of clavering and snell <\s>
<s> a coachman in a tight silver wig surmounted the magnificent hammer cloth whereon the same arms were worked in bullion and controlled the prancing greys a young man still but of a solemn countenance with a laced waistcoat and buckles in his shoes little buckles unlike those which john and jeames the footmen wear and which we know are large and spread elegantly over the foot <\s>
<s> one of the leaves of the hall door was opened and john one of the largest of his race was leaning against the door pillar with his ambrosial hair powdered his legs crossed beautiful silk stockinged in his hand his cane gold headed dolichoskion <\s>
<s> jeames was invisible but near at hand waiting in the hall with the gentleman who does not wear livery and ready to fling down the roll of hair cloth over which her ladyship was to step to her carriage <\s>
<s> these things and men the which to tell of demands time are seen in the glance of a practised eye and in fact the major and pen had scarcely crossed the street when the second battant of the door flew open the horse hair carpet tumbled down the door steps to those of the carriage john was opening it on one side of the emblazoned door and jeames on the other the two ladies attired in the highest style of fashion and accompanied by a third who carried a blenheim spaniel yelping in a light blue ribbon came forth to ascend the carriage <\s>
<s> miss amory was the first to enter which she did with aerial lightness and took the place which she liked best <\s>
<s> lady clavering next followed but her ladyship was more mature of age and heavy of foot and one of those feet attired in a green satin boot with some part of a stocking which was very fine whatever the ankle might be which it encircled might be seen swaying on the carriage step as her ladyship leaned for support on the arm of the unbending jeames by the enraptured observer of female beauty who happened to be passing at the time of this imposing ceremonial <\s>
<s> the pendennises senior and junior beheld those charms as they came up to the door the major looking grave and courtly and pen somewhat abashed at the carriage and its owners for he thought of sundry little passages at clavering which made his heart beat rather quick <\s>
<s> at that moment lady clavering looking round the pair she was on the first carriage step and would have been in the vehicle in another second but she gave a start backwards which caused some of the powder to fly from the hair of ambrosial jeames and crying out lor if it isn't arthur pendennis and the old major <\s>
<s> jumped back to terra firma directly and holding out two fat hands encased in tight orange coloured gloves the good natured woman warmly greeted the major and his nephew <\s>

<s> we've been waitin and waitin for you ever so long <\s>
<s> come in luncheon ain't gone down cried out this hospitable lady squeezing pen's hand in both hers she had dropped the major's after a brief wrench of recognition and blanche casting up her eyes towards the chimneys descended from the carriage presently with a timid blushing appealing look and gave a little hand to major pendennis <\s>
<s> the companion with the spaniel looked about irresolute and doubting whether she should not take fido his airing but she too turned right about face and entered the house after lady clavering her daughter and the two gentlemen <\s>

<s> in which the sylph reappears better folks than morgan the valet were not so well instructed as that gentleman regarding the amount of lady clavering's riches and the legend in london upon her ladyship's arrival in the polite metropolis was that her fortune was enormous <\s>
<s> indigo factories opium clippers banks overflowing with rupees diamonds and jewels of native princes and vast sums of interest paid by them for loans contracted by themselves or their predecessors to lady clavering's father were mentioned as sources of her wealth <\s>
<s> her account at her london banker's was positively known and the sum embraced so many cyphers as to create as many o's of admiration in the wondering hearer <\s>
<s> it was a known fact that an envoy from an indian prince a colonel altamont the nawaub of lucknow's prime favourite an extraordinary man who had it was said embraced mahometanism and undergone a thousand wild and perilous adventures was at present in this country trying to negotiate with the begum clavering the sale of the nawaub's celebrated nose ring diamond the light of the dewan <\s>
<s> under the title of the begum lady clavering's fame began to spread in london before she herself descended upon the capital and as it has been the boast of delolme and blackstone and all panegyrists of the british constitution that we admit into our aristocracy merit of every kind and that the lowliest born man if he but deserve it may wear the robes of a peer and sit alongside of a cavendish or a stanley so it ought to be the boast of our good society that haughty though it be naturally jealous of its privileges and careful who shall be admitted into its circle yet if an individual be but rich enough all barriers are instantly removed and he or she is welcomed as from his wealth he merits to be <\s>
<s> this fact shows our british independence and honest feeling our higher orders are not such mere haughty aristocrats as the ignorant represent them on the contrary if a man have money they will hold out their hands to him eat his dinners dance at his balls marry his daughters or give their own lovely girls to his sons as affably as your commonest roturier would do <\s>
<s> as he had superintended the arrangements of the country mansion our friend the chevalier strong gave the benefit of his taste and advice to the fashionable london upholsterers who prepared the town house for the reception of the clavering family <\s>
<s> in the decoration of this elegant abode honest strong's soul rejoiced as much as if he had been himself its proprietor <\s>
<s> he hung and re hung the pictures he studied the positions of sofas he had interviews with wine merchants and purveyors who were to supply the new establishment and at the same time the baronet's factotum and confidential friend took the opportunity of furnishing his own chambers and stocking his snug little cellar his friends complimented him upon the neatness of the former and the select guests who came in to share strong's cutlet new found a bottle of excellent claret to accompany the meal <\s>

<s> these things and men the which to tell of demands time are seen in the glance of a practised eye and in fact the major and pen had scarcely crossed the street when the second battant of the door flew open the horse hair carpet tumbled down the door steps to those of the carriage john was opening it on one side of the emblazoned door and jeames on the other the two ladies attired in the highest style of fashion and accompanied by a third who carried a blenheim spaniel yelping in a light blue ribbon came forth to ascend the carriage <\s>
<s> miss amory was the first to enter which she did with aerial lightness and took the place which she liked best <\s>
<s> lady clavering next followed but her ladyship was more mature of age and heavy of foot and one of those feet attired in a green satin boot with some part of a stocking which was very fine whatever the ankle might be which it encircled might be seen swaying on the carriage step as her ladyship leaned for support on the arm of the unbending jeames by the enraptured observer of female beauty who happened to be passing at the time of this imposing ceremonial <\s>
<s> the pendennises senior and junior beheld those charms as they came up to the door the major looking grave and courtly and pen somewhat abashed at the carriage and its owners for he thought of sundry little passages at clavering which made his heart beat rather quick <\s>
<s> at that moment lady clavering looking round the pair she was on the first carriage step and would have been in the vehicle in another second but she gave a start backwards which caused some of the powder to fly from the hair of ambrosial jeames and crying out lor if it isn't arthur pendennis and the old major <\s>
<s> jumped back to terra firma directly and holding out two fat hands encased in tight orange coloured gloves the good natured woman warmly greeted the major and his nephew <\s>
<s> come in both of you why haven't you been before get out blanche and come and see your old friends o i'm so glad to see you <\s>
<s> we've been waitin and waitin for you ever so long <\s>
<s> come in luncheon ain't gone down cried out this hospitable lady squeezing pen's hand in both hers she had dropped the major's after a brief wrench of recognition and blanche casting up her eyes towards the chimneys descended from the carriage presently with a timid blushing appealing look and gave a little hand to major pendennis <\s>
<s> the companion with the spaniel looked about irresolute and doubting whether she should not take fido his airing but she too turned right about face and entered the house after lady clavering her daughter and the two gentlemen <\s>
<s> and the carriage with the prancing greys was left unoccupied save by the coachman in the silver wig <\s>
<s> in which the sylph reappears better folks than morgan the valet were not so well instructed as that gentleman regarding the amount of lady clavering's riches and the legend in london upon her ladyship's arrival in the polite metropolis was that her fortune was enormous <\s>
<s> indigo factories opium clippers banks overflowing with rupees diamonds and jewels of native princes and vast sums of interest paid by them for loans contracted by themselves or their predecessors to lady clavering's father were mentioned as sources of her wealth <\s>
<s> her account at her london banker's was positively known and the sum embraced so many cyphers as to create as many o's of admiration in the wondering hearer <\s>
<s> it was a known fact that an envoy from an indian prince a colonel altamont the nawaub of lucknow's prime favourite an extraordinary man who had it was said embraced mahometanism and undergone a thousand wild and perilous adventures was at present in this country trying to negotiate with the begum clavering the sale of the nawaub's celebrated nose ring diamond the light of the dewan <\s>
<s> under the title of the begum lady clavering's fame began to spread in london before she herself descended upon the capital and as it has been the boast of delolme and blackstone and all panegyrists of the british constitution that we admit into our aristocracy merit of every kind and that the lowliest born man if he but deserve it may wear the robes of a peer and sit alongside of a cavendish or a stanley so it ought to be the boast of our good society that haughty though it be naturally jealous of its privileges and careful who shall be admitted into its circle yet if an individual be but rich enough all barriers are instantly removed and he or she is welcomed as from his wealth he merits to be <\s>
<s> this fact shows our british independence and honest feeling our higher orders are not such mere haughty aristocrats as the ignorant represent them on the contrary if a man have money they will hold out their hands to him eat his dinners dance at his balls marry his daughters or give their own lovely girls to his sons as affably as your commonest roturier would do <\s>
<s> as he had superintended the arrangements of the country mansion our friend the chevalier strong gave the benefit of his taste and advice to the fashionable london upholsterers who prepared the town house for the reception of the clavering family <\s>
<s> in the decoration of this elegant abode honest strong's soul rejoiced as much as if he had been himself its proprietor <\s>
<s> he hung and re hung the pictures he studied the positions of sofas he had interviews with wine merchants and purveyors who were to supply the new establishment and at the same time the baronet's factotum and confidential friend took the opportunity of furnishing his own chambers and stocking his snug little cellar his friends complimented him upon the neatness of the former and the select guests who came in to share strong's cutlet new found a bottle of excellent claret to accompany the meal <\s>
<s> the chevalier was now as he said in clover he had a very comfortable set of rooms in shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> he was waited on by a former spanish legionary and comrade of his whom he had left at a breach of a spanish fort and found at a crossing in tottenham court road and whom he had elevated to the rank of body servant to himself and to the chum who at present shared his lodgings <\s>
<s> this was no other than the favourite of the nawaub of lucknow the valiant colonel altamont <\s>
<s> no man was less curious or at any rate more discreet than ned strong and he did not care to inquire into the mysterious connexion which very soon after their first meeting at baymouth was established between sir francis clavering and the envoy of the nawaub <\s>
<s> the latter knew some secret regarding the former which put clavering into his power somehow and strong who knew that his patron's early life had been rather irregular and that his career with his regiment in india had not been brilliant supposed that the colonel who swore he knew clavering well at calcutta had some hold upon sir francis to which the latter was forced to yield <\s>
<s> in truth strong had long understood sir francis clavering's character as that of a man utterly weak in purpose in principle and intellect a moral and physical trifler and poltroon <\s>
<s> with poor clavering his excellency had had one or two interviews after their baymouth meeting the nature of which conversations the baronet did not confide to strong although he sent letters to altamont by that gentleman who was his ambassador in all sorts of affairs <\s>
<s> on one of these occasions the nawaub's envoy must have been in an exceeding ill humour for he crushed clavering's letter in his hand and said with his own particular manner and emphasis a hundred be hanged <\s>
<s> i'll have no more letters nor no more shilly shally <\s>
<s> tell clavering i'll have a thousand or by jove i'll split and burst him all to atoms <\s>
<s> let him give me a thousand and i'll go abroad and i give you my honour as a gentleman i'll not ask him for no more for a year <\s>
<s> give him that message from me strong my boy and tell him if the money ain't here next friday at twelve o'clock as sure as my name's what it is i'll have a paragraph in the newspaper on saturday and next week i'll blow up the whole concern <\s>
<s> strong carried back these words to his principal on whom their effect was such that actually on the day and hour appointed the chevalier made his appearance once more at altamont's hotel at baymouth with the sum of money required <\s>
<s> altamont was a gentleman he said and behaved as such he paid his bill at the inn and the baymouth paper announced his departure on a foreign tour <\s>
<s> strong saw him embark at dover <\s>
<s> it must be forgery at the very least he thought that has put clavering into this fellow's power and the colonel has got the bill <\s>
<s> before the year was out however this happy country saw the colonel once more upon its shores <\s>
<s> a confounded run on the red had finished him he said at baden baden no gentleman could stand against a colour coming up fourteen times <\s>
<s> he had been obliged to draw upon sir francis clavering for means of returning home and clavering though pressed for money for he had election expenses had set up his establishment in the country and was engaged in furnishing his london house yet found means to accept colonel altamont's bill though evidently very much against his will for in strong's hearing sir francis wished to heaven with many curses that the colonel could have been locked up in a debtor's goal in germany for life so that he might never be troubled again <\s>
<s> these sums for the colonel sir francis was obliged to raise without the knowledge of his wife for though perfectly liberal nay sumptuous in her expenditure the good lady had inherited a tolerable aptitude for business along with the large fortune of her father snell and gave to her husband only such a handsome allowance as she thought befitted a gentleman of his rank <\s>
<s> now and again she would give him a present or pay an outstanding gambling debt but she always exacted a pretty accurate account of the moneys so required and respecting the subsidies to the colonel clavering fairly told strong that he couldn't speak to his wife <\s>
<s> strong's business in life was to procure this money and other sums for his patron <\s>
<s> and in the chevalier's apartments in shepherd's inn many negotiations took place between gentlemen of the moneyed world and sir francis clavering and many valuable bank notes and pieces of stamped paper were passed between them <\s>
<s> when a man has been in the habit of getting in debt from his early youth and of exchanging his promises to pay at twelve months against present sums of money it would seem as if no piece of good fortune ever permanently benefited him a little while after the advent of prosperity the money lender is pretty certain to be in the house again and the bills with the old signature in the market <\s>
<s> clavering found it more convenient to see these gentry at strong's lodgings than at his own and such was the chevalier's friendship for the baronet that although he did not possess a shilling of his own his name might be seen as the drawer of almost all the bills of exchange which sir francis clavering accepted <\s>
<s> having drawn clavering's bills he got them discounted in the city <\s>
<s> when they became due he parleyed with the bill holders and gave them instalments of their debt or got time in exchange for fresh acceptances <\s>
<s> regularly or irregularly gentlemen must live somehow and as we read how the other day at comorn the troops forming that garrison were gay and lively acted plays danced at balls and consumed their rations though menaced with an assault from the enemy without the walls and with a gallows if the austrians were successful so there are hundreds of gallant spirits in this town walking about in good spirits dining every day in tolerable gaiety and plenty and going to sleep comfortably with a bailiff always more or less near and a rope of debt round their necks the which trifling inconveniences ned strong the old soldier bore very easily <\s>
<s> but we shall have another opportunity of making acquaintance with these and some other interesting inhabitants of shepherd's inn and in the meanwhile are keeping lady clavering and her friends too long waiting on the door steps of grosvenor place <\s>
<s> first they went into the gorgeous dining room fitted up lady clavering couldn't for goodness gracious tell why in the middle aged style unless said her good natured ladyship laughing because me and clavering are middle aged people and here they were offered the copious remains of the luncheon of which lady clavering and blanche had just partaken <\s>
<s> when nobody was near our little sylphide who scarcely ate at dinner more than the six grains of rice of amina the friend of the ghouls in the arabian nights was most active with her knife and fork and consumed a very substantial portion of mutton cutlets in which piece of hypocrisy it is believed she resembled other young ladies of fashion <\s>
<s> pen and his uncle declined the refection but they admired the dining room with fitting compliments and pronounced it very chaste that being the proper phrase <\s>
<s> there were indeed high backed dutch chairs of the seventeenth century there was a sculptured carved buffet of the sixteenth there was a sideboard robbed out of the carved work of a church in the low countries and a large brass cathedral lamp over the round oak table there were old family portraits from wardour street and tapestry from france bits of armour double handed swords and battle axes made of carton pierre looking glasses statuettes of saints and dresden china nothing in a word could be chaster <\s>
<s> behind the dining room was the library fitted with busts and books all of a size and wonderful easy chairs and solemn bronzes in the severe classic style <\s>
<s> here it was that guarded by double doors sir francis smoked cigars and read bell's life in london and went to sleep after dinner when he was not smoking over the billiard table at his clubs or punting at the gambling houses in saint james's <\s>
<s> but what could equal the chaste splendour of the drawing rooms the carpets were so magnificently fluffy that your foot made no more noise on them than your shadow on their white ground bloomed roses and tulips as big as warming pans about the room were high chairs and low chairs bandy legged chairs chairs so attenuated that it was a wonder any but a sylph could sit upon them marquetterie tables covered with marvellous gimcracks china ornaments of all ages and countries bronzes gilt daggers books of beauty yataghans turkish papooshes and boxes of parisian bonbons <\s>
<s> wherever you sate down there were dresden shepherds and shepherdesses convenient at your elbow there were moreover light blue poodles and ducks and cocks and hens in porcelain there were nymphs by boucher and shepherdesses by greuze very chaste indeed there were muslin curtains and brocade curtains gilt cages with parroquets and love birds two squealing cockatoos each out squealing and out chattering the other a clock singing tunes on a console table and another booming the hours like great tom on the mantelpiece there was in a word everything that comfort could desire and the most elegant taste devise <\s>
<s> a london drawing room fitted up without regard to expense is surely one of the noblest and most curious sights of the present day <\s>

<s> wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as much five times as much as arthur and with no means at all to pay <\s>

<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>
<s> but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed <\s>
<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>
<s> he saw a party of roaring young blades from oxbridge in the coffee room of his hotel and slunk away from them and paced the streets <\s>
<s> he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermann's window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesn't in the least recollect in what piece <\s>
<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>
<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>
<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>

<s> he is sorry but que voulez vous <\s>
<s> the tooth must be taken out and he has you in the chair and it is surprising with what courage and vigour of wrist he applies the forceps <\s>
<s> perhaps he would not be quite so active or eager if it were his tooth but in fine it is your duty to have it out <\s>
<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>
<s> she had the news already <\s>
<s> she had read pen's letter and it had relieved her somehow <\s>
<s> a gloomy presentiment of evil had been hanging over her for many many months past <\s>
<s> she knew the worst now and her darling boy was come back to her repentant and tender hearted <\s>
<s> did she want more <\s>
<s> all that the rector could say and his remarks were both dictated by common sense and made respectable by antiquity could not bring helen to feel any indignation or particular unhappiness except that the boy should be unhappy <\s>
<s> what was this degree that they made such an outcry about and what good would it do pen <\s>
<s> why did doctor portman and his uncle insist upon sending the boy to a place where there was so much temptation to be risked and so little good to be won <\s>
<s> why didn't they leave him at home with his mother <\s>
<s> as for his debts of course they must be paid his debts wasn't his father's money all his and hadn't he a right to spend it <\s>
<s> in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom <\s>
<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>
<s> coming back from college after an absence from home of some months in place of the simple girl whom he had left behind him mr <\s>
<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>
<s> pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis <\s>
<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>
<s> a pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that <\s>
<s> helen's boy galloping away from home day after day to fall on his knees to an actress and drink with her horrid father <\s>
<s> a good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house and set her over his mother <\s>
<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>

<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>

<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>

<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>

<s> did she want more <\s>

<s> in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom <\s>
<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>

<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>
<s> pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis <\s>
<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>
<s> a pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that <\s>
<s> helen's boy galloping away from home day after day to fall on his knees to an actress and drink with her horrid father <\s>
<s> a good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house and set her over his mother <\s>
<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>

<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>

<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>

<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>

<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>

<s> he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermann's window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesn't in the least recollect in what piece <\s>
<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>
<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>
<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>

<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>
<s> she had the news already <\s>
<s> she had read pen's letter and it had relieved her somehow <\s>
<s> a gloomy presentiment of evil had been hanging over her for many many months past <\s>
<s> she knew the worst now and her darling boy was come back to her repentant and tender hearted <\s>
<s> did she want more <\s>
<s> all that the rector could say and his remarks were both dictated by common sense and made respectable by antiquity could not bring helen to feel any indignation or particular unhappiness except that the boy should be unhappy <\s>
<s> what was this degree that they made such an outcry about and what good would it do pen <\s>
<s> why did doctor portman and his uncle insist upon sending the boy to a place where there was so much temptation to be risked and so little good to be won <\s>
<s> why didn't they leave him at home with his mother <\s>
<s> as for his debts of course they must be paid his debts wasn't his father's money all his and hadn't he a right to spend it <\s>
<s> in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom <\s>
<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>
<s> coming back from college after an absence from home of some months in place of the simple girl whom he had left behind him mr <\s>
<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>
<s> pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis <\s>
<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>
<s> a pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that <\s>
<s> helen's boy galloping away from home day after day to fall on his knees to an actress and drink with her horrid father <\s>
<s> a good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house and set her over his mother <\s>
<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>
<s> in the middle of the night as these two ladies after reading their bibles a great deal during the evening and after taking just a look into pen's room as they passed to their own in the middle of the night i say laura whose head not unfrequently chose to occupy that pillow which the nightcap of the late pendennis had been accustomed to press cried out suddenly mamma are you awake <\s>
<s> and pulling on his hat and trembling in his limbs somewhat major pendennis walked out of his lodgings before his nephew and went ruefully off to take his accustomed corner at the club <\s>

<s> he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephew's debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous <\s>
<s> what was to be done there was nothing for it but to pay <\s>
<s> wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as much five times as much as arthur and with no means at all to pay <\s>

<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>
<s> but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed <\s>
<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>

<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>

<s> a gloomy presentiment of evil had been hanging over her for many many months past <\s>
<s> she knew the worst now and her darling boy was come back to her repentant and tender hearted <\s>
<s> did she want more <\s>
<s> all that the rector could say and his remarks were both dictated by common sense and made respectable by antiquity could not bring helen to feel any indignation or particular unhappiness except that the boy should be unhappy <\s>
<s> what was this degree that they made such an outcry about and what good would it do pen <\s>
<s> why did doctor portman and his uncle insist upon sending the boy to a place where there was so much temptation to be risked and so little good to be won <\s>
<s> why didn't they leave him at home with his mother <\s>
<s> as for his debts of course they must be paid his debts wasn't his father's money all his and hadn't he a right to spend it <\s>
<s> in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom <\s>
<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>
<s> coming back from college after an absence from home of some months in place of the simple girl whom he had left behind him mr <\s>
<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>
<s> pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis <\s>
<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>
<s> a pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that <\s>
<s> helen's boy galloping away from home day after day to fall on his knees to an actress and drink with her horrid father <\s>
<s> a good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house and set her over his mother <\s>
<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>
<s> in the middle of the night as these two ladies after reading their bibles a great deal during the evening and after taking just a look into pen's room as they passed to their own in the middle of the night i say laura whose head not unfrequently chose to occupy that pillow which the nightcap of the late pendennis had been accustomed to press cried out suddenly mamma are you awake <\s>

<s> he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephew's debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous <\s>
<s> what was to be done there was nothing for it but to pay <\s>
<s> wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as much five times as much as arthur and with no means at all to pay <\s>

<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>
<s> but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed <\s>
<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>

<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>
<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>

<s> perhaps he would not be quite so active or eager if it were his tooth but in fine it is your duty to have it out <\s>
<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>
<s> she had the news already <\s>
<s> she had read pen's letter and it had relieved her somehow <\s>
<s> a gloomy presentiment of evil had been hanging over her for many many months past <\s>
<s> she knew the worst now and her darling boy was come back to her repentant and tender hearted <\s>
<s> did she want more <\s>
<s> all that the rector could say and his remarks were both dictated by common sense and made respectable by antiquity could not bring helen to feel any indignation or particular unhappiness except that the boy should be unhappy <\s>
<s> what was this degree that they made such an outcry about and what good would it do pen <\s>
<s> why did doctor portman and his uncle insist upon sending the boy to a place where there was so much temptation to be risked and so little good to be won <\s>
<s> why didn't they leave him at home with his mother <\s>
<s> as for his debts of course they must be paid his debts wasn't his father's money all his and hadn't he a right to spend it <\s>
<s> in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom <\s>
<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>
<s> coming back from college after an absence from home of some months in place of the simple girl whom he had left behind him mr <\s>
<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>
<s> pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis <\s>
<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>
<s> a pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that <\s>
<s> helen's boy galloping away from home day after day to fall on his knees to an actress and drink with her horrid father <\s>
<s> a good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house and set her over his mother <\s>
<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>
<s> in the middle of the night as these two ladies after reading their bibles a great deal during the evening and after taking just a look into pen's room as they passed to their own in the middle of the night i say laura whose head not unfrequently chose to occupy that pillow which the nightcap of the late pendennis had been accustomed to press cried out suddenly mamma are you awake <\s>
<s> and pulling on his hat and trembling in his limbs somewhat major pendennis walked out of his lodgings before his nephew and went ruefully off to take his accustomed corner at the club <\s>

<s> he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephew's debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous <\s>
<s> what was to be done there was nothing for it but to pay <\s>
<s> wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as much five times as much as arthur and with no means at all to pay <\s>
<s> the consultations and calculations and opinions comforted the major somewhat <\s>
<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>
<s> but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed <\s>
<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>

<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>

<s> she had read pen's letter and it had relieved her somehow <\s>
<s> a gloomy presentiment of evil had been hanging over her for many many months past <\s>
<s> she knew the worst now and her darling boy was come back to her repentant and tender hearted <\s>
<s> did she want more <\s>
<s> all that the rector could say and his remarks were both dictated by common sense and made respectable by antiquity could not bring helen to feel any indignation or particular unhappiness except that the boy should be unhappy <\s>
<s> what was this degree that they made such an outcry about and what good would it do pen <\s>
<s> why did doctor portman and his uncle insist upon sending the boy to a place where there was so much temptation to be risked and so little good to be won <\s>
<s> why didn't they leave him at home with his mother <\s>
<s> as for his debts of course they must be paid his debts wasn't his father's money all his and hadn't he a right to spend it <\s>
<s> in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom <\s>
<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>
<s> coming back from college after an absence from home of some months in place of the simple girl whom he had left behind him mr <\s>
<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>
<s> pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis <\s>
<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>
<s> a pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that <\s>
<s> helen's boy galloping away from home day after day to fall on his knees to an actress and drink with her horrid father <\s>
<s> a good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house and set her over his mother <\s>
<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>
<s> in the middle of the night as these two ladies after reading their bibles a great deal during the evening and after taking just a look into pen's room as they passed to their own in the middle of the night i say laura whose head not unfrequently chose to occupy that pillow which the nightcap of the late pendennis had been accustomed to press cried out suddenly mamma are you awake <\s>
<s> and pulling on his hat and trembling in his limbs somewhat major pendennis walked out of his lodgings before his nephew and went ruefully off to take his accustomed corner at the club <\s>

<s> he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephew's debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous <\s>
<s> what was to be done there was nothing for it but to pay <\s>
<s> wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as much five times as much as arthur and with no means at all to pay <\s>
<s> the consultations and calculations and opinions comforted the major somewhat <\s>
<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>
<s> but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed <\s>
<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>

<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>

<s> in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom <\s>
<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>
<s> coming back from college after an absence from home of some months in place of the simple girl whom he had left behind him mr <\s>
<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>
<s> pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis <\s>
<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>
<s> a pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that <\s>
<s> helen's boy galloping away from home day after day to fall on his knees to an actress and drink with her horrid father <\s>
<s> a good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house and set her over his mother <\s>
<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>
<s> in the middle of the night as these two ladies after reading their bibles a great deal during the evening and after taking just a look into pen's room as they passed to their own in the middle of the night i say laura whose head not unfrequently chose to occupy that pillow which the nightcap of the late pendennis had been accustomed to press cried out suddenly mamma are you awake <\s>

<s> he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephew's debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous <\s>
<s> what was to be done there was nothing for it but to pay <\s>
<s> wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as much five times as much as arthur and with no means at all to pay <\s>
<s> the consultations and calculations and opinions comforted the major somewhat <\s>
<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>
<s> but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed <\s>
<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>

<s> he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermann's window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesn't in the least recollect in what piece <\s>
<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>

<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>

<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>
<s> pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis <\s>
<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>
<s> a pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that <\s>
<s> helen's boy galloping away from home day after day to fall on his knees to an actress and drink with her horrid father <\s>
<s> a good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house and set her over his mother <\s>
<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>
<s> in the middle of the night as these two ladies after reading their bibles a great deal during the evening and after taking just a look into pen's room as they passed to their own in the middle of the night i say laura whose head not unfrequently chose to occupy that pillow which the nightcap of the late pendennis had been accustomed to press cried out suddenly mamma are you awake <\s>
<s> and pulling on his hat and trembling in his limbs somewhat major pendennis walked out of his lodgings before his nephew and went ruefully off to take his accustomed corner at the club <\s>
<s> he saw the oxbridge examination lists in the morning papers and read over the names not understanding the business with mournful accuracy <\s>
<s> he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephew's debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous <\s>
<s> what was to be done there was nothing for it but to pay <\s>
<s> wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as much five times as much as arthur and with no means at all to pay <\s>
<s> the consultations and calculations and opinions comforted the major somewhat <\s>
<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>
<s> but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed <\s>
<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>
<s> he saw a party of roaring young blades from oxbridge in the coffee room of his hotel and slunk away from them and paced the streets <\s>
<s> he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermann's window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesn't in the least recollect in what piece <\s>
<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>
<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>
<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>
<s> he wishes the deed were done and done quickly <\s>
<s> he is sorry but que voulez vous <\s>
<s> the tooth must be taken out and he has you in the chair and it is surprising with what courage and vigour of wrist he applies the forceps <\s>
<s> perhaps he would not be quite so active or eager if it were his tooth but in fine it is your duty to have it out <\s>
<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>

<s> in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom <\s>

<s> coming back from college after an absence from home of some months in place of the simple girl whom he had left behind him mr <\s>
<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>
<s> pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis <\s>
<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>
<s> a pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that <\s>
<s> helen's boy galloping away from home day after day to fall on his knees to an actress and drink with her horrid father <\s>
<s> a good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house and set her over his mother <\s>
<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>
<s> in the middle of the night as these two ladies after reading their bibles a great deal during the evening and after taking just a look into pen's room as they passed to their own in the middle of the night i say laura whose head not unfrequently chose to occupy that pillow which the nightcap of the late pendennis had been accustomed to press cried out suddenly mamma are you awake <\s>
<s> and pulling on his hat and trembling in his limbs somewhat major pendennis walked out of his lodgings before his nephew and went ruefully off to take his accustomed corner at the club <\s>
<s> he saw the oxbridge examination lists in the morning papers and read over the names not understanding the business with mournful accuracy <\s>
<s> he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephew's debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous <\s>
<s> what was to be done there was nothing for it but to pay <\s>
<s> wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as much five times as much as arthur and with no means at all to pay <\s>
<s> the consultations and calculations and opinions comforted the major somewhat <\s>
<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>
<s> but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed <\s>
<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>
<s> he saw a party of roaring young blades from oxbridge in the coffee room of his hotel and slunk away from them and paced the streets <\s>
<s> he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermann's window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesn't in the least recollect in what piece <\s>
<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>
<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>
<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>
<s> he wishes the deed were done and done quickly <\s>
<s> he is sorry but que voulez vous <\s>
<s> the tooth must be taken out and he has you in the chair and it is surprising with what courage and vigour of wrist he applies the forceps <\s>
<s> perhaps he would not be quite so active or eager if it were his tooth but in fine it is your duty to have it out <\s>
<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>

<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>
<s> pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis <\s>
<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>

<s> helen's boy galloping away from home day after day to fall on his knees to an actress and drink with her horrid father <\s>
<s> a good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house and set her over his mother <\s>
<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>
<s> in the middle of the night as these two ladies after reading their bibles a great deal during the evening and after taking just a look into pen's room as they passed to their own in the middle of the night i say laura whose head not unfrequently chose to occupy that pillow which the nightcap of the late pendennis had been accustomed to press cried out suddenly mamma are you awake <\s>
<s> and pulling on his hat and trembling in his limbs somewhat major pendennis walked out of his lodgings before his nephew and went ruefully off to take his accustomed corner at the club <\s>
<s> he saw the oxbridge examination lists in the morning papers and read over the names not understanding the business with mournful accuracy <\s>
<s> he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephew's debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous <\s>
<s> what was to be done there was nothing for it but to pay <\s>
<s> wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as much five times as much as arthur and with no means at all to pay <\s>
<s> the consultations and calculations and opinions comforted the major somewhat <\s>
<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>
<s> but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed <\s>
<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>
<s> he saw a party of roaring young blades from oxbridge in the coffee room of his hotel and slunk away from them and paced the streets <\s>
<s> he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermann's window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesn't in the least recollect in what piece <\s>
<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>
<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>
<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>
<s> he wishes the deed were done and done quickly <\s>
<s> he is sorry but que voulez vous <\s>
<s> the tooth must be taken out and he has you in the chair and it is surprising with what courage and vigour of wrist he applies the forceps <\s>
<s> perhaps he would not be quite so active or eager if it were his tooth but in fine it is your duty to have it out <\s>
<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>

<s> did she want more <\s>
<s> all that the rector could say and his remarks were both dictated by common sense and made respectable by antiquity could not bring helen to feel any indignation or particular unhappiness except that the boy should be unhappy <\s>
<s> what was this degree that they made such an outcry about and what good would it do pen <\s>
<s> why did doctor portman and his uncle insist upon sending the boy to a place where there was so much temptation to be risked and so little good to be won <\s>
<s> why didn't they leave him at home with his mother <\s>
<s> as for his debts of course they must be paid his debts wasn't his father's money all his and hadn't he a right to spend it <\s>

<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>
<s> pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis <\s>
<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>
<s> a pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that <\s>
<s> helen's boy galloping away from home day after day to fall on his knees to an actress and drink with her horrid father <\s>
<s> a good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house and set her over his mother <\s>
<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>
<s> in the middle of the night as these two ladies after reading their bibles a great deal during the evening and after taking just a look into pen's room as they passed to their own in the middle of the night i say laura whose head not unfrequently chose to occupy that pillow which the nightcap of the late pendennis had been accustomed to press cried out suddenly mamma are you awake <\s>
<s> and pulling on his hat and trembling in his limbs somewhat major pendennis walked out of his lodgings before his nephew and went ruefully off to take his accustomed corner at the club <\s>
<s> he saw the oxbridge examination lists in the morning papers and read over the names not understanding the business with mournful accuracy <\s>
<s> he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephew's debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous <\s>
<s> what was to be done there was nothing for it but to pay <\s>
<s> wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as much five times as much as arthur and with no means at all to pay <\s>
<s> the consultations and calculations and opinions comforted the major somewhat <\s>
<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>
<s> but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed <\s>
<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>
<s> he saw a party of roaring young blades from oxbridge in the coffee room of his hotel and slunk away from them and paced the streets <\s>
<s> he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermann's window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesn't in the least recollect in what piece <\s>
<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>
<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>
<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>
<s> he wishes the deed were done and done quickly <\s>
<s> he is sorry but que voulez vous <\s>
<s> the tooth must be taken out and he has you in the chair and it is surprising with what courage and vigour of wrist he applies the forceps <\s>
<s> perhaps he would not be quite so active or eager if it were his tooth but in fine it is your duty to have it out <\s>
<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>
<s> she had the news already <\s>
<s> she had read pen's letter and it had relieved her somehow <\s>
<s> a gloomy presentiment of evil had been hanging over her for many many months past <\s>
<s> she knew the worst now and her darling boy was come back to her repentant and tender hearted <\s>
<s> did she want more <\s>
<s> all that the rector could say and his remarks were both dictated by common sense and made respectable by antiquity could not bring helen to feel any indignation or particular unhappiness except that the boy should be unhappy <\s>
<s> what was this degree that they made such an outcry about and what good would it do pen <\s>
<s> why did doctor portman and his uncle insist upon sending the boy to a place where there was so much temptation to be risked and so little good to be won <\s>
<s> why didn't they leave him at home with his mother <\s>
<s> as for his debts of course they must be paid his debts wasn't his father's money all his and hadn't he a right to spend it <\s>
<s> in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom <\s>
<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>

<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>
<s> pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis <\s>
<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>
<s> a pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that <\s>
<s> helen's boy galloping away from home day after day to fall on his knees to an actress and drink with her horrid father <\s>
<s> a good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house and set her over his mother <\s>
<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>
<s> in the middle of the night as these two ladies after reading their bibles a great deal during the evening and after taking just a look into pen's room as they passed to their own in the middle of the night i say laura whose head not unfrequently chose to occupy that pillow which the nightcap of the late pendennis had been accustomed to press cried out suddenly mamma are you awake <\s>
<s> and pulling on his hat and trembling in his limbs somewhat major pendennis walked out of his lodgings before his nephew and went ruefully off to take his accustomed corner at the club <\s>
<s> he saw the oxbridge examination lists in the morning papers and read over the names not understanding the business with mournful accuracy <\s>
<s> he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephew's debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous <\s>
<s> what was to be done there was nothing for it but to pay <\s>
<s> wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as much five times as much as arthur and with no means at all to pay <\s>
<s> the consultations and calculations and opinions comforted the major somewhat <\s>
<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>
<s> but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed <\s>
<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>
<s> he saw a party of roaring young blades from oxbridge in the coffee room of his hotel and slunk away from them and paced the streets <\s>
<s> he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermann's window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesn't in the least recollect in what piece <\s>
<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>
<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>
<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>
<s> he wishes the deed were done and done quickly <\s>
<s> he is sorry but que voulez vous <\s>
<s> the tooth must be taken out and he has you in the chair and it is surprising with what courage and vigour of wrist he applies the forceps <\s>
<s> perhaps he would not be quite so active or eager if it were his tooth but in fine it is your duty to have it out <\s>
<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>
<s> she had the news already <\s>

<s> a gloomy presentiment of evil had been hanging over her for many many months past <\s>
<s> she knew the worst now and her darling boy was come back to her repentant and tender hearted <\s>
<s> did she want more <\s>
<s> all that the rector could say and his remarks were both dictated by common sense and made respectable by antiquity could not bring helen to feel any indignation or particular unhappiness except that the boy should be unhappy <\s>
<s> what was this degree that they made such an outcry about and what good would it do pen <\s>
<s> why did doctor portman and his uncle insist upon sending the boy to a place where there was so much temptation to be risked and so little good to be won <\s>
<s> why didn't they leave him at home with his mother <\s>
<s> as for his debts of course they must be paid his debts wasn't his father's money all his and hadn't he a right to spend it <\s>
<s> in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom <\s>
<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>

<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>

<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>

<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>

<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>

<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>

<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>
<s> in the middle of the night as these two ladies after reading their bibles a great deal during the evening and after taking just a look into pen's room as they passed to their own in the middle of the night i say laura whose head not unfrequently chose to occupy that pillow which the nightcap of the late pendennis had been accustomed to press cried out suddenly mamma are you awake <\s>
<s> and pulling on his hat and trembling in his limbs somewhat major pendennis walked out of his lodgings before his nephew and went ruefully off to take his accustomed corner at the club <\s>

<s> he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephew's debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous <\s>
<s> what was to be done there was nothing for it but to pay <\s>
<s> wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as much five times as much as arthur and with no means at all to pay <\s>
<s> the consultations and calculations and opinions comforted the major somewhat <\s>
<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>
<s> but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed <\s>
<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>
<s> he saw a party of roaring young blades from oxbridge in the coffee room of his hotel and slunk away from them and paced the streets <\s>
<s> he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermann's window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesn't in the least recollect in what piece <\s>
<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>
<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>
<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>

<s> he is sorry but que voulez vous <\s>
<s> the tooth must be taken out and he has you in the chair and it is surprising with what courage and vigour of wrist he applies the forceps <\s>
<s> perhaps he would not be quite so active or eager if it were his tooth but in fine it is your duty to have it out <\s>
<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>

<s> as for his debts of course they must be paid his debts wasn't his father's money all his and hadn't he a right to spend it <\s>

<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>

<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>

<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>

<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>

<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>

<s> he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephew's debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous <\s>

<s> wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as much five times as much as arthur and with no means at all to pay <\s>

<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>

<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>

<s> he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermann's window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesn't in the least recollect in what piece <\s>
<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>
<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>
<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>

<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>

<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>

<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>

<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>

<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>

<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>

<s> he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephew's debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous <\s>
<s> what was to be done there was nothing for it but to pay <\s>
<s> wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as much five times as much as arthur and with no means at all to pay <\s>

<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>
<s> but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed <\s>
<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>
<s> he saw a party of roaring young blades from oxbridge in the coffee room of his hotel and slunk away from them and paced the streets <\s>
<s> he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermann's window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesn't in the least recollect in what piece <\s>
<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>
<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>
<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>

<s> the tooth must be taken out and he has you in the chair and it is surprising with what courage and vigour of wrist he applies the forceps <\s>
<s> perhaps he would not be quite so active or eager if it were his tooth but in fine it is your duty to have it out <\s>
<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>

<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>

<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>

<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>

<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>

<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>
<s> in the middle of the night as these two ladies after reading their bibles a great deal during the evening and after taking just a look into pen's room as they passed to their own in the middle of the night i say laura whose head not unfrequently chose to occupy that pillow which the nightcap of the late pendennis had been accustomed to press cried out suddenly mamma are you awake <\s>
<s> and pulling on his hat and trembling in his limbs somewhat major pendennis walked out of his lodgings before his nephew and went ruefully off to take his accustomed corner at the club <\s>

<s> he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephew's debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous <\s>
<s> what was to be done there was nothing for it but to pay <\s>
<s> wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as much five times as much as arthur and with no means at all to pay <\s>
<s> the consultations and calculations and opinions comforted the major somewhat <\s>
<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>
<s> but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed <\s>
<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>
<s> he saw a party of roaring young blades from oxbridge in the coffee room of his hotel and slunk away from them and paced the streets <\s>
<s> he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermann's window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesn't in the least recollect in what piece <\s>
<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>
<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>
<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>
<s> he wishes the deed were done and done quickly <\s>
<s> he is sorry but que voulez vous <\s>
<s> the tooth must be taken out and he has you in the chair and it is surprising with what courage and vigour of wrist he applies the forceps <\s>
<s> perhaps he would not be quite so active or eager if it were his tooth but in fine it is your duty to have it out <\s>
<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>

<s> did she want more <\s>
<s> all that the rector could say and his remarks were both dictated by common sense and made respectable by antiquity could not bring helen to feel any indignation or particular unhappiness except that the boy should be unhappy <\s>
<s> what was this degree that they made such an outcry about and what good would it do pen <\s>
<s> why did doctor portman and his uncle insist upon sending the boy to a place where there was so much temptation to be risked and so little good to be won <\s>
<s> why didn't they leave him at home with his mother <\s>
<s> as for his debts of course they must be paid his debts wasn't his father's money all his and hadn't he a right to spend it <\s>
<s> in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom <\s>
<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>
<s> coming back from college after an absence from home of some months in place of the simple girl whom he had left behind him mr <\s>
<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>

<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>

<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>
<s> in the middle of the night as these two ladies after reading their bibles a great deal during the evening and after taking just a look into pen's room as they passed to their own in the middle of the night i say laura whose head not unfrequently chose to occupy that pillow which the nightcap of the late pendennis had been accustomed to press cried out suddenly mamma are you awake <\s>
<s> and pulling on his hat and trembling in his limbs somewhat major pendennis walked out of his lodgings before his nephew and went ruefully off to take his accustomed corner at the club <\s>
<s> he saw the oxbridge examination lists in the morning papers and read over the names not understanding the business with mournful accuracy <\s>
<s> he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephew's debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous <\s>
<s> what was to be done there was nothing for it but to pay <\s>
<s> wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as much five times as much as arthur and with no means at all to pay <\s>
<s> the consultations and calculations and opinions comforted the major somewhat <\s>
<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>
<s> but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed <\s>
<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>
<s> he saw a party of roaring young blades from oxbridge in the coffee room of his hotel and slunk away from them and paced the streets <\s>
<s> he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermann's window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesn't in the least recollect in what piece <\s>
<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>
<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>
<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>
<s> he wishes the deed were done and done quickly <\s>
<s> he is sorry but que voulez vous <\s>
<s> the tooth must be taken out and he has you in the chair and it is surprising with what courage and vigour of wrist he applies the forceps <\s>
<s> perhaps he would not be quite so active or eager if it were his tooth but in fine it is your duty to have it out <\s>
<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>

<s> did she want more <\s>
<s> all that the rector could say and his remarks were both dictated by common sense and made respectable by antiquity could not bring helen to feel any indignation or particular unhappiness except that the boy should be unhappy <\s>
<s> what was this degree that they made such an outcry about and what good would it do pen <\s>
<s> why did doctor portman and his uncle insist upon sending the boy to a place where there was so much temptation to be risked and so little good to be won <\s>
<s> why didn't they leave him at home with his mother <\s>
<s> as for his debts of course they must be paid his debts wasn't his father's money all his and hadn't he a right to spend it <\s>
<s> in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom <\s>
<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>
<s> coming back from college after an absence from home of some months in place of the simple girl whom he had left behind him mr <\s>
<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>

<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>
<s> a pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that <\s>

<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>
<s> in the middle of the night as these two ladies after reading their bibles a great deal during the evening and after taking just a look into pen's room as they passed to their own in the middle of the night i say laura whose head not unfrequently chose to occupy that pillow which the nightcap of the late pendennis had been accustomed to press cried out suddenly mamma are you awake <\s>
<s> and pulling on his hat and trembling in his limbs somewhat major pendennis walked out of his lodgings before his nephew and went ruefully off to take his accustomed corner at the club <\s>
<s> he saw the oxbridge examination lists in the morning papers and read over the names not understanding the business with mournful accuracy <\s>
<s> he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephew's debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous <\s>
<s> what was to be done there was nothing for it but to pay <\s>
<s> wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as much five times as much as arthur and with no means at all to pay <\s>
<s> the consultations and calculations and opinions comforted the major somewhat <\s>
<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>
<s> but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed <\s>
<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>
<s> he saw a party of roaring young blades from oxbridge in the coffee room of his hotel and slunk away from them and paced the streets <\s>
<s> he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermann's window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesn't in the least recollect in what piece <\s>
<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>
<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>
<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>
<s> he wishes the deed were done and done quickly <\s>
<s> he is sorry but que voulez vous <\s>
<s> the tooth must be taken out and he has you in the chair and it is surprising with what courage and vigour of wrist he applies the forceps <\s>
<s> perhaps he would not be quite so active or eager if it were his tooth but in fine it is your duty to have it out <\s>
<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>

<s> she knew the worst now and her darling boy was come back to her repentant and tender hearted <\s>
<s> did she want more <\s>
<s> all that the rector could say and his remarks were both dictated by common sense and made respectable by antiquity could not bring helen to feel any indignation or particular unhappiness except that the boy should be unhappy <\s>
<s> what was this degree that they made such an outcry about and what good would it do pen <\s>
<s> why did doctor portman and his uncle insist upon sending the boy to a place where there was so much temptation to be risked and so little good to be won <\s>
<s> why didn't they leave him at home with his mother <\s>
<s> as for his debts of course they must be paid his debts wasn't his father's money all his and hadn't he a right to spend it <\s>
<s> in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom <\s>
<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>
<s> coming back from college after an absence from home of some months in place of the simple girl whom he had left behind him mr <\s>
<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>

<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>
<s> a pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that <\s>
<s> helen's boy galloping away from home day after day to fall on his knees to an actress and drink with her horrid father <\s>
<s> a good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house and set her over his mother <\s>
<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>
<s> in the middle of the night as these two ladies after reading their bibles a great deal during the evening and after taking just a look into pen's room as they passed to their own in the middle of the night i say laura whose head not unfrequently chose to occupy that pillow which the nightcap of the late pendennis had been accustomed to press cried out suddenly mamma are you awake <\s>
<s> and pulling on his hat and trembling in his limbs somewhat major pendennis walked out of his lodgings before his nephew and went ruefully off to take his accustomed corner at the club <\s>
<s> he saw the oxbridge examination lists in the morning papers and read over the names not understanding the business with mournful accuracy <\s>
<s> he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephew's debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous <\s>
<s> what was to be done there was nothing for it but to pay <\s>
<s> wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as much five times as much as arthur and with no means at all to pay <\s>
<s> the consultations and calculations and opinions comforted the major somewhat <\s>
<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>
<s> but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed <\s>
<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>
<s> he saw a party of roaring young blades from oxbridge in the coffee room of his hotel and slunk away from them and paced the streets <\s>
<s> he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermann's window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesn't in the least recollect in what piece <\s>
<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>
<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>
<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>
<s> he wishes the deed were done and done quickly <\s>
<s> he is sorry but que voulez vous <\s>
<s> the tooth must be taken out and he has you in the chair and it is surprising with what courage and vigour of wrist he applies the forceps <\s>
<s> perhaps he would not be quite so active or eager if it were his tooth but in fine it is your duty to have it out <\s>
<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>
<s> she had the news already <\s>

<s> a gloomy presentiment of evil had been hanging over her for many many months past <\s>
<s> she knew the worst now and her darling boy was come back to her repentant and tender hearted <\s>
<s> did she want more <\s>
<s> all that the rector could say and his remarks were both dictated by common sense and made respectable by antiquity could not bring helen to feel any indignation or particular unhappiness except that the boy should be unhappy <\s>
<s> what was this degree that they made such an outcry about and what good would it do pen <\s>
<s> why did doctor portman and his uncle insist upon sending the boy to a place where there was so much temptation to be risked and so little good to be won <\s>
<s> why didn't they leave him at home with his mother <\s>
<s> as for his debts of course they must be paid his debts wasn't his father's money all his and hadn't he a right to spend it <\s>
<s> in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom <\s>
<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>
<s> coming back from college after an absence from home of some months in place of the simple girl whom he had left behind him mr <\s>
<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>

<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>

<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>

<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>

<s> he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermann's window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesn't in the least recollect in what piece <\s>
<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>
<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>
<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>

<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>

<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>

<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>

<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>

<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>

<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>
<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>
<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>

<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>

<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>

<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>

<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>

<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>

<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>

<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>

<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>

<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>
<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>
<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>

<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>

<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>

<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>

<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>

<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>

<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>

<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>

<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>

<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>

<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>

<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>

<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>

<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>

<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>

<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>

<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>

<s> he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephew's debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous <\s>

<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>
<s> but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed <\s>
<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>

<s> he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermann's window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesn't in the least recollect in what piece <\s>
<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>
<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>
<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>

<s> the tooth must be taken out and he has you in the chair and it is surprising with what courage and vigour of wrist he applies the forceps <\s>

<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>

<s> did she want more <\s>

<s> what was this degree that they made such an outcry about and what good would it do pen <\s>
<s> why did doctor portman and his uncle insist upon sending the boy to a place where there was so much temptation to be risked and so little good to be won <\s>
<s> why didn't they leave him at home with his mother <\s>
<s> as for his debts of course they must be paid his debts wasn't his father's money all his and hadn't he a right to spend it <\s>
<s> in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom <\s>
<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>
<s> coming back from college after an absence from home of some months in place of the simple girl whom he had left behind him mr <\s>
<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>

<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>

<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>

<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>

<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>

<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>

<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>

<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>

<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>

<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>

<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>

<s> as for his debts of course they must be paid his debts wasn't his father's money all his and hadn't he a right to spend it <\s>
<s> in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom <\s>
<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>

<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>

<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>

<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>

<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>

<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>

<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>

<s> he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephew's debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous <\s>

<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>

<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>

<s> he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermann's window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesn't in the least recollect in what piece <\s>
<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>

<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>

<s> as for his debts of course they must be paid his debts wasn't his father's money all his and hadn't he a right to spend it <\s>
<s> in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom <\s>
<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>

<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>
<s> pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis <\s>
<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>

<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>

<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>

<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>

<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>

<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>

<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>

<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>

<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>

<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>

<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>

<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>

<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>

<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>

<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>

<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>

<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>

<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>

<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>

<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>

<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>

<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>

<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>

<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>

<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>

<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>

<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>

<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>

<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>

<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>

<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>

<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>

<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>

<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>

<s> he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermann's window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesn't in the least recollect in what piece <\s>
<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>
<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>
<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>

<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>

<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>

<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>
<s> pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis <\s>
<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>

<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>

<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>

<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>

<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>

<s> he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermann's window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesn't in the least recollect in what piece <\s>
<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>
<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>

<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>

<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>

<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>
<s> pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis <\s>
<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>
<s> a pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that <\s>
<s> helen's boy galloping away from home day after day to fall on his knees to an actress and drink with her horrid father <\s>
<s> a good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house and set her over his mother <\s>
<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>

<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>

<s> he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermann's window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesn't in the least recollect in what piece <\s>
<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>
<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>

<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>

<s> why did doctor portman and his uncle insist upon sending the boy to a place where there was so much temptation to be risked and so little good to be won <\s>

<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>

<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>
<s> pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis <\s>
<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>
<s> a pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that <\s>
<s> helen's boy galloping away from home day after day to fall on his knees to an actress and drink with her horrid father <\s>
<s> a good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house and set her over his mother <\s>
<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>

<s> wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as much five times as much as arthur and with no means at all to pay <\s>

<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>
<s> but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed <\s>
<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>
<s> he saw a party of roaring young blades from oxbridge in the coffee room of his hotel and slunk away from them and paced the streets <\s>
<s> he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermann's window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesn't in the least recollect in what piece <\s>
<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>
<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>
<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>

<s> he is sorry but que voulez vous <\s>
<s> the tooth must be taken out and he has you in the chair and it is surprising with what courage and vigour of wrist he applies the forceps <\s>
<s> perhaps he would not be quite so active or eager if it were his tooth but in fine it is your duty to have it out <\s>
<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>
<s> she had the news already <\s>
<s> she had read pen's letter and it had relieved her somehow <\s>
<s> a gloomy presentiment of evil had been hanging over her for many many months past <\s>
<s> she knew the worst now and her darling boy was come back to her repentant and tender hearted <\s>
<s> did she want more <\s>
<s> all that the rector could say and his remarks were both dictated by common sense and made respectable by antiquity could not bring helen to feel any indignation or particular unhappiness except that the boy should be unhappy <\s>
<s> what was this degree that they made such an outcry about and what good would it do pen <\s>
<s> why did doctor portman and his uncle insist upon sending the boy to a place where there was so much temptation to be risked and so little good to be won <\s>
<s> why didn't they leave him at home with his mother <\s>
<s> as for his debts of course they must be paid his debts wasn't his father's money all his and hadn't he a right to spend it <\s>
<s> in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom <\s>
<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>
<s> coming back from college after an absence from home of some months in place of the simple girl whom he had left behind him mr <\s>
<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>
<s> pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis <\s>
<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>
<s> a pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that <\s>
<s> helen's boy galloping away from home day after day to fall on his knees to an actress and drink with her horrid father <\s>
<s> a good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house and set her over his mother <\s>
<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>

<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>

<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>

<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>

<s> did she want more <\s>

<s> in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom <\s>
<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>

<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>
<s> pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis <\s>
<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>
<s> a pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that <\s>
<s> helen's boy galloping away from home day after day to fall on his knees to an actress and drink with her horrid father <\s>
<s> a good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house and set her over his mother <\s>
<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>

<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>

<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>

<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>

<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>

<s> he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermann's window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesn't in the least recollect in what piece <\s>
<s> on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a month's application <\s>
<s> he said he had ordered pen's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman's wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pen's bills laid on the top <\s>
<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>
<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>

<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>
<s> she had the news already <\s>
<s> she had read pen's letter and it had relieved her somehow <\s>
<s> a gloomy presentiment of evil had been hanging over her for many many months past <\s>
<s> she knew the worst now and her darling boy was come back to her repentant and tender hearted <\s>
<s> did she want more <\s>
<s> all that the rector could say and his remarks were both dictated by common sense and made respectable by antiquity could not bring helen to feel any indignation or particular unhappiness except that the boy should be unhappy <\s>
<s> what was this degree that they made such an outcry about and what good would it do pen <\s>
<s> why did doctor portman and his uncle insist upon sending the boy to a place where there was so much temptation to be risked and so little good to be won <\s>
<s> why didn't they leave him at home with his mother <\s>
<s> as for his debts of course they must be paid his debts wasn't his father's money all his and hadn't he a right to spend it <\s>
<s> in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom <\s>
<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>
<s> coming back from college after an absence from home of some months in place of the simple girl whom he had left behind him mr <\s>
<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>
<s> pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis <\s>
<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>
<s> a pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that <\s>
<s> helen's boy galloping away from home day after day to fall on his knees to an actress and drink with her horrid father <\s>
<s> a good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house and set her over his mother <\s>
<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>
<s> in the middle of the night as these two ladies after reading their bibles a great deal during the evening and after taking just a look into pen's room as they passed to their own in the middle of the night i say laura whose head not unfrequently chose to occupy that pillow which the nightcap of the late pendennis had been accustomed to press cried out suddenly mamma are you awake <\s>
<s> and pulling on his hat and trembling in his limbs somewhat major pendennis walked out of his lodgings before his nephew and went ruefully off to take his accustomed corner at the club <\s>

<s> he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephew's debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous <\s>
<s> what was to be done there was nothing for it but to pay <\s>
<s> wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as much five times as much as arthur and with no means at all to pay <\s>

<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>
<s> but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed <\s>
<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>

<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>

<s> a gloomy presentiment of evil had been hanging over her for many many months past <\s>
<s> she knew the worst now and her darling boy was come back to her repentant and tender hearted <\s>
<s> did she want more <\s>
<s> all that the rector could say and his remarks were both dictated by common sense and made respectable by antiquity could not bring helen to feel any indignation or particular unhappiness except that the boy should be unhappy <\s>
<s> what was this degree that they made such an outcry about and what good would it do pen <\s>
<s> why did doctor portman and his uncle insist upon sending the boy to a place where there was so much temptation to be risked and so little good to be won <\s>
<s> why didn't they leave him at home with his mother <\s>
<s> as for his debts of course they must be paid his debts wasn't his father's money all his and hadn't he a right to spend it <\s>
<s> in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom <\s>
<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>
<s> coming back from college after an absence from home of some months in place of the simple girl whom he had left behind him mr <\s>
<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>
<s> pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis <\s>
<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>
<s> a pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that <\s>
<s> helen's boy galloping away from home day after day to fall on his knees to an actress and drink with her horrid father <\s>
<s> a good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house and set her over his mother <\s>
<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>
<s> in the middle of the night as these two ladies after reading their bibles a great deal during the evening and after taking just a look into pen's room as they passed to their own in the middle of the night i say laura whose head not unfrequently chose to occupy that pillow which the nightcap of the late pendennis had been accustomed to press cried out suddenly mamma are you awake <\s>

<s> he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephew's debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous <\s>
<s> what was to be done there was nothing for it but to pay <\s>
<s> wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as much five times as much as arthur and with no means at all to pay <\s>

<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>
<s> but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed <\s>
<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>

<s> on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening <\s>
<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>

<s> perhaps he would not be quite so active or eager if it were his tooth but in fine it is your duty to have it out <\s>
<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>
<s> she had the news already <\s>
<s> she had read pen's letter and it had relieved her somehow <\s>
<s> a gloomy presentiment of evil had been hanging over her for many many months past <\s>
<s> she knew the worst now and her darling boy was come back to her repentant and tender hearted <\s>
<s> did she want more <\s>
<s> all that the rector could say and his remarks were both dictated by common sense and made respectable by antiquity could not bring helen to feel any indignation or particular unhappiness except that the boy should be unhappy <\s>
<s> what was this degree that they made such an outcry about and what good would it do pen <\s>
<s> why did doctor portman and his uncle insist upon sending the boy to a place where there was so much temptation to be risked and so little good to be won <\s>
<s> why didn't they leave him at home with his mother <\s>
<s> as for his debts of course they must be paid his debts wasn't his father's money all his and hadn't he a right to spend it <\s>
<s> in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom <\s>
<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>
<s> coming back from college after an absence from home of some months in place of the simple girl whom he had left behind him mr <\s>
<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>
<s> pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis <\s>
<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>
<s> a pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that <\s>
<s> helen's boy galloping away from home day after day to fall on his knees to an actress and drink with her horrid father <\s>
<s> a good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house and set her over his mother <\s>
<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>
<s> in the middle of the night as these two ladies after reading their bibles a great deal during the evening and after taking just a look into pen's room as they passed to their own in the middle of the night i say laura whose head not unfrequently chose to occupy that pillow which the nightcap of the late pendennis had been accustomed to press cried out suddenly mamma are you awake <\s>
<s> and pulling on his hat and trembling in his limbs somewhat major pendennis walked out of his lodgings before his nephew and went ruefully off to take his accustomed corner at the club <\s>

<s> he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephew's debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous <\s>
<s> what was to be done there was nothing for it but to pay <\s>
<s> wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as much five times as much as arthur and with no means at all to pay <\s>
<s> the consultations and calculations and opinions comforted the major somewhat <\s>
<s> after all he was not to pay <\s>
<s> but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed <\s>
<s> and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen <\s>
<s> for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note <\s>
<s> so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london dining room that day <\s>
<s> pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday <\s>
<s> his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over it and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree <\s>

<s> prodigal's return such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit <\s>
<s> he wishes the deed were done and done quickly <\s>
<s> he is sorry but que voulez vous <\s>
<s> the tooth must be taken out and he has you in the chair and it is surprising with what courage and vigour of wrist he applies the forceps <\s>
<s> perhaps he would not be quite so active or eager if it were his tooth but in fine it is your duty to have it out <\s>
<s> so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs <\s>
<s> portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow <\s>
<s> she had the news already <\s>
<s> she had read pen's letter and it had relieved her somehow <\s>
<s> a gloomy presentiment of evil had been hanging over her for many many months past <\s>
<s> she knew the worst now and her darling boy was come back to her repentant and tender hearted <\s>
<s> did she want more <\s>
<s> all that the rector could say and his remarks were both dictated by common sense and made respectable by antiquity could not bring helen to feel any indignation or particular unhappiness except that the boy should be unhappy <\s>
<s> what was this degree that they made such an outcry about and what good would it do pen <\s>
<s> why did doctor portman and his uncle insist upon sending the boy to a place where there was so much temptation to be risked and so little good to be won <\s>
<s> why didn't they leave him at home with his mother <\s>
<s> as for his debts of course they must be paid his debts wasn't his father's money all his and hadn't he a right to spend it <\s>
<s> in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom <\s>
<s> for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals <\s>
<s> coming back from college after an absence from home of some months in place of the simple girl whom he had left behind him mr <\s>
<s> arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute <\s>
<s> i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years <\s>
<s> at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women <\s>
<s> but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her <\s>
<s> she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence <\s>
<s> her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life <\s>
<s> good natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another <\s>
<s> it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss laura's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight <\s>
<s> as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantrap's and without the powder which her ladyship uses <\s>
<s> her nose must be left to the reader's imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music <\s>
<s> because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs <\s>
<s> pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis <\s>
<s> in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady <\s>
<s> many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty <\s>
<s> now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pen's general conduct and bearing <\s>
<s> his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short <\s>
<s> it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthur's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements <\s>
<s> it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i don't see that he gets many prizes <\s>
<s> why doesn't he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses <\s>
<s> there is nobody there will love him half so much as as you do <\s>
<s> as i do only laura <\s>
<s> laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helen's fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth <\s>
<s> perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation <\s>
<s> and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the woman's love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us <\s>
<s> also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthur's latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura <\s>
<s> not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr <\s>
<s> pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his words neglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life <\s>
<s> it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing gown when the gentle widow returned from those duties <\s>
<s> the hero of laura's early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boy's virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts <\s>
<s> the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura <\s>
<s> a pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that <\s>
<s> helen's boy galloping away from home day after day to fall on his knees to an actress and drink with her horrid father <\s>
<s> a good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house and set her over his mother <\s>
<s> i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said <\s>
<s> and you would have left me too then <\s>
<s> helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each other's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex <\s>
<s> whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthur's passion <\s>
<s> perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs <\s>
<s> portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church time perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge <\s>
<s> albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection such affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend <\s>
<s> it was devotion it was passion it was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate <\s>
<s> do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them <\s>
<s> these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemen with all the rest of the minor animals <\s>
<s> but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion <\s>
<s> he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tender hearted <\s>
<s> she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pen's transgressions <\s>
<s> what were his debts <\s>
<s> they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle's order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented <\s>
<s> disgraced by not getting his degree <\s>
<s> the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldn't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head <\s>
<s> other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure <\s>
<s> and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helen's hand and kissed her in the doctor's presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother's pen <\s>
<s> when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter <\s>
<s> there must be some jealousy against pen <\s>
<s> she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of him nothing more likely <\s>
<s> altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed <\s>
<s> pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity <\s>
<s> indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she won't repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company <\s>
<s> and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr <\s>
<s> arthur's rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long <\s>
<s> laura added a postscript to helen's letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura <\s>
<s> in the middle of the night as these two ladies after reading their bibles a great deal during the evening and after taking just a look into pen's room as they passed to their own in the middle of the night i say laura whose head not unfrequently chose to occupy that pillow which the nightcap of the late pendennis had been accustomed to press cried out suddenly mamma are you awake <\s>

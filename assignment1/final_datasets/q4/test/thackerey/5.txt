<s> our friend doctor portman of clavering was one of the dean's guests and being a gallant man and seeing from his place at the mahogany the dean's lady walking up and down the grass with her children sporting around her and her pink parasol over her lovely head the doctor stept out of the french windows of the dining room into the lawn which skirts that apartment and left the other white neckcloths to gird at my lord bishop <\s>
<s> then the doctor went up and offered mrs <\s>
<s> dean his arm and they sauntered over the ancient velvet lawn which had been mowed and rolled for immemorial deans in that easy quiet comfortable manner in which people of middle age and good temper walk after a good dinner in a calm golden summer evening when the sun has but just sunk behind the enormous cathedral towers and the sickle shaped moon is growing every instant brighter in the heavens <\s>
<s> now at the end of the dean's garden there is as we have stated mrs <\s>
<s> creed's house and the windows of the first floor room were open to admit the pleasant summer air <\s>
<s> a young lady of six and twenty whose eyes were perfectly wide open and a luckless boy of eighteen blind with love and infatuation were in that chamber together in which persons as we have before seen them in the same place the reader will have no difficulty in recognising mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis and miss costigan <\s>
<s> the poor boy had taken the plunge <\s>
<s> trembling with passionate emotion his heart beating and throbbing fiercely tears rushing forth in spite of him his voice almost choking with feeling poor pen had said those words which he could withhold no more and flung himself and his whole store of love and admiration and ardour at the feet of this mature beauty <\s>
<s> is he the first who has done so <\s>
<s> have none before or after him staked all their treasure of life as a savage does his land and possessions against a draught of the fair skins fire water or a couple of bauble eyes <\s>
<s> does your mother know of this arthur <\s>
<s> said miss fotheringay slowly <\s>
<s> he seized her hand madly and kissed it a thousand times <\s>
<s> she did not withdraw it <\s>
<s> does the old lady know it <\s>
<s> miss costigan thought to herself well perhaps she may and then she remembered what a handsome diamond cross mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis had on the night of the play and thought sure twill go in the family <\s>
<s> calm yourself dear arthur she said in her low rich voice and sniffled sweetly and gravely upon him <\s>
<s> then with her disengaged hand she put the hair lightly off his throbbing forehead <\s>
<s> he was in such a rapture and whirl of happiness that he could hardly speak <\s>
<s> at last he gasped out my mother has seen you and admires you beyond measure <\s>
<s> she will learn to love you soon who can do otherwise <\s>
<s> she will love you because i do <\s>
<s> deed then i think you do said miss costigan perhaps with a sort of pity for pen <\s>
<s> of course here mr <\s>
<s> pen went off into a rhapsody through which as we have perfect command over our own feelings we have no reason to follow the lad <\s>
<s> of course love truth and eternity were produced and words were tried but found impossible to plumb the tremendous depth of his affection <\s>
<s> this speech we say is no business of ours <\s>
<s> it was most likely not very wise but what right have we to overhear <\s>
<s> let the poor boy fling out his simple heart at the woman's feet and deal gently with him <\s>
<s> it is best to love wisely no doubt but to love foolishly is better than not to be able to love at all <\s>
<s> some of us can't and are proud of our impotence too <\s>
<s> at the end of his speech pen again kissed the imperial hand with rapture and i believe it was at this very moment and while mrs <\s>
<s> dean and doctor portman were engaged in conversation that young master ridley roset her son pulled his mother by the back of her capacious dress and said i say ma <\s>
<s> look up there and he waggled his innocent head <\s>
<s> that was indeed a view from the dean's garden such as seldom is seen by deans or is written in chapters <\s>
<s> there was poor pen performing a salute upon the rosy fingers of his charmer who received the embrace with perfect calmness and good humour <\s>
<s> master ridley looked up and grinned little miss rosa looked at her brother and opened the mouth of astonishment <\s>
<s> dean's countenance defied expression and as for dr <\s>
<s> portman when he beheld the scene and saw his prime favourite and dear pupil pen he stood mute with rage and wonder <\s>
<s> haller spied the party below at the same moment and gave a start and a laugh <\s>
<s> sure there's somebody in the dean's garden she cried out and withdrew with perfect calmness whilst pen darted away with his face glowing like coals <\s>
<s> the garden party had re entered the house when he ventured to look out again <\s>
<s> the sickle moon was blazing bright in the heavens then the stars were glittering the bell of the cathedral tolling nine the dean's guests all save one who had called for his horse dumpling and ridden off early were partaking of tea and buttered cakes in mrs <\s>
<s> dean's drawing room when pen took leave of miss costigan <\s>
<s> pen arrived at home in due time afterwards and was going to slip off to bed for the poor lad was greatly worn and agitated and his high strung nerves had been at almost a maddening pitch when a summons came to him by john the old footman whose countenance bore a very ominous look that his mother must see him below <\s>
<s> on this he tied on his neckcloth again and went downstairs to the drawing room <\s>
<s> there sate not only his mother but her friend the reverend doctor portman <\s>
<s> helen's face looked very pale by the light of the lamp the doctor's was flushed on the contrary and quivering with anger and emotion <\s>
<s> pen saw at once that there was a crisis and that there had been a discovery <\s>
<s> now for it he thought <\s>
<s> where have you been arthur <\s>
<s> helen said in a trembling voice <\s>
<s> how can you look that that dear lady and a christian clergyman in the face sir <\s>
<s> bounced out the doctor in spite of helen's pale appealing looks <\s>
<s> where has he been <\s>

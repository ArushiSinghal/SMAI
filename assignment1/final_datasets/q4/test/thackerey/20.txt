<s> it is painful to be obliged to record the weaknesses of fathers but it must be furthermore told of costigan that when his credit was exhausted and his money gone he would not unfrequently beg money from his daughter and made statements to her not altogether consistent with strict truth <\s>

<s> also it was not pleasant for sir charles mirabel to have letters constantly addressed to him at brookes's with the information that captain costigan was in the hall waiting for an answer or when he went to play his rubber at the travellers to be obliged to shoot out of his brougham and run up the steps rapidly lest his father in law should seize upon him and to think that while he read his paper or played his whist the captain was walking on the opposite side of pall mall with that dreadful cocked hat and the eye beneath it fixed steadily upon the windows of the club <\s>
<s> sir charles was a weak man he was old and had many infirmities he cried about his father in law to his wife whom he adored with senile infatuation he said he must go abroad he must go and live in the country he should die or have another fit if he saw that man again he knew he should <\s>
<s> and it was only by paying a second visit to captain costigan and representing to him that if he plagued sir charles by letters or addressed him in the street or made any further applications for loans his allowance would be withdrawn altogether that lady mirabel was enabled to keep her papa in order and to restore tranquillity to her husband <\s>
<s> and on occasion of this visit she sternly rebuked bows for not keeping a better watch over the captain desired that he should not be allowed to drink in that shameful way and that the people at the horrid taverns which he frequented should be told upon no account to give him credit <\s>

<s> we have said that these anonymous chambers of strong's had been very comfortably furnished since the arrival of sir francis clavering in london and the chevalier might boast with reason to the friends who visited him that few retired captains were more snugly quartered than he in his crib in shepherd's inn <\s>

<s> added to these was sir francis clavering bart who liked their society though he did not much add to its amusements by his convivial powers <\s>

<s> when altamont first returned from paris and after he had communicated with sir francis clavering from the hotel at which he had taken up his quarters and which he had reached in a very denuded state considering the wealth of diamonds and rubies with which this honest man was entrusted strong was sent to his patron by the baronet paid his little bill at the inn and invited him to come and sleep for a night or two at the chambers where he subsequently took up his residence <\s>
<s> to negotiate with this man was very well but to have such a person settled in his rooms and to be constantly burthened with such society did not suit the chevalier's taste much and he grumbled not a little to his principal <\s>

<s> in which the colonel narrates some of his adventures early in the forenoon of the day after the dinner in grosvenor place at which colonel altamont had chosen to appear the colonel emerged from his chamber in the upper story at shepherd's inn and entered into strong's sitting room where the chevalier sate in his easy chair with the newspaper and his cigar <\s>

<s> that enjoyment never failed him he had always an easy temper a faultless digestion and a rosy cheek and whether he was going into action the next morning or to prison and both had been his lot in the camp or the fleet the worthy captain snored healthfully through the night and woke with a good heart and appetite for the struggles or difficulties or pleasures of the day <\s>
<s> the first act of colonel altamont was to bellow to grady for a pint of pale ale the which he first poured into a pewter flagon whence he transferred it to his own lips <\s>
<s> he put down the tankard empty drew a great breath wiped his mouth in his dressing gown the difference of the colour of his beard from his dyed whiskers had long struck captain strong who had seen too that his hair was fair under his black wig but made no remarks upon these circumstances the colonel drew a great breath and professed himself immensely refreshed by his draught <\s>

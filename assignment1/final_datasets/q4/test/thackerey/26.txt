<s> though she was very angry with bows she went to his room at her accustomed hour in the day and there the good hearted musician began to talk to her <\s>
<s> pendennis last night fanny he said <\s>
<s> i thought you did fanny answered looking fiercely at the melancholy old gentleman <\s>
<s> i've been fond of you ever since we came to live in this place he continued <\s>
<s> you were a child when i came and you used to like me fanny until three or four days ago until you saw this gentleman <\s>
<s> and now i suppose you are going to say ill of him said fanny <\s>
<s> bows that will make me like you better <\s>
<s> indeed i shall do no such thing bows answered i think he is a very good and honest young man <\s>
<s> you know that if you said a word against him i would never speak a word to you again never <\s>
<s> cried miss fanny and clenched her little hand and paced up and down the room <\s>
<s> bows noted watched and followed the ardent little creature with admiration and gloomy sympathy <\s>
<s> why did you break my heart and refuse him <\s>
<s> it is you who led him into crime <\s>
<s> it is you who flung him into the arms of this this woman don't speak to me don't answer me <\s>
<s> i will never forgive you never <\s>
<s> martha bring me my bonnet and shawl <\s>
<s> i won't have you come with me <\s>
<s> leave me cruel girl why have you brought this shame on me <\s>
<s> and bidding her daughter and her servants keep away from her she ran down the road to clavering <\s>
<s> doctor portman glancing over the letter thought he knew the handwriting and of course was already acquainted with the charge made against poor pen <\s>
<s> against his own conscience perhaps for the worthy doctor like most of us had a considerable natural aptitude for receiving any report unfavourable to his neighbours he strove to console helen he pointed out that the slander came from an anonymous quarter and therefore must be the work of a rascal that the charge might not be true was not true most likely at least that pen must be heard before he was condemned that the son of such a mother was not likely to commit such a crime etc <\s>
<s> helen at once saw through his feint of objection and denial <\s>
<s> you think he has done it she said you know you think he has done it <\s>
<s> oh why did i ever leave him doctor portman or suffer him away from me <\s>
<s> but he can't be dishonest pray god not dishonest you don't think that do you <\s>
<s> remember his conduct about that other person how madly he was attached to her <\s>
<s> he was an honest boy then he is now <\s>
<s> and i thank god yes i fall down on my knees and thank god he paid laura <\s>
<s> you said he was good you did yourself <\s>
<s> and now if this woman loves him and you know they must if he has taken her from her home or she tempted him which is most likely why still she must be his wife and my daughter <\s>
<s> and he must leave the dreadful world and come back to me to his mother doctor portman <\s>
<s> let us go away and bring him back yes bring him back and there shall be joy for the the sinner that repenteth <\s>
<s> let us go now directly dear friend this very helen could say no more <\s>
<s> she fell back and fainted <\s>
<s> she was carried to a bed in the house of the pitying doctor and the surgeon was called to attend her <\s>
<s> she lay all night in an alarming state <\s>
<s> laura came to her or to the rectory rather for she would not see laura <\s>
<s> and doctor portman still beseeching her to be tranquil and growing bolder and more confident of arthur's innocence as he witnessed the terrible grief of the poor mother wrote a letter to pen warning him of the rumours that were against him and earnestly praying that he would break off and repent of a connexion so fatal to his best interests and his soul's welfare <\s>
<s> and laura was her heart not wrung by the thought of arthur's crime and helen's estrangement <\s>
<s> was it not a bitter blow for the innocent girl to think that at one stroke she should lose all the love which she cared for in the world <\s>
<s> which had very nearly been the last of the story doctor portman's letter was sent off to its destination in london and the worthy clergyman endeavoured to soothe down mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis into some state of composure until an answer should arrive which the doctor tried to think or at any rate persisted in saying would be satisfactory as regarded the morality of mr <\s>
<s> at least helen's wisdom of moving upon london and appearing in person to warn her son of his wickedness was impracticable for a day or two <\s>
<s> the apothecary forbade her moving even so far as fairoaks for the first day and it was not until the subsequent morning that she found herself again back on her sofa at home with the faithful though silent laura nursing at her side <\s>
<s> unluckily for himself and all parties pen never read that homily which doctor portman addressed to him until many weeks after the epistle had been composed and day after day the widow waited for her son's reply to the charges against him her own illness increasing with every day's delay <\s>
<s> it was a hard task for laura to bear the anxiety to witness her dearest friend's suffering worst of all to support helen's estrangement and the pain caused to her by that averted affection <\s>
<s> but it was the custom of this young lady to the utmost of her power and by means of that gracious assistance which heaven awarded to her pure and constant prayers to do her duty <\s>
<s> and as that duty was performed quite noiselessly while the supplications which endowed her with the requisite strength for fulfilling it also took place in her own chamber away from all mortal sight we too must be perforce silent about these virtues of hers which no more bear public talking about than a flower will bear to bloom in a ballroom <\s>
<s> this only we will say that a good woman is the loveliest flower that blooms under heaven and that we look with love and wonder upon its silent grace its pure fragrance its delicate bloom of beauty <\s>
<s> sweet and beautiful the fairest and the most spotless is it not pity to see them bowed down or devoured by grief or death inexorable wasting in disease pining with long pain or cut off by sudden fate in their prime <\s>
<s> we may deserve grief but why should these be unhappy except that we know that heaven chastens those whom it loves best being pleased by repeated trials to make these pure spirits more pure <\s>
<s> so pen never got the letter although it was duly posted and faithfully discharged by the postman into his letter box in lamb court and thence carried by the laundress to his writing table with the rest of his lordship's correspondence into which room have we not seen a picture of him entering from his little bedroom adjoining as mrs <\s>
<s> flanagan his laundress was in the act of drinking his gin <\s>
<s> those kind readers who have watched mr <\s>
<s> arthur's career hitherto and have made as they naturally would do observations upon the moral character and peculiarities of their acquaintance have probably discovered by this time what was the prevailing fault in mr <\s>
<s> pen's disposition and who was that greatest enemy artfully indicated in the title page with whom he had to contend <\s>
<s> not a few of us my beloved public have the very same rascal to contend with a scoundrel who takes every opportunity of bringing us into mischief of plunging us into quarrels of leading us into idleness and unprofitable company and what not <\s>
<s> in a word pen's greatest enemy was himself and as he had been pampering and coaxing and indulging that individual all his life the rogue grew insolent as all spoiled servants will be and at the slightest attempt to coerce him or make him do that which was unpleasant to him became frantically rude and unruly <\s>
<s> a person who is used to making sacrifices laura for instance who had got such a habit of giving up her own pleasure for others can do the business quite easily but pen unaccustomed as he was to any sort of self denial suffered woundily when called on to pay his share and savagely grumbled at being obliged to forgo anything he liked <\s>
<s> he had resolved in his mighty mind then that he would not see fanny and he wouldn't <\s>
<s> he tried to drive the thoughts of that fascinating little person out of his head by constant occupation by exercise by dissipation and society <\s>
<s> he worked then too much he walked and rode too much he ate drank and smoked too much nor could all the cigars and the punch of which he partook drive little fanny's image out of his inflamed brain and at the end of a week of this discipline and self denial our young gentleman was in bed with a fever <\s>

<s> whilst such business as this was going on within a rather shabby old gentleman would come and lead away the pale girl in the black bonnet who had no right to be abroad in the night air and the temple porters the few laundresses and other amateurs who had been listening to the concert would also disappear <\s>

<s> laura looked at warrington with the archest sparkle in her eyes warrington fairly burst out into a boohoo of laughter even the widow was obliged to laugh and the major erubescent confounded the impudence of the young folks and said when he had his hair cut he would keep a lock of it for miss laura <\s>

<s> warrington and miss bell got some flowers off the ladies bonnets and made a wreath with which they decorated the wig and brought it out in procession and did homage before it <\s>
<s> in fact they indulged in a hundred sports jularities waggeries and petits jeux innocens so that the second and third floors of number 6 lamb court temple rang with more cheerfulness and laughter than had been known in those precincts for many a long day <\s>
<s> at last after about ten days of this life one evening when the little spy of the court came out to take her usual post of observation at the lamp there was no music from the second floor window there were no lights in the third story chambers the windows of each were open and the occupants were gone <\s>

<s> the antique travelling chariot was brought out again and cushioned with many pillows for pen and his mother and miss laura went in the most affable manner in the omnibus under the guardianship of mr <\s>

<s> the widow had left a jar full of flowers upon his table prettily arranged and when he entered they filled the solitary room with odour <\s>
<s> they were memorials of the kind gentle souls who had gone away and who had decorated for a little while that lonely cheerless place <\s>
<s> he had had the happiest days of his whole life george felt he knew it now they were just gone he went and took up the flowers and put his face to them and smelt them perhaps kissed them <\s>
<s> as he put them down he rubbed his rough hand across his eyes with a bitter word and laugh <\s>
<s> the women had spoiled him as we like them and as they like to do <\s>
<s> they had cloyed him with obedience and surfeited him with sweet respect and submission until he grew weary of the slaves who waited upon him and their caresses and cajoleries excited him no more <\s>

<s> he wears a beard and he likes his women to be slaves <\s>
<s> what man would be henpecked i say <\s>

<s> well then arthur being so languid and indifferent and careless about the favours bestowed upon him how came it that laura should have such a love and rapturous regard for him that a mere inadequate expression of it should have kept the girl talking all the way from fairoaks to london as she and helen travelled in the post chaise <\s>
<s> as soon as helen had finished one story about the dear fellow and narrated with a hundred sobs and ejaculations and looks up to heaven some thrilling incidents which occurred about the period when the hero was breeched laura began another equally interesting and equally ornamented with tears and told how heroically he had a tooth out or wouldn't have it out or how daringly he robbed a bird's nest or how magnanimously he spared it or how he gave a shilling to the old woman on the common or went without his bread and butter for the beggar boy who came into the yard and so on one to another the sobbing women sang laments upon their hero who my worthy reader has long since perceived is no more a hero than one of us <\s>
<s> being as he was why should a sensible girl be so fond of him <\s>
<s> this point has been argued before in a previous unfortunate sentence which lately drew down all the wrath of ireland upon the writer's head and which said that the greatest rascal cut throats have had somebody to be fond of them and if those monsters why not ordinary mortals <\s>
<s> and with whom shall a young lady fall in love but with the person she sees <\s>
<s> she is not supposed to lose her heart in a dream like a princess in the arabian nights or to plight her young affections to the portrait of a gentleman in the exhibition or a sketch in the illustrated london news <\s>
<s> you have an instinct within you which inclines you to attach yourself to some one you meet somebody you hear somebody constantly praised you walk or ride or waltz or talk or sit in the same pew at church with somebody you meet again and again and marriages are made in heave your dear mamma says pinning your orange flowers wreath on with her blessed eyes dimmed with tears and there is a wedding breakfast and you take off your white satin and retire to your coach and four and you and he are a happy pair or the affair is broken off and then poor wounded heart <\s>
<s> why then you meet somebody else and twine your young affections round number two <\s>
<s> it is your nature so to do <\s>
<s> do you suppose it is all for the man's sake that you love and not a bit for your own <\s>
<s> do you suppose you would drink if you were not thirsty or eat if you were not hungry <\s>
<s> so then laura liked pen because she saw scarcely anybody else at fairoaks except doctor portman and captain glanders and because his mother constantly praised her arthur and because he was gentlemanlike tolerably good looking and witty and because above all it was of her nature to like somebody <\s>
<s> and having once received this image into her heart she there tenderly nursed it and clasped it she there in his long absences and her constant solitudes silently brooded over it and fondled it and when after this she came to london and had an opportunity of becoming rather intimate with mr <\s>

<s> whilst such business as this was going on within a rather shabby old gentleman would come and lead away the pale girl in the black bonnet who had no right to be abroad in the night air and the temple porters the few laundresses and other amateurs who had been listening to the concert would also disappear <\s>

<s> warrington and miss bell got some flowers off the ladies bonnets and made a wreath with which they decorated the wig and brought it out in procession and did homage before it <\s>

<s> the widow had left a jar full of flowers upon his table prettily arranged and when he entered they filled the solitary room with odour <\s>
<s> they were memorials of the kind gentle souls who had gone away and who had decorated for a little while that lonely cheerless place <\s>
<s> he had had the happiest days of his whole life george felt he knew it now they were just gone he went and took up the flowers and put his face to them and smelt them perhaps kissed them <\s>
<s> as he put them down he rubbed his rough hand across his eyes with a bitter word and laugh <\s>
<s> the women had spoiled him as we like them and as they like to do <\s>

<s> he wears a beard and he likes his women to be slaves <\s>
<s> what man would be henpecked i say <\s>

<s> well then arthur being so languid and indifferent and careless about the favours bestowed upon him how came it that laura should have such a love and rapturous regard for him that a mere inadequate expression of it should have kept the girl talking all the way from fairoaks to london as she and helen travelled in the post chaise <\s>
<s> as soon as helen had finished one story about the dear fellow and narrated with a hundred sobs and ejaculations and looks up to heaven some thrilling incidents which occurred about the period when the hero was breeched laura began another equally interesting and equally ornamented with tears and told how heroically he had a tooth out or wouldn't have it out or how daringly he robbed a bird's nest or how magnanimously he spared it or how he gave a shilling to the old woman on the common or went without his bread and butter for the beggar boy who came into the yard and so on one to another the sobbing women sang laments upon their hero who my worthy reader has long since perceived is no more a hero than one of us <\s>
<s> being as he was why should a sensible girl be so fond of him <\s>
<s> this point has been argued before in a previous unfortunate sentence which lately drew down all the wrath of ireland upon the writer's head and which said that the greatest rascal cut throats have had somebody to be fond of them and if those monsters why not ordinary mortals <\s>
<s> and with whom shall a young lady fall in love but with the person she sees <\s>
<s> she is not supposed to lose her heart in a dream like a princess in the arabian nights or to plight her young affections to the portrait of a gentleman in the exhibition or a sketch in the illustrated london news <\s>
<s> you have an instinct within you which inclines you to attach yourself to some one you meet somebody you hear somebody constantly praised you walk or ride or waltz or talk or sit in the same pew at church with somebody you meet again and again and marriages are made in heave your dear mamma says pinning your orange flowers wreath on with her blessed eyes dimmed with tears and there is a wedding breakfast and you take off your white satin and retire to your coach and four and you and he are a happy pair or the affair is broken off and then poor wounded heart <\s>
<s> why then you meet somebody else and twine your young affections round number two <\s>
<s> it is your nature so to do <\s>
<s> do you suppose it is all for the man's sake that you love and not a bit for your own <\s>
<s> do you suppose you would drink if you were not thirsty or eat if you were not hungry <\s>
<s> so then laura liked pen because she saw scarcely anybody else at fairoaks except doctor portman and captain glanders and because his mother constantly praised her arthur and because he was gentlemanlike tolerably good looking and witty and because above all it was of her nature to like somebody <\s>
<s> and having once received this image into her heart she there tenderly nursed it and clasped it she there in his long absences and her constant solitudes silently brooded over it and fondled it and when after this she came to london and had an opportunity of becoming rather intimate with mr <\s>
<s> george warrington what on earth was to prevent her from thinking him a most odd original agreeable and pleasing person <\s>
<s> a long time afterwards when these days were over and fate in its own way had disposed of the various persons now assembled in the dingy building in lamb court perhaps some of them looked back and thought how happy the time was and how pleasant had been their evening talks and little walks and simple recreations round the sofa of pen the convalescent <\s>
<s> the major had a favourable opinion of september in london from that time forward and declared at his clubs and in society that the dead season in town was often pleasant doosid pleasant begad <\s>
<s> he used to go home to his lodgings in bury street of a night wondering that it was already so late and that the evening had passed away so quickly <\s>
<s> he made his appearance at the temple pretty constantly in the afternoon and tugged up the long black staircase with quite a benevolent activity and perseverance <\s>

<s> and the permission to drink a glass or two of pure sherry being accorded to pen by doctor goodenough the major told with almost tears in his eyes how his noble friend the marquis of steyne passing through london on his way to the continent had ordered any quantity of his precious his priceless amontillado that had been a present from king ferdinand to the noble marquis to be placed at the disposal of mr <\s>
<s> the widow and laura tasted it with respect though they didn't in the least like the bitter flavour but the invalid was greatly invigorated by it and warrington pronounced it superlatively good and proposed the major's health in a mock speech after dinner on the first day when the wine was served and that of lord steyne and the aristocracy in general <\s>

<s> the widow had left a jar full of flowers upon his table prettily arranged and when he entered they filled the solitary room with odour <\s>

<s> what man would be henpecked i say <\s>

<s> well then arthur being so languid and indifferent and careless about the favours bestowed upon him how came it that laura should have such a love and rapturous regard for him that a mere inadequate expression of it should have kept the girl talking all the way from fairoaks to london as she and helen travelled in the post chaise <\s>
<s> as soon as helen had finished one story about the dear fellow and narrated with a hundred sobs and ejaculations and looks up to heaven some thrilling incidents which occurred about the period when the hero was breeched laura began another equally interesting and equally ornamented with tears and told how heroically he had a tooth out or wouldn't have it out or how daringly he robbed a bird's nest or how magnanimously he spared it or how he gave a shilling to the old woman on the common or went without his bread and butter for the beggar boy who came into the yard and so on one to another the sobbing women sang laments upon their hero who my worthy reader has long since perceived is no more a hero than one of us <\s>
<s> being as he was why should a sensible girl be so fond of him <\s>
<s> this point has been argued before in a previous unfortunate sentence which lately drew down all the wrath of ireland upon the writer's head and which said that the greatest rascal cut throats have had somebody to be fond of them and if those monsters why not ordinary mortals <\s>
<s> and with whom shall a young lady fall in love but with the person she sees <\s>
<s> she is not supposed to lose her heart in a dream like a princess in the arabian nights or to plight her young affections to the portrait of a gentleman in the exhibition or a sketch in the illustrated london news <\s>
<s> you have an instinct within you which inclines you to attach yourself to some one you meet somebody you hear somebody constantly praised you walk or ride or waltz or talk or sit in the same pew at church with somebody you meet again and again and marriages are made in heave your dear mamma says pinning your orange flowers wreath on with her blessed eyes dimmed with tears and there is a wedding breakfast and you take off your white satin and retire to your coach and four and you and he are a happy pair or the affair is broken off and then poor wounded heart <\s>
<s> why then you meet somebody else and twine your young affections round number two <\s>
<s> it is your nature so to do <\s>
<s> do you suppose it is all for the man's sake that you love and not a bit for your own <\s>
<s> do you suppose you would drink if you were not thirsty or eat if you were not hungry <\s>
<s> so then laura liked pen because she saw scarcely anybody else at fairoaks except doctor portman and captain glanders and because his mother constantly praised her arthur and because he was gentlemanlike tolerably good looking and witty and because above all it was of her nature to like somebody <\s>
<s> and having once received this image into her heart she there tenderly nursed it and clasped it she there in his long absences and her constant solitudes silently brooded over it and fondled it and when after this she came to london and had an opportunity of becoming rather intimate with mr <\s>
<s> george warrington what on earth was to prevent her from thinking him a most odd original agreeable and pleasing person <\s>
<s> a long time afterwards when these days were over and fate in its own way had disposed of the various persons now assembled in the dingy building in lamb court perhaps some of them looked back and thought how happy the time was and how pleasant had been their evening talks and little walks and simple recreations round the sofa of pen the convalescent <\s>
<s> the major had a favourable opinion of september in london from that time forward and declared at his clubs and in society that the dead season in town was often pleasant doosid pleasant begad <\s>
<s> he used to go home to his lodgings in bury street of a night wondering that it was already so late and that the evening had passed away so quickly <\s>
<s> he made his appearance at the temple pretty constantly in the afternoon and tugged up the long black staircase with quite a benevolent activity and perseverance <\s>
<s> and he made interest with the chef at bays's that renowned cook the superintendence of whose work upon gastronomy compelled the gifted author to stay in the metropolis to prepare little jellies delicate clear soups aspics and other trifles good for invalids which morgan the valet constantly brought down to the little lamb court colony <\s>
<s> and the permission to drink a glass or two of pure sherry being accorded to pen by doctor goodenough the major told with almost tears in his eyes how his noble friend the marquis of steyne passing through london on his way to the continent had ordered any quantity of his precious his priceless amontillado that had been a present from king ferdinand to the noble marquis to be placed at the disposal of mr <\s>
<s> the widow and laura tasted it with respect though they didn't in the least like the bitter flavour but the invalid was greatly invigorated by it and warrington pronounced it superlatively good and proposed the major's health in a mock speech after dinner on the first day when the wine was served and that of lord steyne and the aristocracy in general <\s>
<s> major pendennis returned thanks with the utmost gravity and in a speech in which he used the words the present occasion at least the proper number of times <\s>
<s> pen cheered with his feeble voice from his armchair <\s>
<s> warrington taught miss laura to cry hear <\s>
<s> and tapped the table with his knuckles <\s>
<s> pidgeon the attendant grinned and honest doctor goodenough found the party so merrily engaged when he came in to pay his faithful gratuitous visit <\s>
<s> warrington knew sibwright who lived below and that gallant gentleman in reply to a letter informing him of the use to which his apartment had been put wrote back the most polite and flowery letter of acquiescence he placed his chambers at the service of their fair occupants his bed at their disposal his carpets at their feet <\s>
<s> everybody was kindly disposed towards the sick man and his family <\s>
<s> his heart and his mother's too as we may fancy melted within him at the thought of so much good feeling and good nature <\s>
<s> let pen's biographer be pardoned for alluding to a time not far distant when a somewhat similar mishap brought him a providential friend a kind physician and a thousand proofs of a most touching and surprising kindness and sympathy <\s>
<s> there was a piano in mr <\s>
<s> sibwright's chamber indeed this gentleman a lover of all the arts performed himself and excellently ill too upon the instrument and had had a song dedicated to him the words by himself the air by his devoted friend leopoldo twankidillo and at this music box as mr <\s>
<s> warrington called it laura at first with a great deal of tremor and blushing which became her very much played and sang sometimes of an evening simple airs and old songs of home <\s>
<s> her voice was a rich contralto and warrington who scarcely knew one tune from another and who had but one tune or bray in his repertoire a most discordant imitation of god save the king' sat rapt in delight listening to these songs <\s>
<s> he could follow their rhythm if not their harmony and he could watch with a constant and daily growing enthusiasm the pure and tender and generous creature who made the music <\s>
<s> i wonder how that poor pale little girl in the black bonnet who used to stand at the lamp post in lamb court sometimes of an evening looking up to the open windows from which the music came liked to hear it <\s>

<s> the widow had left a jar full of flowers upon his table prettily arranged and when he entered they filled the solitary room with odour <\s>
<s> they were memorials of the kind gentle souls who had gone away and who had decorated for a little while that lonely cheerless place <\s>

<s> he wears a beard and he likes his women to be slaves <\s>
<s> what man would be henpecked i say <\s>

<s> well then arthur being so languid and indifferent and careless about the favours bestowed upon him how came it that laura should have such a love and rapturous regard for him that a mere inadequate expression of it should have kept the girl talking all the way from fairoaks to london as she and helen travelled in the post chaise <\s>
<s> as soon as helen had finished one story about the dear fellow and narrated with a hundred sobs and ejaculations and looks up to heaven some thrilling incidents which occurred about the period when the hero was breeched laura began another equally interesting and equally ornamented with tears and told how heroically he had a tooth out or wouldn't have it out or how daringly he robbed a bird's nest or how magnanimously he spared it or how he gave a shilling to the old woman on the common or went without his bread and butter for the beggar boy who came into the yard and so on one to another the sobbing women sang laments upon their hero who my worthy reader has long since perceived is no more a hero than one of us <\s>
<s> being as he was why should a sensible girl be so fond of him <\s>
<s> this point has been argued before in a previous unfortunate sentence which lately drew down all the wrath of ireland upon the writer's head and which said that the greatest rascal cut throats have had somebody to be fond of them and if those monsters why not ordinary mortals <\s>
<s> and with whom shall a young lady fall in love but with the person she sees <\s>
<s> she is not supposed to lose her heart in a dream like a princess in the arabian nights or to plight her young affections to the portrait of a gentleman in the exhibition or a sketch in the illustrated london news <\s>
<s> you have an instinct within you which inclines you to attach yourself to some one you meet somebody you hear somebody constantly praised you walk or ride or waltz or talk or sit in the same pew at church with somebody you meet again and again and marriages are made in heave your dear mamma says pinning your orange flowers wreath on with her blessed eyes dimmed with tears and there is a wedding breakfast and you take off your white satin and retire to your coach and four and you and he are a happy pair or the affair is broken off and then poor wounded heart <\s>
<s> why then you meet somebody else and twine your young affections round number two <\s>
<s> it is your nature so to do <\s>
<s> do you suppose it is all for the man's sake that you love and not a bit for your own <\s>
<s> do you suppose you would drink if you were not thirsty or eat if you were not hungry <\s>
<s> so then laura liked pen because she saw scarcely anybody else at fairoaks except doctor portman and captain glanders and because his mother constantly praised her arthur and because he was gentlemanlike tolerably good looking and witty and because above all it was of her nature to like somebody <\s>
<s> and having once received this image into her heart she there tenderly nursed it and clasped it she there in his long absences and her constant solitudes silently brooded over it and fondled it and when after this she came to london and had an opportunity of becoming rather intimate with mr <\s>
<s> george warrington what on earth was to prevent her from thinking him a most odd original agreeable and pleasing person <\s>
<s> a long time afterwards when these days were over and fate in its own way had disposed of the various persons now assembled in the dingy building in lamb court perhaps some of them looked back and thought how happy the time was and how pleasant had been their evening talks and little walks and simple recreations round the sofa of pen the convalescent <\s>
<s> the major had a favourable opinion of september in london from that time forward and declared at his clubs and in society that the dead season in town was often pleasant doosid pleasant begad <\s>
<s> he used to go home to his lodgings in bury street of a night wondering that it was already so late and that the evening had passed away so quickly <\s>
<s> he made his appearance at the temple pretty constantly in the afternoon and tugged up the long black staircase with quite a benevolent activity and perseverance <\s>
<s> and he made interest with the chef at bays's that renowned cook the superintendence of whose work upon gastronomy compelled the gifted author to stay in the metropolis to prepare little jellies delicate clear soups aspics and other trifles good for invalids which morgan the valet constantly brought down to the little lamb court colony <\s>
<s> and the permission to drink a glass or two of pure sherry being accorded to pen by doctor goodenough the major told with almost tears in his eyes how his noble friend the marquis of steyne passing through london on his way to the continent had ordered any quantity of his precious his priceless amontillado that had been a present from king ferdinand to the noble marquis to be placed at the disposal of mr <\s>
<s> the widow and laura tasted it with respect though they didn't in the least like the bitter flavour but the invalid was greatly invigorated by it and warrington pronounced it superlatively good and proposed the major's health in a mock speech after dinner on the first day when the wine was served and that of lord steyne and the aristocracy in general <\s>
<s> major pendennis returned thanks with the utmost gravity and in a speech in which he used the words the present occasion at least the proper number of times <\s>
<s> pen cheered with his feeble voice from his armchair <\s>
<s> warrington taught miss laura to cry hear <\s>
<s> and tapped the table with his knuckles <\s>
<s> pidgeon the attendant grinned and honest doctor goodenough found the party so merrily engaged when he came in to pay his faithful gratuitous visit <\s>
<s> warrington knew sibwright who lived below and that gallant gentleman in reply to a letter informing him of the use to which his apartment had been put wrote back the most polite and flowery letter of acquiescence he placed his chambers at the service of their fair occupants his bed at their disposal his carpets at their feet <\s>
<s> everybody was kindly disposed towards the sick man and his family <\s>
<s> his heart and his mother's too as we may fancy melted within him at the thought of so much good feeling and good nature <\s>
<s> let pen's biographer be pardoned for alluding to a time not far distant when a somewhat similar mishap brought him a providential friend a kind physician and a thousand proofs of a most touching and surprising kindness and sympathy <\s>
<s> there was a piano in mr <\s>
<s> sibwright's chamber indeed this gentleman a lover of all the arts performed himself and excellently ill too upon the instrument and had had a song dedicated to him the words by himself the air by his devoted friend leopoldo twankidillo and at this music box as mr <\s>
<s> warrington called it laura at first with a great deal of tremor and blushing which became her very much played and sang sometimes of an evening simple airs and old songs of home <\s>
<s> her voice was a rich contralto and warrington who scarcely knew one tune from another and who had but one tune or bray in his repertoire a most discordant imitation of god save the king' sat rapt in delight listening to these songs <\s>
<s> he could follow their rhythm if not their harmony and he could watch with a constant and daily growing enthusiasm the pure and tender and generous creature who made the music <\s>
<s> i wonder how that poor pale little girl in the black bonnet who used to stand at the lamp post in lamb court sometimes of an evening looking up to the open windows from which the music came liked to hear it <\s>
<s> when pen's bedtime came the songs were hushed <\s>
<s> lights appeared in the upper room his room whither the widow used to conduct him and then the major and mr <\s>
<s> warrington and sometimes miss laura would have a game at ecarte or backgammon or she would sit by working a pair of slippers in worsted a pair of gentleman's slippers they might have been for arthur or for george or for major pendennis one of those three would have given anything for the slippers <\s>
<s> whilst such business as this was going on within a rather shabby old gentleman would come and lead away the pale girl in the black bonnet who had no right to be abroad in the night air and the temple porters the few laundresses and other amateurs who had been listening to the concert would also disappear <\s>
<s> just before ten o'clock there was another musical performance namely that of the chimes of st <\s>

<s> as they were ringing laura began to fold up the slippers martha from fairoaks appeared with a bed candle and a constant smile on her face the major said god bless my soul is it so late <\s>
<s> warrington and he left their unfinished game and got up and shook hands with miss bell <\s>
<s> martha from fairoaks lighted them out of the passage and down the stair and as they descended they could hear her bolting and locking the sporting door after them upon her young mistress and herself <\s>
<s> if there had been any danger grinning martha said she would have got down that thar hooky soord which hung up in gantleman's room meaning the damascus scimitar with the names of the prophet engraved on the blade and the red velvet scabbard which percy sibwright esquire brought back from his tour in the levant along with an albanian dress and which he wore with such elegant effect at lady mullingar's fancy ball gloucester square hyde park <\s>

<s> well then arthur being so languid and indifferent and careless about the favours bestowed upon him how came it that laura should have such a love and rapturous regard for him that a mere inadequate expression of it should have kept the girl talking all the way from fairoaks to london as she and helen travelled in the post chaise <\s>
<s> as soon as helen had finished one story about the dear fellow and narrated with a hundred sobs and ejaculations and looks up to heaven some thrilling incidents which occurred about the period when the hero was breeched laura began another equally interesting and equally ornamented with tears and told how heroically he had a tooth out or wouldn't have it out or how daringly he robbed a bird's nest or how magnanimously he spared it or how he gave a shilling to the old woman on the common or went without his bread and butter for the beggar boy who came into the yard and so on one to another the sobbing women sang laments upon their hero who my worthy reader has long since perceived is no more a hero than one of us <\s>
<s> being as he was why should a sensible girl be so fond of him <\s>
<s> this point has been argued before in a previous unfortunate sentence which lately drew down all the wrath of ireland upon the writer's head and which said that the greatest rascal cut throats have had somebody to be fond of them and if those monsters why not ordinary mortals <\s>
<s> and with whom shall a young lady fall in love but with the person she sees <\s>
<s> she is not supposed to lose her heart in a dream like a princess in the arabian nights or to plight her young affections to the portrait of a gentleman in the exhibition or a sketch in the illustrated london news <\s>
<s> you have an instinct within you which inclines you to attach yourself to some one you meet somebody you hear somebody constantly praised you walk or ride or waltz or talk or sit in the same pew at church with somebody you meet again and again and marriages are made in heave your dear mamma says pinning your orange flowers wreath on with her blessed eyes dimmed with tears and there is a wedding breakfast and you take off your white satin and retire to your coach and four and you and he are a happy pair or the affair is broken off and then poor wounded heart <\s>

<s> do you suppose it is all for the man's sake that you love and not a bit for your own <\s>

<s> so then laura liked pen because she saw scarcely anybody else at fairoaks except doctor portman and captain glanders and because his mother constantly praised her arthur and because he was gentlemanlike tolerably good looking and witty and because above all it was of her nature to like somebody <\s>
<s> and having once received this image into her heart she there tenderly nursed it and clasped it she there in his long absences and her constant solitudes silently brooded over it and fondled it and when after this she came to london and had an opportunity of becoming rather intimate with mr <\s>

<s> a long time afterwards when these days were over and fate in its own way had disposed of the various persons now assembled in the dingy building in lamb court perhaps some of them looked back and thought how happy the time was and how pleasant had been their evening talks and little walks and simple recreations round the sofa of pen the convalescent <\s>
<s> the major had a favourable opinion of september in london from that time forward and declared at his clubs and in society that the dead season in town was often pleasant doosid pleasant begad <\s>

<s> and the permission to drink a glass or two of pure sherry being accorded to pen by doctor goodenough the major told with almost tears in his eyes how his noble friend the marquis of steyne passing through london on his way to the continent had ordered any quantity of his precious his priceless amontillado that had been a present from king ferdinand to the noble marquis to be placed at the disposal of mr <\s>
<s> the widow and laura tasted it with respect though they didn't in the least like the bitter flavour but the invalid was greatly invigorated by it and warrington pronounced it superlatively good and proposed the major's health in a mock speech after dinner on the first day when the wine was served and that of lord steyne and the aristocracy in general <\s>
<s> major pendennis returned thanks with the utmost gravity and in a speech in which he used the words the present occasion at least the proper number of times <\s>

<s> everybody was kindly disposed towards the sick man and his family <\s>
<s> his heart and his mother's too as we may fancy melted within him at the thought of so much good feeling and good nature <\s>
<s> let pen's biographer be pardoned for alluding to a time not far distant when a somewhat similar mishap brought him a providential friend a kind physician and a thousand proofs of a most touching and surprising kindness and sympathy <\s>
<s> there was a piano in mr <\s>

<s> i wonder how that poor pale little girl in the black bonnet who used to stand at the lamp post in lamb court sometimes of an evening looking up to the open windows from which the music came liked to hear it <\s>

<s> well then arthur being so languid and indifferent and careless about the favours bestowed upon him how came it that laura should have such a love and rapturous regard for him that a mere inadequate expression of it should have kept the girl talking all the way from fairoaks to london as she and helen travelled in the post chaise <\s>
<s> as soon as helen had finished one story about the dear fellow and narrated with a hundred sobs and ejaculations and looks up to heaven some thrilling incidents which occurred about the period when the hero was breeched laura began another equally interesting and equally ornamented with tears and told how heroically he had a tooth out or wouldn't have it out or how daringly he robbed a bird's nest or how magnanimously he spared it or how he gave a shilling to the old woman on the common or went without his bread and butter for the beggar boy who came into the yard and so on one to another the sobbing women sang laments upon their hero who my worthy reader has long since perceived is no more a hero than one of us <\s>
<s> being as he was why should a sensible girl be so fond of him <\s>
<s> this point has been argued before in a previous unfortunate sentence which lately drew down all the wrath of ireland upon the writer's head and which said that the greatest rascal cut throats have had somebody to be fond of them and if those monsters why not ordinary mortals <\s>
<s> and with whom shall a young lady fall in love but with the person she sees <\s>
<s> she is not supposed to lose her heart in a dream like a princess in the arabian nights or to plight her young affections to the portrait of a gentleman in the exhibition or a sketch in the illustrated london news <\s>
<s> you have an instinct within you which inclines you to attach yourself to some one you meet somebody you hear somebody constantly praised you walk or ride or waltz or talk or sit in the same pew at church with somebody you meet again and again and marriages are made in heave your dear mamma says pinning your orange flowers wreath on with her blessed eyes dimmed with tears and there is a wedding breakfast and you take off your white satin and retire to your coach and four and you and he are a happy pair or the affair is broken off and then poor wounded heart <\s>
<s> why then you meet somebody else and twine your young affections round number two <\s>
<s> it is your nature so to do <\s>
<s> do you suppose it is all for the man's sake that you love and not a bit for your own <\s>
<s> do you suppose you would drink if you were not thirsty or eat if you were not hungry <\s>
<s> so then laura liked pen because she saw scarcely anybody else at fairoaks except doctor portman and captain glanders and because his mother constantly praised her arthur and because he was gentlemanlike tolerably good looking and witty and because above all it was of her nature to like somebody <\s>
<s> and having once received this image into her heart she there tenderly nursed it and clasped it she there in his long absences and her constant solitudes silently brooded over it and fondled it and when after this she came to london and had an opportunity of becoming rather intimate with mr <\s>

<s> a long time afterwards when these days were over and fate in its own way had disposed of the various persons now assembled in the dingy building in lamb court perhaps some of them looked back and thought how happy the time was and how pleasant had been their evening talks and little walks and simple recreations round the sofa of pen the convalescent <\s>

<s> and the permission to drink a glass or two of pure sherry being accorded to pen by doctor goodenough the major told with almost tears in his eyes how his noble friend the marquis of steyne passing through london on his way to the continent had ordered any quantity of his precious his priceless amontillado that had been a present from king ferdinand to the noble marquis to be placed at the disposal of mr <\s>
<s> the widow and laura tasted it with respect though they didn't in the least like the bitter flavour but the invalid was greatly invigorated by it and warrington pronounced it superlatively good and proposed the major's health in a mock speech after dinner on the first day when the wine was served and that of lord steyne and the aristocracy in general <\s>
<s> major pendennis returned thanks with the utmost gravity and in a speech in which he used the words the present occasion at least the proper number of times <\s>

<s> everybody was kindly disposed towards the sick man and his family <\s>

<s> let pen's biographer be pardoned for alluding to a time not far distant when a somewhat similar mishap brought him a providential friend a kind physician and a thousand proofs of a most touching and surprising kindness and sympathy <\s>
<s> there was a piano in mr <\s>

<s> whilst such business as this was going on within a rather shabby old gentleman would come and lead away the pale girl in the black bonnet who had no right to be abroad in the night air and the temple porters the few laundresses and other amateurs who had been listening to the concert would also disappear <\s>

<s> laura looked at warrington with the archest sparkle in her eyes warrington fairly burst out into a boohoo of laughter even the widow was obliged to laugh and the major erubescent confounded the impudence of the young folks and said when he had his hair cut he would keep a lock of it for miss laura <\s>

<s> warrington and miss bell got some flowers off the ladies bonnets and made a wreath with which they decorated the wig and brought it out in procession and did homage before it <\s>
<s> in fact they indulged in a hundred sports jularities waggeries and petits jeux innocens so that the second and third floors of number 6 lamb court temple rang with more cheerfulness and laughter than had been known in those precincts for many a long day <\s>
<s> at last after about ten days of this life one evening when the little spy of the court came out to take her usual post of observation at the lamp there was no music from the second floor window there were no lights in the third story chambers the windows of each were open and the occupants were gone <\s>

<s> the antique travelling chariot was brought out again and cushioned with many pillows for pen and his mother and miss laura went in the most affable manner in the omnibus under the guardianship of mr <\s>

<s> the widow had left a jar full of flowers upon his table prettily arranged and when he entered they filled the solitary room with odour <\s>
<s> they were memorials of the kind gentle souls who had gone away and who had decorated for a little while that lonely cheerless place <\s>
<s> he had had the happiest days of his whole life george felt he knew it now they were just gone he went and took up the flowers and put his face to them and smelt them perhaps kissed them <\s>
<s> as he put them down he rubbed his rough hand across his eyes with a bitter word and laugh <\s>
<s> the women had spoiled him as we like them and as they like to do <\s>
<s> they had cloyed him with obedience and surfeited him with sweet respect and submission until he grew weary of the slaves who waited upon him and their caresses and cajoleries excited him no more <\s>

<s> he wears a beard and he likes his women to be slaves <\s>
<s> what man would be henpecked i say <\s>

<s> well then arthur being so languid and indifferent and careless about the favours bestowed upon him how came it that laura should have such a love and rapturous regard for him that a mere inadequate expression of it should have kept the girl talking all the way from fairoaks to london as she and helen travelled in the post chaise <\s>
<s> as soon as helen had finished one story about the dear fellow and narrated with a hundred sobs and ejaculations and looks up to heaven some thrilling incidents which occurred about the period when the hero was breeched laura began another equally interesting and equally ornamented with tears and told how heroically he had a tooth out or wouldn't have it out or how daringly he robbed a bird's nest or how magnanimously he spared it or how he gave a shilling to the old woman on the common or went without his bread and butter for the beggar boy who came into the yard and so on one to another the sobbing women sang laments upon their hero who my worthy reader has long since perceived is no more a hero than one of us <\s>
<s> being as he was why should a sensible girl be so fond of him <\s>
<s> this point has been argued before in a previous unfortunate sentence which lately drew down all the wrath of ireland upon the writer's head and which said that the greatest rascal cut throats have had somebody to be fond of them and if those monsters why not ordinary mortals <\s>
<s> and with whom shall a young lady fall in love but with the person she sees <\s>
<s> she is not supposed to lose her heart in a dream like a princess in the arabian nights or to plight her young affections to the portrait of a gentleman in the exhibition or a sketch in the illustrated london news <\s>
<s> you have an instinct within you which inclines you to attach yourself to some one you meet somebody you hear somebody constantly praised you walk or ride or waltz or talk or sit in the same pew at church with somebody you meet again and again and marriages are made in heave your dear mamma says pinning your orange flowers wreath on with her blessed eyes dimmed with tears and there is a wedding breakfast and you take off your white satin and retire to your coach and four and you and he are a happy pair or the affair is broken off and then poor wounded heart <\s>
<s> why then you meet somebody else and twine your young affections round number two <\s>
<s> it is your nature so to do <\s>
<s> do you suppose it is all for the man's sake that you love and not a bit for your own <\s>
<s> do you suppose you would drink if you were not thirsty or eat if you were not hungry <\s>
<s> so then laura liked pen because she saw scarcely anybody else at fairoaks except doctor portman and captain glanders and because his mother constantly praised her arthur and because he was gentlemanlike tolerably good looking and witty and because above all it was of her nature to like somebody <\s>
<s> and having once received this image into her heart she there tenderly nursed it and clasped it she there in his long absences and her constant solitudes silently brooded over it and fondled it and when after this she came to london and had an opportunity of becoming rather intimate with mr <\s>

<s> whilst such business as this was going on within a rather shabby old gentleman would come and lead away the pale girl in the black bonnet who had no right to be abroad in the night air and the temple porters the few laundresses and other amateurs who had been listening to the concert would also disappear <\s>

<s> warrington and miss bell got some flowers off the ladies bonnets and made a wreath with which they decorated the wig and brought it out in procession and did homage before it <\s>

<s> the widow had left a jar full of flowers upon his table prettily arranged and when he entered they filled the solitary room with odour <\s>
<s> they were memorials of the kind gentle souls who had gone away and who had decorated for a little while that lonely cheerless place <\s>
<s> he had had the happiest days of his whole life george felt he knew it now they were just gone he went and took up the flowers and put his face to them and smelt them perhaps kissed them <\s>
<s> as he put them down he rubbed his rough hand across his eyes with a bitter word and laugh <\s>
<s> the women had spoiled him as we like them and as they like to do <\s>

<s> he wears a beard and he likes his women to be slaves <\s>
<s> what man would be henpecked i say <\s>

<s> well then arthur being so languid and indifferent and careless about the favours bestowed upon him how came it that laura should have such a love and rapturous regard for him that a mere inadequate expression of it should have kept the girl talking all the way from fairoaks to london as she and helen travelled in the post chaise <\s>
<s> as soon as helen had finished one story about the dear fellow and narrated with a hundred sobs and ejaculations and looks up to heaven some thrilling incidents which occurred about the period when the hero was breeched laura began another equally interesting and equally ornamented with tears and told how heroically he had a tooth out or wouldn't have it out or how daringly he robbed a bird's nest or how magnanimously he spared it or how he gave a shilling to the old woman on the common or went without his bread and butter for the beggar boy who came into the yard and so on one to another the sobbing women sang laments upon their hero who my worthy reader has long since perceived is no more a hero than one of us <\s>
<s> being as he was why should a sensible girl be so fond of him <\s>
<s> this point has been argued before in a previous unfortunate sentence which lately drew down all the wrath of ireland upon the writer's head and which said that the greatest rascal cut throats have had somebody to be fond of them and if those monsters why not ordinary mortals <\s>
<s> and with whom shall a young lady fall in love but with the person she sees <\s>
<s> she is not supposed to lose her heart in a dream like a princess in the arabian nights or to plight her young affections to the portrait of a gentleman in the exhibition or a sketch in the illustrated london news <\s>
<s> you have an instinct within you which inclines you to attach yourself to some one you meet somebody you hear somebody constantly praised you walk or ride or waltz or talk or sit in the same pew at church with somebody you meet again and again and marriages are made in heave your dear mamma says pinning your orange flowers wreath on with her blessed eyes dimmed with tears and there is a wedding breakfast and you take off your white satin and retire to your coach and four and you and he are a happy pair or the affair is broken off and then poor wounded heart <\s>
<s> why then you meet somebody else and twine your young affections round number two <\s>
<s> it is your nature so to do <\s>
<s> do you suppose it is all for the man's sake that you love and not a bit for your own <\s>
<s> do you suppose you would drink if you were not thirsty or eat if you were not hungry <\s>
<s> so then laura liked pen because she saw scarcely anybody else at fairoaks except doctor portman and captain glanders and because his mother constantly praised her arthur and because he was gentlemanlike tolerably good looking and witty and because above all it was of her nature to like somebody <\s>
<s> and having once received this image into her heart she there tenderly nursed it and clasped it she there in his long absences and her constant solitudes silently brooded over it and fondled it and when after this she came to london and had an opportunity of becoming rather intimate with mr <\s>
<s> george warrington what on earth was to prevent her from thinking him a most odd original agreeable and pleasing person <\s>
<s> a long time afterwards when these days were over and fate in its own way had disposed of the various persons now assembled in the dingy building in lamb court perhaps some of them looked back and thought how happy the time was and how pleasant had been their evening talks and little walks and simple recreations round the sofa of pen the convalescent <\s>
<s> the major had a favourable opinion of september in london from that time forward and declared at his clubs and in society that the dead season in town was often pleasant doosid pleasant begad <\s>
<s> he used to go home to his lodgings in bury street of a night wondering that it was already so late and that the evening had passed away so quickly <\s>
<s> he made his appearance at the temple pretty constantly in the afternoon and tugged up the long black staircase with quite a benevolent activity and perseverance <\s>

<s> and the permission to drink a glass or two of pure sherry being accorded to pen by doctor goodenough the major told with almost tears in his eyes how his noble friend the marquis of steyne passing through london on his way to the continent had ordered any quantity of his precious his priceless amontillado that had been a present from king ferdinand to the noble marquis to be placed at the disposal of mr <\s>
<s> the widow and laura tasted it with respect though they didn't in the least like the bitter flavour but the invalid was greatly invigorated by it and warrington pronounced it superlatively good and proposed the major's health in a mock speech after dinner on the first day when the wine was served and that of lord steyne and the aristocracy in general <\s>

<s> the widow had left a jar full of flowers upon his table prettily arranged and when he entered they filled the solitary room with odour <\s>

<s> what man would be henpecked i say <\s>

<s> well then arthur being so languid and indifferent and careless about the favours bestowed upon him how came it that laura should have such a love and rapturous regard for him that a mere inadequate expression of it should have kept the girl talking all the way from fairoaks to london as she and helen travelled in the post chaise <\s>
<s> as soon as helen had finished one story about the dear fellow and narrated with a hundred sobs and ejaculations and looks up to heaven some thrilling incidents which occurred about the period when the hero was breeched laura began another equally interesting and equally ornamented with tears and told how heroically he had a tooth out or wouldn't have it out or how daringly he robbed a bird's nest or how magnanimously he spared it or how he gave a shilling to the old woman on the common or went without his bread and butter for the beggar boy who came into the yard and so on one to another the sobbing women sang laments upon their hero who my worthy reader has long since perceived is no more a hero than one of us <\s>
<s> being as he was why should a sensible girl be so fond of him <\s>
<s> this point has been argued before in a previous unfortunate sentence which lately drew down all the wrath of ireland upon the writer's head and which said that the greatest rascal cut throats have had somebody to be fond of them and if those monsters why not ordinary mortals <\s>
<s> and with whom shall a young lady fall in love but with the person she sees <\s>
<s> she is not supposed to lose her heart in a dream like a princess in the arabian nights or to plight her young affections to the portrait of a gentleman in the exhibition or a sketch in the illustrated london news <\s>
<s> you have an instinct within you which inclines you to attach yourself to some one you meet somebody you hear somebody constantly praised you walk or ride or waltz or talk or sit in the same pew at church with somebody you meet again and again and marriages are made in heave your dear mamma says pinning your orange flowers wreath on with her blessed eyes dimmed with tears and there is a wedding breakfast and you take off your white satin and retire to your coach and four and you and he are a happy pair or the affair is broken off and then poor wounded heart <\s>
<s> why then you meet somebody else and twine your young affections round number two <\s>
<s> it is your nature so to do <\s>
<s> do you suppose it is all for the man's sake that you love and not a bit for your own <\s>
<s> do you suppose you would drink if you were not thirsty or eat if you were not hungry <\s>
<s> so then laura liked pen because she saw scarcely anybody else at fairoaks except doctor portman and captain glanders and because his mother constantly praised her arthur and because he was gentlemanlike tolerably good looking and witty and because above all it was of her nature to like somebody <\s>
<s> and having once received this image into her heart she there tenderly nursed it and clasped it she there in his long absences and her constant solitudes silently brooded over it and fondled it and when after this she came to london and had an opportunity of becoming rather intimate with mr <\s>
<s> george warrington what on earth was to prevent her from thinking him a most odd original agreeable and pleasing person <\s>
<s> a long time afterwards when these days were over and fate in its own way had disposed of the various persons now assembled in the dingy building in lamb court perhaps some of them looked back and thought how happy the time was and how pleasant had been their evening talks and little walks and simple recreations round the sofa of pen the convalescent <\s>
<s> the major had a favourable opinion of september in london from that time forward and declared at his clubs and in society that the dead season in town was often pleasant doosid pleasant begad <\s>
<s> he used to go home to his lodgings in bury street of a night wondering that it was already so late and that the evening had passed away so quickly <\s>
<s> he made his appearance at the temple pretty constantly in the afternoon and tugged up the long black staircase with quite a benevolent activity and perseverance <\s>
<s> and he made interest with the chef at bays's that renowned cook the superintendence of whose work upon gastronomy compelled the gifted author to stay in the metropolis to prepare little jellies delicate clear soups aspics and other trifles good for invalids which morgan the valet constantly brought down to the little lamb court colony <\s>
<s> and the permission to drink a glass or two of pure sherry being accorded to pen by doctor goodenough the major told with almost tears in his eyes how his noble friend the marquis of steyne passing through london on his way to the continent had ordered any quantity of his precious his priceless amontillado that had been a present from king ferdinand to the noble marquis to be placed at the disposal of mr <\s>
<s> the widow and laura tasted it with respect though they didn't in the least like the bitter flavour but the invalid was greatly invigorated by it and warrington pronounced it superlatively good and proposed the major's health in a mock speech after dinner on the first day when the wine was served and that of lord steyne and the aristocracy in general <\s>
<s> major pendennis returned thanks with the utmost gravity and in a speech in which he used the words the present occasion at least the proper number of times <\s>
<s> pen cheered with his feeble voice from his armchair <\s>
<s> warrington taught miss laura to cry hear <\s>
<s> and tapped the table with his knuckles <\s>
<s> pidgeon the attendant grinned and honest doctor goodenough found the party so merrily engaged when he came in to pay his faithful gratuitous visit <\s>
<s> warrington knew sibwright who lived below and that gallant gentleman in reply to a letter informing him of the use to which his apartment had been put wrote back the most polite and flowery letter of acquiescence he placed his chambers at the service of their fair occupants his bed at their disposal his carpets at their feet <\s>
<s> everybody was kindly disposed towards the sick man and his family <\s>
<s> his heart and his mother's too as we may fancy melted within him at the thought of so much good feeling and good nature <\s>
<s> let pen's biographer be pardoned for alluding to a time not far distant when a somewhat similar mishap brought him a providential friend a kind physician and a thousand proofs of a most touching and surprising kindness and sympathy <\s>
<s> there was a piano in mr <\s>
<s> sibwright's chamber indeed this gentleman a lover of all the arts performed himself and excellently ill too upon the instrument and had had a song dedicated to him the words by himself the air by his devoted friend leopoldo twankidillo and at this music box as mr <\s>
<s> warrington called it laura at first with a great deal of tremor and blushing which became her very much played and sang sometimes of an evening simple airs and old songs of home <\s>
<s> her voice was a rich contralto and warrington who scarcely knew one tune from another and who had but one tune or bray in his repertoire a most discordant imitation of god save the king' sat rapt in delight listening to these songs <\s>
<s> he could follow their rhythm if not their harmony and he could watch with a constant and daily growing enthusiasm the pure and tender and generous creature who made the music <\s>
<s> i wonder how that poor pale little girl in the black bonnet who used to stand at the lamp post in lamb court sometimes of an evening looking up to the open windows from which the music came liked to hear it <\s>

<s> the widow had left a jar full of flowers upon his table prettily arranged and when he entered they filled the solitary room with odour <\s>
<s> they were memorials of the kind gentle souls who had gone away and who had decorated for a little while that lonely cheerless place <\s>

<s> he wears a beard and he likes his women to be slaves <\s>
<s> what man would be henpecked i say <\s>

<s> well then arthur being so languid and indifferent and careless about the favours bestowed upon him how came it that laura should have such a love and rapturous regard for him that a mere inadequate expression of it should have kept the girl talking all the way from fairoaks to london as she and helen travelled in the post chaise <\s>
<s> as soon as helen had finished one story about the dear fellow and narrated with a hundred sobs and ejaculations and looks up to heaven some thrilling incidents which occurred about the period when the hero was breeched laura began another equally interesting and equally ornamented with tears and told how heroically he had a tooth out or wouldn't have it out or how daringly he robbed a bird's nest or how magnanimously he spared it or how he gave a shilling to the old woman on the common or went without his bread and butter for the beggar boy who came into the yard and so on one to another the sobbing women sang laments upon their hero who my worthy reader has long since perceived is no more a hero than one of us <\s>
<s> being as he was why should a sensible girl be so fond of him <\s>
<s> this point has been argued before in a previous unfortunate sentence which lately drew down all the wrath of ireland upon the writer's head and which said that the greatest rascal cut throats have had somebody to be fond of them and if those monsters why not ordinary mortals <\s>
<s> and with whom shall a young lady fall in love but with the person she sees <\s>
<s> she is not supposed to lose her heart in a dream like a princess in the arabian nights or to plight her young affections to the portrait of a gentleman in the exhibition or a sketch in the illustrated london news <\s>
<s> you have an instinct within you which inclines you to attach yourself to some one you meet somebody you hear somebody constantly praised you walk or ride or waltz or talk or sit in the same pew at church with somebody you meet again and again and marriages are made in heave your dear mamma says pinning your orange flowers wreath on with her blessed eyes dimmed with tears and there is a wedding breakfast and you take off your white satin and retire to your coach and four and you and he are a happy pair or the affair is broken off and then poor wounded heart <\s>
<s> why then you meet somebody else and twine your young affections round number two <\s>
<s> it is your nature so to do <\s>
<s> do you suppose it is all for the man's sake that you love and not a bit for your own <\s>
<s> do you suppose you would drink if you were not thirsty or eat if you were not hungry <\s>
<s> so then laura liked pen because she saw scarcely anybody else at fairoaks except doctor portman and captain glanders and because his mother constantly praised her arthur and because he was gentlemanlike tolerably good looking and witty and because above all it was of her nature to like somebody <\s>
<s> and having once received this image into her heart she there tenderly nursed it and clasped it she there in his long absences and her constant solitudes silently brooded over it and fondled it and when after this she came to london and had an opportunity of becoming rather intimate with mr <\s>
<s> george warrington what on earth was to prevent her from thinking him a most odd original agreeable and pleasing person <\s>
<s> a long time afterwards when these days were over and fate in its own way had disposed of the various persons now assembled in the dingy building in lamb court perhaps some of them looked back and thought how happy the time was and how pleasant had been their evening talks and little walks and simple recreations round the sofa of pen the convalescent <\s>
<s> the major had a favourable opinion of september in london from that time forward and declared at his clubs and in society that the dead season in town was often pleasant doosid pleasant begad <\s>
<s> he used to go home to his lodgings in bury street of a night wondering that it was already so late and that the evening had passed away so quickly <\s>
<s> he made his appearance at the temple pretty constantly in the afternoon and tugged up the long black staircase with quite a benevolent activity and perseverance <\s>
<s> and he made interest with the chef at bays's that renowned cook the superintendence of whose work upon gastronomy compelled the gifted author to stay in the metropolis to prepare little jellies delicate clear soups aspics and other trifles good for invalids which morgan the valet constantly brought down to the little lamb court colony <\s>
<s> and the permission to drink a glass or two of pure sherry being accorded to pen by doctor goodenough the major told with almost tears in his eyes how his noble friend the marquis of steyne passing through london on his way to the continent had ordered any quantity of his precious his priceless amontillado that had been a present from king ferdinand to the noble marquis to be placed at the disposal of mr <\s>
<s> the widow and laura tasted it with respect though they didn't in the least like the bitter flavour but the invalid was greatly invigorated by it and warrington pronounced it superlatively good and proposed the major's health in a mock speech after dinner on the first day when the wine was served and that of lord steyne and the aristocracy in general <\s>
<s> major pendennis returned thanks with the utmost gravity and in a speech in which he used the words the present occasion at least the proper number of times <\s>
<s> pen cheered with his feeble voice from his armchair <\s>
<s> warrington taught miss laura to cry hear <\s>
<s> and tapped the table with his knuckles <\s>
<s> pidgeon the attendant grinned and honest doctor goodenough found the party so merrily engaged when he came in to pay his faithful gratuitous visit <\s>
<s> warrington knew sibwright who lived below and that gallant gentleman in reply to a letter informing him of the use to which his apartment had been put wrote back the most polite and flowery letter of acquiescence he placed his chambers at the service of their fair occupants his bed at their disposal his carpets at their feet <\s>
<s> everybody was kindly disposed towards the sick man and his family <\s>
<s> his heart and his mother's too as we may fancy melted within him at the thought of so much good feeling and good nature <\s>
<s> let pen's biographer be pardoned for alluding to a time not far distant when a somewhat similar mishap brought him a providential friend a kind physician and a thousand proofs of a most touching and surprising kindness and sympathy <\s>
<s> there was a piano in mr <\s>
<s> sibwright's chamber indeed this gentleman a lover of all the arts performed himself and excellently ill too upon the instrument and had had a song dedicated to him the words by himself the air by his devoted friend leopoldo twankidillo and at this music box as mr <\s>
<s> warrington called it laura at first with a great deal of tremor and blushing which became her very much played and sang sometimes of an evening simple airs and old songs of home <\s>
<s> her voice was a rich contralto and warrington who scarcely knew one tune from another and who had but one tune or bray in his repertoire a most discordant imitation of god save the king' sat rapt in delight listening to these songs <\s>
<s> he could follow their rhythm if not their harmony and he could watch with a constant and daily growing enthusiasm the pure and tender and generous creature who made the music <\s>
<s> i wonder how that poor pale little girl in the black bonnet who used to stand at the lamp post in lamb court sometimes of an evening looking up to the open windows from which the music came liked to hear it <\s>
<s> when pen's bedtime came the songs were hushed <\s>
<s> lights appeared in the upper room his room whither the widow used to conduct him and then the major and mr <\s>
<s> warrington and sometimes miss laura would have a game at ecarte or backgammon or she would sit by working a pair of slippers in worsted a pair of gentleman's slippers they might have been for arthur or for george or for major pendennis one of those three would have given anything for the slippers <\s>
<s> whilst such business as this was going on within a rather shabby old gentleman would come and lead away the pale girl in the black bonnet who had no right to be abroad in the night air and the temple porters the few laundresses and other amateurs who had been listening to the concert would also disappear <\s>
<s> just before ten o'clock there was another musical performance namely that of the chimes of st <\s>

<s> as they were ringing laura began to fold up the slippers martha from fairoaks appeared with a bed candle and a constant smile on her face the major said god bless my soul is it so late <\s>
<s> warrington and he left their unfinished game and got up and shook hands with miss bell <\s>
<s> martha from fairoaks lighted them out of the passage and down the stair and as they descended they could hear her bolting and locking the sporting door after them upon her young mistress and herself <\s>
<s> if there had been any danger grinning martha said she would have got down that thar hooky soord which hung up in gantleman's room meaning the damascus scimitar with the names of the prophet engraved on the blade and the red velvet scabbard which percy sibwright esquire brought back from his tour in the levant along with an albanian dress and which he wore with such elegant effect at lady mullingar's fancy ball gloucester square hyde park <\s>

<s> well then arthur being so languid and indifferent and careless about the favours bestowed upon him how came it that laura should have such a love and rapturous regard for him that a mere inadequate expression of it should have kept the girl talking all the way from fairoaks to london as she and helen travelled in the post chaise <\s>
<s> as soon as helen had finished one story about the dear fellow and narrated with a hundred sobs and ejaculations and looks up to heaven some thrilling incidents which occurred about the period when the hero was breeched laura began another equally interesting and equally ornamented with tears and told how heroically he had a tooth out or wouldn't have it out or how daringly he robbed a bird's nest or how magnanimously he spared it or how he gave a shilling to the old woman on the common or went without his bread and butter for the beggar boy who came into the yard and so on one to another the sobbing women sang laments upon their hero who my worthy reader has long since perceived is no more a hero than one of us <\s>
<s> being as he was why should a sensible girl be so fond of him <\s>
<s> this point has been argued before in a previous unfortunate sentence which lately drew down all the wrath of ireland upon the writer's head and which said that the greatest rascal cut throats have had somebody to be fond of them and if those monsters why not ordinary mortals <\s>
<s> and with whom shall a young lady fall in love but with the person she sees <\s>
<s> she is not supposed to lose her heart in a dream like a princess in the arabian nights or to plight her young affections to the portrait of a gentleman in the exhibition or a sketch in the illustrated london news <\s>
<s> you have an instinct within you which inclines you to attach yourself to some one you meet somebody you hear somebody constantly praised you walk or ride or waltz or talk or sit in the same pew at church with somebody you meet again and again and marriages are made in heave your dear mamma says pinning your orange flowers wreath on with her blessed eyes dimmed with tears and there is a wedding breakfast and you take off your white satin and retire to your coach and four and you and he are a happy pair or the affair is broken off and then poor wounded heart <\s>

<s> do you suppose it is all for the man's sake that you love and not a bit for your own <\s>

<s> so then laura liked pen because she saw scarcely anybody else at fairoaks except doctor portman and captain glanders and because his mother constantly praised her arthur and because he was gentlemanlike tolerably good looking and witty and because above all it was of her nature to like somebody <\s>
<s> and having once received this image into her heart she there tenderly nursed it and clasped it she there in his long absences and her constant solitudes silently brooded over it and fondled it and when after this she came to london and had an opportunity of becoming rather intimate with mr <\s>

<s> a long time afterwards when these days were over and fate in its own way had disposed of the various persons now assembled in the dingy building in lamb court perhaps some of them looked back and thought how happy the time was and how pleasant had been their evening talks and little walks and simple recreations round the sofa of pen the convalescent <\s>
<s> the major had a favourable opinion of september in london from that time forward and declared at his clubs and in society that the dead season in town was often pleasant doosid pleasant begad <\s>

<s> and the permission to drink a glass or two of pure sherry being accorded to pen by doctor goodenough the major told with almost tears in his eyes how his noble friend the marquis of steyne passing through london on his way to the continent had ordered any quantity of his precious his priceless amontillado that had been a present from king ferdinand to the noble marquis to be placed at the disposal of mr <\s>
<s> the widow and laura tasted it with respect though they didn't in the least like the bitter flavour but the invalid was greatly invigorated by it and warrington pronounced it superlatively good and proposed the major's health in a mock speech after dinner on the first day when the wine was served and that of lord steyne and the aristocracy in general <\s>
<s> major pendennis returned thanks with the utmost gravity and in a speech in which he used the words the present occasion at least the proper number of times <\s>

<s> everybody was kindly disposed towards the sick man and his family <\s>
<s> his heart and his mother's too as we may fancy melted within him at the thought of so much good feeling and good nature <\s>
<s> let pen's biographer be pardoned for alluding to a time not far distant when a somewhat similar mishap brought him a providential friend a kind physician and a thousand proofs of a most touching and surprising kindness and sympathy <\s>
<s> there was a piano in mr <\s>

<s> i wonder how that poor pale little girl in the black bonnet who used to stand at the lamp post in lamb court sometimes of an evening looking up to the open windows from which the music came liked to hear it <\s>

<s> well then arthur being so languid and indifferent and careless about the favours bestowed upon him how came it that laura should have such a love and rapturous regard for him that a mere inadequate expression of it should have kept the girl talking all the way from fairoaks to london as she and helen travelled in the post chaise <\s>
<s> as soon as helen had finished one story about the dear fellow and narrated with a hundred sobs and ejaculations and looks up to heaven some thrilling incidents which occurred about the period when the hero was breeched laura began another equally interesting and equally ornamented with tears and told how heroically he had a tooth out or wouldn't have it out or how daringly he robbed a bird's nest or how magnanimously he spared it or how he gave a shilling to the old woman on the common or went without his bread and butter for the beggar boy who came into the yard and so on one to another the sobbing women sang laments upon their hero who my worthy reader has long since perceived is no more a hero than one of us <\s>
<s> being as he was why should a sensible girl be so fond of him <\s>
<s> this point has been argued before in a previous unfortunate sentence which lately drew down all the wrath of ireland upon the writer's head and which said that the greatest rascal cut throats have had somebody to be fond of them and if those monsters why not ordinary mortals <\s>
<s> and with whom shall a young lady fall in love but with the person she sees <\s>
<s> she is not supposed to lose her heart in a dream like a princess in the arabian nights or to plight her young affections to the portrait of a gentleman in the exhibition or a sketch in the illustrated london news <\s>
<s> you have an instinct within you which inclines you to attach yourself to some one you meet somebody you hear somebody constantly praised you walk or ride or waltz or talk or sit in the same pew at church with somebody you meet again and again and marriages are made in heave your dear mamma says pinning your orange flowers wreath on with her blessed eyes dimmed with tears and there is a wedding breakfast and you take off your white satin and retire to your coach and four and you and he are a happy pair or the affair is broken off and then poor wounded heart <\s>
<s> why then you meet somebody else and twine your young affections round number two <\s>
<s> it is your nature so to do <\s>
<s> do you suppose it is all for the man's sake that you love and not a bit for your own <\s>
<s> do you suppose you would drink if you were not thirsty or eat if you were not hungry <\s>
<s> so then laura liked pen because she saw scarcely anybody else at fairoaks except doctor portman and captain glanders and because his mother constantly praised her arthur and because he was gentlemanlike tolerably good looking and witty and because above all it was of her nature to like somebody <\s>
<s> and having once received this image into her heart she there tenderly nursed it and clasped it she there in his long absences and her constant solitudes silently brooded over it and fondled it and when after this she came to london and had an opportunity of becoming rather intimate with mr <\s>

<s> a long time afterwards when these days were over and fate in its own way had disposed of the various persons now assembled in the dingy building in lamb court perhaps some of them looked back and thought how happy the time was and how pleasant had been their evening talks and little walks and simple recreations round the sofa of pen the convalescent <\s>

<s> and the permission to drink a glass or two of pure sherry being accorded to pen by doctor goodenough the major told with almost tears in his eyes how his noble friend the marquis of steyne passing through london on his way to the continent had ordered any quantity of his precious his priceless amontillado that had been a present from king ferdinand to the noble marquis to be placed at the disposal of mr <\s>
<s> the widow and laura tasted it with respect though they didn't in the least like the bitter flavour but the invalid was greatly invigorated by it and warrington pronounced it superlatively good and proposed the major's health in a mock speech after dinner on the first day when the wine was served and that of lord steyne and the aristocracy in general <\s>
<s> major pendennis returned thanks with the utmost gravity and in a speech in which he used the words the present occasion at least the proper number of times <\s>

<s> everybody was kindly disposed towards the sick man and his family <\s>

<s> let pen's biographer be pardoned for alluding to a time not far distant when a somewhat similar mishap brought him a providential friend a kind physician and a thousand proofs of a most touching and surprising kindness and sympathy <\s>
<s> there was a piano in mr <\s>

<s> the major had a favourable opinion of september in london from that time forward and declared at his clubs and in society that the dead season in town was often pleasant doosid pleasant begad <\s>
<s> he used to go home to his lodgings in bury street of a night wondering that it was already so late and that the evening had passed away so quickly <\s>
<s> he made his appearance at the temple pretty constantly in the afternoon and tugged up the long black staircase with quite a benevolent activity and perseverance <\s>
<s> and he made interest with the chef at bays's that renowned cook the superintendence of whose work upon gastronomy compelled the gifted author to stay in the metropolis to prepare little jellies delicate clear soups aspics and other trifles good for invalids which morgan the valet constantly brought down to the little lamb court colony <\s>
<s> and the permission to drink a glass or two of pure sherry being accorded to pen by doctor goodenough the major told with almost tears in his eyes how his noble friend the marquis of steyne passing through london on his way to the continent had ordered any quantity of his precious his priceless amontillado that had been a present from king ferdinand to the noble marquis to be placed at the disposal of mr <\s>
<s> the widow and laura tasted it with respect though they didn't in the least like the bitter flavour but the invalid was greatly invigorated by it and warrington pronounced it superlatively good and proposed the major's health in a mock speech after dinner on the first day when the wine was served and that of lord steyne and the aristocracy in general <\s>
<s> major pendennis returned thanks with the utmost gravity and in a speech in which he used the words the present occasion at least the proper number of times <\s>
<s> pen cheered with his feeble voice from his armchair <\s>
<s> warrington taught miss laura to cry hear <\s>
<s> and tapped the table with his knuckles <\s>
<s> pidgeon the attendant grinned and honest doctor goodenough found the party so merrily engaged when he came in to pay his faithful gratuitous visit <\s>
<s> warrington knew sibwright who lived below and that gallant gentleman in reply to a letter informing him of the use to which his apartment had been put wrote back the most polite and flowery letter of acquiescence he placed his chambers at the service of their fair occupants his bed at their disposal his carpets at their feet <\s>
<s> everybody was kindly disposed towards the sick man and his family <\s>
<s> his heart and his mother's too as we may fancy melted within him at the thought of so much good feeling and good nature <\s>
<s> let pen's biographer be pardoned for alluding to a time not far distant when a somewhat similar mishap brought him a providential friend a kind physician and a thousand proofs of a most touching and surprising kindness and sympathy <\s>
<s> there was a piano in mr <\s>
<s> sibwright's chamber indeed this gentleman a lover of all the arts performed himself and excellently ill too upon the instrument and had had a song dedicated to him the words by himself the air by his devoted friend leopoldo twankidillo and at this music box as mr <\s>
<s> warrington called it laura at first with a great deal of tremor and blushing which became her very much played and sang sometimes of an evening simple airs and old songs of home <\s>
<s> her voice was a rich contralto and warrington who scarcely knew one tune from another and who had but one tune or bray in his repertoire a most discordant imitation of god save the king' sat rapt in delight listening to these songs <\s>
<s> he could follow their rhythm if not their harmony and he could watch with a constant and daily growing enthusiasm the pure and tender and generous creature who made the music <\s>
<s> i wonder how that poor pale little girl in the black bonnet who used to stand at the lamp post in lamb court sometimes of an evening looking up to the open windows from which the music came liked to hear it <\s>
<s> when pen's bedtime came the songs were hushed <\s>
<s> lights appeared in the upper room his room whither the widow used to conduct him and then the major and mr <\s>
<s> warrington and sometimes miss laura would have a game at ecarte or backgammon or she would sit by working a pair of slippers in worsted a pair of gentleman's slippers they might have been for arthur or for george or for major pendennis one of those three would have given anything for the slippers <\s>
<s> whilst such business as this was going on within a rather shabby old gentleman would come and lead away the pale girl in the black bonnet who had no right to be abroad in the night air and the temple porters the few laundresses and other amateurs who had been listening to the concert would also disappear <\s>
<s> just before ten o'clock there was another musical performance namely that of the chimes of st <\s>
<s> clement's clock in the strand which played the clear cheerful notes of a psalm before it proceeded to ring its ten fatal strokes <\s>
<s> as they were ringing laura began to fold up the slippers martha from fairoaks appeared with a bed candle and a constant smile on her face the major said god bless my soul is it so late <\s>
<s> warrington and he left their unfinished game and got up and shook hands with miss bell <\s>
<s> martha from fairoaks lighted them out of the passage and down the stair and as they descended they could hear her bolting and locking the sporting door after them upon her young mistress and herself <\s>
<s> if there had been any danger grinning martha said she would have got down that thar hooky soord which hung up in gantleman's room meaning the damascus scimitar with the names of the prophet engraved on the blade and the red velvet scabbard which percy sibwright esquire brought back from his tour in the levant along with an albanian dress and which he wore with such elegant effect at lady mullingar's fancy ball gloucester square hyde park <\s>
<s> it entangled itself in miss kewsey's train who appeared in the dress in which she with her mamma had been presented to their sovereign the latter by the l d ch nc ll r's lady and led to events which have nothing to do with this history <\s>
<s> is not miss kewsey now mrs <\s>
<s> has sibwright not got a county court good night laura and fairoaks martha <\s>
<s> sleep well and wake happy pure and gentle lady <\s>
<s> sometimes after these evenings warrington would walk a little way with major pendennis just a little way just as far as the temple gate as the strand as charing cross as the club he was not going into the club <\s>
<s> well as far as bury street where he would laughingly shake hands on the major's own door step <\s>
<s> they had been talking about laura all the way <\s>
<s> it was wonderful how enthusiastic the major who as we know used to dislike her had grown to be regarding the young lady dev'lish fine girl begad <\s>
<s> dev'lish well mannered girl my sister in law has the manners of a duchess and would bring up any girl well <\s>
<s> miss bell's a little countryfied <\s>
<s> but the smell of the hawthorn is pleasant demmy <\s>
<s> your london girls would give many a guinea for a bouquet like that natural flowers begad <\s>
<s> and she's a little money too nothing to speak of but a pooty little bit of money <\s>
<s> in all which opinions no doubt mr <\s>
<s> warrington agreed and though he laughed as he shook hands with the major his face fell as he left his veteran companion and he strode back to chambers and smoked pipe after pipe long into the night and wrote article upon article more and more savage in lieu of friend pen disabled <\s>
<s> well it was a happy time for almost all parties concerned <\s>
<s> sleeping and eating were his constant occupations <\s>
<s> his appetite was something frightful <\s>
<s> he was ashamed of exhibiting it before laura and almost before his mother who laughed and applauded him <\s>
<s> as the roast chicken of his dinner went away he eyed the departing friend with sad longing and began to long for jelly or tea or what not <\s>
<s> he was like an ogre in devouring <\s>
<s> the doctor cried stop but pen would not <\s>
<s> nature called out to him more loudly than the doctor and that kind and friendly physician handed him over with a very good grace to the other healer <\s>
<s> and here let us speak very tenderly and in the strictest confidence of an event which befell him and to which he never liked an allusion <\s>
<s> during his delirium the ruthless goodenough ordered ice to be put to his head and all his lovely hair to be cut <\s>
<s> it was done in the time of of the other nurse who left every single hair of course in a paper for the widow to count and treasure up <\s>
<s> she never believed but that the girl had taken away some of it but then women are so suspicious upon these matters <\s>
<s> when this direful loss was made visible to major pendennis as of course it was the first time the elder saw the poor young man's shorn pate and when pen was quite out of danger and gaining daily vigour the major with something like blushes and a queer wink of his eyes said he knew of a a person a coiffeur in fact a good man whom he would send down to the temple and who would a apply a a temporary remedy to that misfortune <\s>
<s> laura looked at warrington with the archest sparkle in her eyes warrington fairly burst out into a boohoo of laughter even the widow was obliged to laugh and the major erubescent confounded the impudence of the young folks and said when he had his hair cut he would keep a lock of it for miss laura <\s>
<s> warrington voted that pen should wear a barrister's wig <\s>
<s> there was sibwright's down below which would become him hugely <\s>
<s> pen said stuff and seemed as confused as his uncle and the end was that a gentleman from burlington arcade waited next day upon mr <\s>
<s> pendennis and had a private interview with him in his bedroom and a week afterwards the same individual appeared with a box under his arm and an ineffable grin of politeness on his face and announced that he had brought ome mr <\s>
<s> pendennis's ead of air <\s>
<s> it must have been a grand but melancholy sight to see pen in the recesses of his apartment sadly contemplating his ravaged beauty and the artificial means of hiding its ruin <\s>
<s> he appeared at length in the ead of air but warrington laughed so that pen grew sulky and went back for his velvet cap a neat turban which the fondest of mammas had worked for him <\s>
<s> warrington and miss bell got some flowers off the ladies bonnets and made a wreath with which they decorated the wig and brought it out in procession and did homage before it <\s>
<s> in fact they indulged in a hundred sports jularities waggeries and petits jeux innocens so that the second and third floors of number 6 lamb court temple rang with more cheerfulness and laughter than had been known in those precincts for many a long day <\s>
<s> at last after about ten days of this life one evening when the little spy of the court came out to take her usual post of observation at the lamp there was no music from the second floor window there were no lights in the third story chambers the windows of each were open and the occupants were gone <\s>
<s> flanagan the laundress told fanny what had happened <\s>
<s> the ladies and all the party had gone to richmond for change of air <\s>
<s> the antique travelling chariot was brought out again and cushioned with many pillows for pen and his mother and miss laura went in the most affable manner in the omnibus under the guardianship of mr <\s>
<s> he came back and took possession of his old bed that night in the vacant and cheerless chambers and to his old books and his old pipes but not perhaps to his old sleep <\s>
<s> the widow had left a jar full of flowers upon his table prettily arranged and when he entered they filled the solitary room with odour <\s>
<s> they were memorials of the kind gentle souls who had gone away and who had decorated for a little while that lonely cheerless place <\s>
<s> he had had the happiest days of his whole life george felt he knew it now they were just gone he went and took up the flowers and put his face to them and smelt them perhaps kissed them <\s>
<s> as he put them down he rubbed his rough hand across his eyes with a bitter word and laugh <\s>

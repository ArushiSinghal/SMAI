<s> has he had any rest <\s>
<s> go and ask them <\s>
<s> they're inside fanny answered <\s>
<s> fanny nodded her head and didn't speak <\s>
<s> you must go to bed yourself my poor little maid said the doctor <\s>
<s> you will be ill too if you don't <\s>
<s> oh mayn't i come and see him mayn't i come and see him <\s>
<s> i i love him so the little girl said and as she spoke she fell down on her knees and clasped hold of the doctor's hand in such an agony that to see her melted the kind physician's heart and caused a mist to come over his spectacles <\s>
<s> nurse has he taken his draught <\s>
<s> has he had any rest <\s>
<s> of course you must come and see him <\s>
<s> they'll let me sit here won't they sir <\s>
<s> i'll never make no noise <\s>
<s> i only ask to stop here fanny said <\s>
<s> on which the doctor called her a stupid little thing put her down upon the bench where pen's printer's devil used to sit so many hours tapped her pale cheek with his finger and bustled into the farther room <\s>
<s> pendennis was ensconced pale and solemn in a great chair by pen's bedside <\s>
<s> her watch was on the bed table by pen's medicines <\s>
<s> her bonnet and cloaks were laid in the window <\s>
<s> she had her bible in her lap without which she never travelled <\s>
<s> her first movement after seeing her son had been to take fanny's shawl and bonnet which were on his drawers and bring them out and drop them down upon his study table <\s>
<s> morgan said he had asked that question and had been told that mr <\s>
<s> pendennis had had no doctor <\s>
<s> morgan's master was sincerely vexed at hearing of arthur's calamity <\s>
<s> he would have gone to him but what good could it do arthur that he the major should catch a fever <\s>
<s> his own ailments rendered it absolutely impossible that he should attend to anybody but himself <\s>
<s> but the young man must have advice the best advice and morgan was straightway despatched with a note from major pendennis to his friend doctor goodenough who by good luck happened to be in london and at home and who quitted his dinner instantly and whose carriage was in half an hour in upper temple lane near pen's chambers <\s>
<s> the major had asked the kind hearted physician to bring him news of his nephew at the club where he himself was dining and in the course of the night the doctor made his appearance <\s>
<s> the affair was very serious the patient was in a high fever he had had pen bled instantly and would see him the first thing in the morning <\s>
<s> the major went disconsolate to bed with this unfortunate news <\s>
<s> when goodenough came to see him according to his promise the next day the doctor had to listen for a quarter of an hour to an account of the major's own maladies before the latter had leisure to hear about arthur <\s>
<s> he had had a very bad night his his nurse said at one hour he had been delirious <\s>
<s> it might end badly his mother had better be sent for immediately <\s>
<s> the major wrote the letter to mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis with the greatest alacrity and at the same time with the most polite precautions <\s>
<s> as for going himself to the lad in his state it was impossible <\s>
<s> could i be of any use to him my dear doctor <\s>
<s> the doctor with a peculiar laugh said no he didn't think the major could be of any use that his own precious health required the most delicate treatment and that he had best go into the country and stay that he himself would take care to see the patient twice a day and do all in his power for him <\s>
<s> the major declared upon his honour that if he could be of any use he would rush to pen's chambers <\s>
<s> as it was morgan should go and see that everything was right <\s>
<s> the doctor must write to him by every post to stillbrook it was but forty miles distant from london and if anything happened he would come up at any sacrifice <\s>
<s> major pendennis transacted his benevolence by deputy and by post <\s>
<s> what else could he do as he said <\s>
<s> gad you know in these cases it's best not disturbing a fellow <\s>
<s> if a poor fellow goes to the bad why gad you know he's disposed of <\s>
<s> but in order to get well and in this my dear doctor i'm sure that you will agree with me the best way is to keep him quiet perfectly quiet <\s>
<s> thus it was the old gentleman tried to satisfy his conscience and he went his way that day to stillbrook by railway for railways have sprung up in the course of this narrative though they have not quite penetrated into pen's country yet and made his appearance in his usual trim order and curly wig at the dinner table of the marquis of steyne <\s>
<s> but we must do the major the justice to say that he was very unhappy and gloomy in demeanour <\s>
<s> wagg and wenham rallied him about his low spirits asked whether he was crossed in love <\s>
<s> and otherwise diverted themselves at his expense <\s>
<s> he lost his money at whist after dinner and actually trumped his partner's highest spade <\s>
<s> and the thoughts of the suffering boy of whom he was proud and whom he loved after his manner kept the old fellow awake half through the night and made him feverish and uneasy <\s>
<s> on the morrow he received a note in a handwriting which he did not know it was that of mr <\s>
<s> bows indeed saying that mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis had had a tolerable night and that as dr <\s>
<s> goodenough had stated that the major desired to be informed of his nephew's health he r <\s>
<s> b had sent him the news per rail <\s>
<s> the next day he was going out shooting about noon with some of the gentlemen staying at lord steyne's house and the company waiting for the carriages were assembled on the terrace in front of the house when a fly drove up from the neighbouring station and a grey headed rather shabby old gentleman jumped out and asked for major pendennis <\s>
<s> he took the major aside and spoke to him most of the gentlemen round about saw that something serious had happened from the alarmed look of the major's face <\s>
<s> wagg said it's a bailiff come down to nab the major but nobody laughed at the pleasantry <\s>
<s> what's the matter pendennis <\s>
<s> cried lord steyne with his strident voice anything wrong <\s>
<s> it's it's my boy that's dead said the major and burst into a sob the old man was quite overcome <\s>
<s> not dead my lord but very ill when i left london mr <\s>
<s> bows said in a low voice <\s>
<s> a britzka came up at this moment as the three men were speaking <\s>
<s> the peer looked at his watch <\s>
<s> you've twenty minutes to catch the mail train <\s>
<s> jump in pendennis and drive like h sir do you hear <\s>
<s> the carriage drove off swiftly with pendennis and his companions and let us trust that the oath will be pardoned to the marquis of steyne <\s>
<s> the major drove rapidly from the station to the temple and found a travelling carriage already before him and blocking up the narrow temple lane <\s>
<s> two ladies got out of it and were asking their way of the porters the major looked by chance at the panel of the carriage and saw the worn out crest of the eagle looking at the sun and the motto nec tenui penna painted beneath <\s>
<s> it was his brother's old carriage built many many years ago <\s>
<s> it was helen and laura that were asking their way to pen's room <\s>
<s> he ran up to them hastily clasped his sister's arm and kissed her hand and the three entered into lamb court and mounted the long gloomy stair <\s>
<s> they knocked very gently at the door on which arthur's name was written and it was opened by fanny bolton <\s>
<s> a critical chapter as fanny saw the two ladies and the anxious countenance of the eider who regarded her with a look of inscrutable alarm and terror the poor girl at once knew that pen's mother was before her there was a resemblance between the widow's haggard eyes and arthur's as he tossed in his bed in fever <\s>
<s> fanny looked wistfully at mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis and at laura afterwards there was no more expression in the latter's face than if it had been a mass of stone <\s>
<s> hard heartedness and gloom dwelt on the figures of both the new comers neither showed any the faintest gleam of mercy or sympathy for fanny <\s>
<s> she looked desperately from them to the major behind them <\s>
<s> old pendennis dropped his eyelids looking up ever so stealthily from under them at arthur's poor little nurse <\s>
<s> i i wrote to you yesterday if you please ma'am fanny said trembling in every limb as she spoke and as pale as laura whose sad menacing face looked over mrs <\s>
<s> i suppose i may now relieve you from nursing my son <\s>
<s> i am his mother you understand <\s>
<s> i this is the way to his oh wait a minute cried out fanny <\s>
<s> i must prepare you for his the widow whose face had been hopelessly cruel and ruthless here started back with a gasp and a little cry which she speedily stifled <\s>
<s> he's been so since yesterday fanny said trembling very much and with chattering teeth <\s>
<s> a horrid shriek of laughter came out of pen's room whereof the door was open and after several shouts the poor wretch began to sing a college drinking song and then to hurray and to shout as if he was in the midst of a wine party and to thump with his fist against the wainscot <\s>
<s> he was quite delirious <\s>
<s> he does not know me ma'am fanny said <\s>
<s> perhaps he will know his mother let me pass if you please and go in to him <\s>
<s> and the widow hastily pushed by little fanny and through the dark passage which led into pen's sitting room <\s>
<s> laura sailed by fanny too without a word and major pendennis followed them <\s>
<s> fanny sat down on a bench in the passage and cried and prayed as well as she could <\s>
<s> she would have died for him and they hated her <\s>
<s> they had not a word of thanks or kindness for her the fine ladies <\s>
<s> she sate there in the passage she did not know how long <\s>
<s> they never came out to speak to her <\s>
<s> she sate there until doctor goodenough came to pay his second visit that day he found the poor little thing at the door <\s>

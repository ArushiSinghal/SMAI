<s> bonner as told me and swear as he never more would touch a card or a dice or put his name to a bit of paper and my lady was a goin to give him the notes down to pay his liabilities after the race only your governor said which he wrote it on a piece of paper and passed it across the table to the lawyer and my lady that some one else had better book up for him for he'd have kep some of the money <\s>
<s> he's a sly old cove your gov'nor <\s>
<s> the expression of old cove thus flippantly applied by the younger gentleman to himself and his master displeased mr <\s>
<s> on the first occasion when mr <\s>
<s> lightfoot used the obnoxious expression his comrade's anger was only indicated by a silent frown but on the second offence morgan who was smoking his cigar elegantly and holding it on the tip of his penknife withdrew the cigar from his lips and took his young friend to task <\s>
<s> don't call major pendennis an old cove if you'll ave the goodness lightfoot and don't call me an old cove nether <\s>

<s> arthur's property remarked lightfoot <\s>
<s> what's about the figure of it should you say sir <\s>
<s> under fifteen hundred sir answered morgan at which the other who knew the extent of poor arthur's acres thrust his tongue in his cheek but remained wisely silent <\s>
<s> is his man any good mr <\s>
<s> pidgeon ain't used to society as yet but he's young and has good talents and has read a good deal and i dessay he will do very well replied morgan <\s>
<s> he wouldn't quite do for this kind of thing lightfoot for he ain't seen the world yet <\s>
<s> when the pint of sherry for which mr <\s>
<s> lightfoot called upon mr <\s>
<s> morgan's announcement that he eclined to drink spirits had been discussed by the two gentlemen who held the wine up to the light and smacked their lips and winked their eyes at it and rallied the landlord as to the vintage in the most approved manner of connoisseurs morgan's ruffled equanimity was quite restored and he was prepared to treat his young friend with perfect good humour <\s>
<s> what d'you think about miss amory lightfoot tell us in confidence now do you think we should do well you understand if we make miss a <\s>
<s> she and her ma's always quarrellin said mr <\s>
<s> bonner is more than a match for the old lady and treats sir francis like that like this year spill which i fling into the grate <\s>
<s> but she daren't say a word to miss amory <\s>
<s> no more dare none of us <\s>
<s> when a visitor comes in she smiles and languishes you'd think that butter wouldn't melt in her mouth and the minute he is gone very likely she flares up like a little demon and says things fit to send you wild <\s>
<s> arthur comes it's do let's sing that there delightful song <\s>
<s> or come and write me them pooty verses in this halbum <\s>

<s> oh she's a devil that little blanche and that's my candig apinium mr <\s>
<s> apinion not apinium lightfoot my good fellow mr <\s>
<s> morgan said with parental kindness and then asked of his own bosom with a sigh why the deuce does my governor want master arthur to marry such a girl as this <\s>
<s> and the tete a tete of the two gentlemen was broken up by the entry of other gentlemen members of the club when fashionable town talk politics cribbage and other amusements ensued and the conversation became general <\s>
<s> the gentleman's club was held in the parlour of the wheel of fortune public house in a snug little by lane leading out of one of the great streets of mayfair and frequented by some of the most select gentlemen about town <\s>
<s> their masters affairs debts intrigues adventures their ladies good and bad qualities and quarrels with their husbands all the family secrets were here discussed with perfect freedom and confidence and here when about to enter into a new situation a gentleman was enabled to get every requisite information regarding the family of which he proposed to become a member <\s>
<s> liveries it may be imagined were excluded from this select precinct and the powdered heads of the largest metropolitan footmen might bow down in vain entreating admission into the gentleman's club <\s>
<s> these outcast giants in plush took their beer in an outer apartment of the wheel of fortune and could no more get an entry into the clubroom than a pall mall tradesman or a lincoln's inn attorney could get admission into bays's or spratt's <\s>
<s> and it is because the conversation which we have permitted to overhear here in some measure explains the characters and bearings of our story that we have ventured to introduce the reader into a society so exclusive <\s>
<s> the way of the world a short time after the piece of good fortune which befell colonel altamont at epsom that gentleman put into execution his projected foreign tour and the chronicler of the polite world who goes down to london bridge for the purpose of taking leave of the people of fashion who quit this country announced that among the company on board the soho to antwerp last saturday were sir robert lady and the misses hodge mr <\s>
<s> serjeant kewsy and mrs <\s>
<s> and miss kewsy colonel altamont major coddy etc <\s>
<s> the colonel travelled in state and as became a gentleman he appeared in a rich travelling costume he drank brandy and water freely during the passage and was not sick as some of the other passengers were and he was attended by his body servant the faithful irish legionary who had been for some time in waiting upon himself and captain strong in their chambers of shepherd's inn <\s>
<s> the chevalier partook of a copious dinner at blackwall with his departing friend the colonel and one or two others who drank many healths to altamont at that liberal gentleman's expense <\s>
<s> strong old boy the chevalier's worthy chum said if you want a little money now's your time <\s>
<s> you're a good feller and have been a good feller to me and a twenty pound note more or less will make no odds to me but strong said no he didn't want any money he was flush quite flush that is not flush enough to pay you back your last loan altamont but quite able to carry on for some time to come and so with a not uncordial greeting between them the two parted <\s>
<s> had the possession of money really made altamont more honest and amiable than he had hitherto been or only caused him to seem more amiable in strong's eyes <\s>
<s> perhaps he really was better and money improved him <\s>
<s> perhaps it was the beauty of wealth strong saw and respected <\s>
<s> but he argued within himself this poor devil this unlucky outcast of a returned convict is ten times as good a fellow as my friend sir francis clavering bart <\s>
<s> he has pluck and honesty in his way <\s>
<s> he will stick to a friend and face an enemy <\s>
<s> the other never had courage to do either <\s>
<s> and what is it that has put the poor devil under a cloud <\s>
<s> he was only a little wild and signed his father in law's name <\s>

<s> mary's to the present day rose up in purple splendour <\s>

<s> thine this universal frame greatly to mrs <\s>
<s> such walks and conversation generally ended in a profusion of filial and maternal embraces for to love and to pray were the main occupations of this dear woman's life and i have often heard pendennis say in his wild way that he felt that he was sure of going to heaven for his mother never could be happy there without him <\s>
<s> as for john pendennis as the father of the family and that sort of thing everybody had the greatest respect for him and his orders were obeyed like those of the medes and persians <\s>
<s> his hat was as well brushed perhaps as that of any man in this empire <\s>
<s> his meals were served at the same minute every day and woe to those who came late as little pen a disorderly little rascal sometimes did <\s>
<s> prayers were recited his letters were read his business dispatched his stables and garden inspected his hen houses and kennel his barn and pigstye visited always at regular hours <\s>
<s> after dinner he always had a nap with the globe newspaper on his knee and his yellow bandanna handkerchief on his face major pendennis sent the yellow handkerchiefs from india and his brother had helped in the purchase of his majority so that they were good friends now <\s>
<s> and so as his dinner took place at six o'clock to a minute and the sunset business alluded to may be supposed to have occurred at about half past seven it is probable that he did not much care for the view in front of his lawn windows or take any share in the poetry and caresses which were taking place there <\s>
<s> they seldom occurred in his presence <\s>
<s> however frisky they were before mother and child were hushed and quiet when mr <\s>
<s> pendennis walked into the drawing room his newspaper under his arm <\s>
<s> and here while little pen buried in a great chair read all the books of which he could lay hold the squire perused his own articles in the gardener's gazette or took a solemn hand at picquet with mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis or an occasional friend from the village <\s>
<s> pendennis usually took care that at least one of his grand dinners should take place when his brother the major who on the return of his regiment from india and new south wales had sold out and gone upon half pay came to pay his biennial visit to fairoaks <\s>
<s> my brother major pendennis was a constant theme of the retired doctor's conversation <\s>
<s> all the family delighted in my brother the major <\s>
<s> he was the link which bound them to the great world of london and the fashion <\s>
<s> he always brought down the last news of the nobility and was in the constant habit of dining with lords and great folks <\s>
<s> he spoke of such with soldierlike respect and decorum <\s>
<s> he would say my lord bareacres has been good enough to invite me to bareacres for the pheasant shooting or my lord steyne is so kind as to wish for my presence at stillbrook for the easter holidays and you may be sure the whereabouts of my brother the major was carefully made known by worthy mr <\s>
<s> pendennis to his friends at the clavering reading room at justice meetings or at the county town <\s>
<s> their carriages would come from ten miles round to call upon major pendennis in his visits to fairoaks the fame of his fashion as a man about town was established throughout the county <\s>
<s> there was a talk of his marrying miss hunkle of lilybank old hunkle the attorney's daughter with at least fifteen hundred a year to her fortune but my brother the major refused this negotiation advantageous as it might seem to most persons <\s>
<s> as a bachelor he said nobody cares how poor i am <\s>
<s> i have the happiness to live with people who are so highly placed in the world that a few hundreds or thousands a year more or less can make no difference in the estimation in which they are pleased to hold me <\s>
<s> miss hunkle though a most respectable lady is not in possession of either the birth or the manners which would entitle her to be received into the sphere in which i have the honour to move <\s>
<s> i shall live and die an old bachelor john and your worthy friend miss hunkle i have no doubt will find some more worthy object of her affection than a worn out old soldier on half pay <\s>
<s> time showed the correctness of the surmise of the old man of the world miss hunkle married a young french nobleman and is now at this moment living at lilybank under the title of baroness de carambole having been separated from her wild young scapegrace of a baron very shortly after their union <\s>
<s> the major was a great favourite with almost all the little establishment of fairoaks <\s>
<s> he was as good natured as he was well bred and had a sincere liking and regard for his sister in law whom he pronounced and with perfect truth to be as fine a lady as any in england and an honour to the family <\s>
<s> pendennis's tranquil beauty her natural sweetness and kindness and that simplicity and dignity which a perfect purity and innocence are sure to bestow upon a handsome woman rendered her quite worthy of her brother's praises <\s>
<s> i think it is not national prejudice which makes me believe that a high bred english lady is the most complete of all heaven's subjects in this world <\s>
<s> in whom else do you see so much grace and so much virtue so much faith and so much tenderness with such a perfect refinement and chastity <\s>
<s> and by high bred ladies i don't mean duchesses and countesses <\s>
<s> be they ever so high in station they can be but ladies and no more <\s>
<s> but almost every man who lives in the world has the happiness let us hope of counting a few such persons amongst his circle of acquaintance women in whose angelical natures there is something awful as well as beautiful to contemplate at whose feet the wildest and fiercest of us must fall down and humble ourselves in admiration of that adorable purity which never seems to do or to think wrong <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis had the good fortune to have a mother endowed with these happy qualities <\s>
<s> during his childhood and youth the boy thought of her as little less than an angel as a supernatural being all wisdom love and beauty <\s>
<s> when her husband drove her into the county town or to the assize balls or concerts there he would step into the assembly with his wife on his arm and look the great folks in the face as much as to say look at that my lord can any of you show me a woman like that <\s>
<s> she enraged some country ladies with three times her money by a sort of desperate perfection which they found in her <\s>
<s> miss pybus said she was cold and haughty miss pierce that she was too proud for her station mrs <\s>
<s> wapshot as a doctor of divinity's lady would have the pas of her who was only the wife of a medical practitioner <\s>
<s> in the meanwhile this lady moved through the world quite regardless of all the comments that were made in her praise or disfavour <\s>
<s> she did not seem to know that she was admired or hated for being so perfect but carried on calmly through life saying her prayers loving her family helping her neighbours and doing her duty <\s>
<s> that even a woman should be faultless however is an arrangement not permitted by nature which assigns to us mental defects as it awards to us headaches illnesses or death without which the scheme of the world could not be carried on nay some of the best qualities of mankind could not be brought into exercise <\s>
<s> as pain produces or elicits fortitude and endurance difficulty perseverance poverty industry and ingenuity danger courage and what not so the very virtues on the other hand will generate some vices and in fine mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis had that vice which miss pybus and miss pierce discovered in her namely that of pride which did not vest itself so much in her own person as in that of her family <\s>
<s> she spoke about mr <\s>
<s> pendennis a worthy little gentleman enough but there are others as good as he with an awful reverence as if he had been the pope of rome on his throne and she a cardinal kneeling at his feet and giving him incense <\s>
<s> the major she held to be a sort of bayard among majors and as for her son arthur she worshipped that youth with an ardour which the young scapegrace accepted almost as coolly as the statue of the saint in saint peter's receives the rapturous osculations which the faithful deliver on his toe <\s>
<s> this unfortunate superstition and idol worship of this good woman was the cause of a great deal of the misfortune which befell the young gentleman who is the hero of this history and deserves therefore to be mentioned at the outset of his story <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis's schoolfellows at the greyfriars school state that as a boy he was in no ways remarkable either as a dunce or as a scholar <\s>
<s> he did in fact just as much as was required of him and no more <\s>
<s> if he was distinguished for anything it was for verse writing but was his enthusiasm ever so great it stopped when he had composed the number of lines demanded by the regulations unlike young swettenham for instance who with no more of poetry in his composition than mr <\s>
<s> wakley yet would bring up a hundred dreary hexameters to the master after a half holiday or young fluxmore who not only did his own verses but all the fifth form's besides <\s>
<s> he never read to improve himself out of school hours but on the contrary devoured all the novels plays and poetry on which he could lay his hands <\s>
<s> he never was flogged but it was a wonder how he escaped the whipping post <\s>
<s> when he had money he spent it royally in tarts for himself and his friends he has been known to disburse nine and sixpence out of ten shillings awarded to him in a single day <\s>
<s> when he had no funds he went on tick <\s>
<s> when he could get no credit he went without and was almost as happy <\s>
<s> he has been known to take a thrashing for a crony without saying a word but a blow ever so slight from a friend would make him roar <\s>
<s> to fighting he was averse from his earliest youth as indeed to physic the greek grammar or any other exertion and would engage in none of them except at the last extremity <\s>
<s> he seldom if ever told lies and never bullied little boys <\s>
<s> those masters or seniors who were kind to him he loved with boyish ardour <\s>
<s> and though the doctor when he did not know his horace or could not construe his greek play said that that boy pendennis was a disgrace to the school a candidate for ruin in this world and perdition in the next a profligate who would most likely bring his venerable father to ruin and his mother to a dishonoured grave and the like yet as the doctor made use of these compliments to most of the boys in the place which has not turned out an unusual number of felons and pickpockets little pen at first uneasy and terrified by these charges became gradually accustomed to hear them and he has not in fact either murdered his parents or committed any act worthy of transportation or hanging up to the present day <\s>
<s> there were many of the upper boys among the cistercians with whom pendennis was educated who assumed all the privileges of men long before they quitted that seminary <\s>
<s> many of them for example smoked cigars and some had already begun the practice of inebriation <\s>
<s> one had fought a duel with an ensign in a marching in consequence of a row at the theatre another actually kept a buggy and horse at a livery stable in covent garden and might be seen driving any sunday in hyde park with a groom with squared arms and armorial buttons by his side <\s>
<s> many of the seniors were in love and showed each other in confidence poems addressed to or letters and locks of hair received from young ladies but pen a modest and timid youth rather envied these than imitated them as yet <\s>
<s> he had not got beyond the theory as yet the practice of life was all to come <\s>
<s> and by the way ye tender mothers and sober fathers of christian families a prodigious thing that theory of life is as orally learned at a great public school <\s>

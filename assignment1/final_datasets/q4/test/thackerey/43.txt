<s> it will be the talk of the town in a day or two and there is no need why i should keep the secret any longer said lady rockminster who had written and received a dozen letters on the subject <\s>
<s> i had a letter yesterday from my daughter who was staying at drummington until all the world was obliged to go away on account of the frightful catastrophe which happened there <\s>
<s> foker came home from nice and after the funeral lady ann went down on her knees to her father said that she never could marry her cousin that she had contracted another attachment and that she must die rather than fulfil her contract <\s>

<s> rumours from naples and paris rumours such as are borne to club smoking rooms had announced that the young man had found distractions or precluded from his virtuous attachment the poor fellow had flung himself back upon his old companions and amusements not the only man or woman whom society forces into evil or debars from good not the only victim of the world's selfish and wicked laws <\s>
<s> as a good thing when it is to be done cannot be done too quickly laura was anxious that pen's marriage intentions should be put into execution as speedily as possible and pressed on his arrangements with rather a feverish anxiety <\s>

<s> it will be the talk of the town in a day or two and there is no need why i should keep the secret any longer said lady rockminster who had written and received a dozen letters on the subject <\s>
<s> i had a letter yesterday from my daughter who was staying at drummington until all the world was obliged to go away on account of the frightful catastrophe which happened there <\s>
<s> foker came home from nice and after the funeral lady ann went down on her knees to her father said that she never could marry her cousin that she had contracted another attachment and that she must die rather than fulfil her contract <\s>

<s> the bracelets and presents were for some of harry's old friends of the opera or the french theatre <\s>
<s> rumours from naples and paris rumours such as are borne to club smoking rooms had announced that the young man had found distractions or precluded from his virtuous attachment the poor fellow had flung himself back upon his old companions and amusements not the only man or woman whom society forces into evil or debars from good not the only victim of the world's selfish and wicked laws <\s>
<s> as a good thing when it is to be done cannot be done too quickly laura was anxious that pen's marriage intentions should be put into execution as speedily as possible and pressed on his arrangements with rather a feverish anxiety <\s>
<s> why could she not wait <\s>

<s> the dowager lady must nurse herself in her rheumatism she must read herself to sleep if she would not hear her maid whose voice croaked and who made sad work of the sentimental passages in the novels laura must go and be with her new sister <\s>

<s> you must love george as you love what is generous and upright and noble and as for laura she must be our sister blanche our saint our good angel <\s>
<s> with two such friends at home what need we care for the world without or who is member for clavering or who is asked or not asked to the great balls of the season <\s>
<s> to this frank communication came back the letter from blanche to laura and one to pen himself which perhaps his own letter justified <\s>
<s> you are spoiled by the world blanche wrote you do not love your poor blanche as she would be loved or you would not offer thus lightly to take her or to leave her no arthur you love me not a man of the world you have given me your plighted troth and are ready to redeem it but that entire affection that love whole and abiding where where is that vision of my youth <\s>
<s> i am but a pastime of your life and i would be its all but a fleeting thought and i would be your whole soul <\s>

<s> he has been engaged for many years past to his cousin lady lady ann is a foolish little chit lady rockminster said with much dignity and i have no patience with her <\s>
<s> she has outraged every feeling of society <\s>
<s> she has broken her father's heart and thrown away fifteen thousand a year <\s>
<s> it will be the talk of the town in a day or two and there is no need why i should keep the secret any longer said lady rockminster who had written and received a dozen letters on the subject <\s>
<s> i had a letter yesterday from my daughter who was staying at drummington until all the world was obliged to go away on account of the frightful catastrophe which happened there <\s>
<s> foker came home from nice and after the funeral lady ann went down on her knees to her father said that she never could marry her cousin that she had contracted another attachment and that she must die rather than fulfil her contract <\s>
<s> poor lord rosherville who is dreadfully embarrassed showed his daughter what the state of his affairs was and that it was necessary that the arrangements should take place and in fine we all supposed that she had listened to reason and intended to comply with the desires of her family <\s>
<s> but what has happened last thursday she went out after breakfast with her maid and was married in the very church in drummington park to mr <\s>
<s> hobson her father's own chaplain and her brother's tutor a red haired widower with two children <\s>
<s> poor dear rosherville is in a dreadful way he wishes henry foker should marry alice or barbara but alice is marked with the small pox and barbara is ten years older than he is <\s>

<s> why did harry seem anxious to avoid him <\s>
<s> could he be still faithful to the attachment which had agitated him so much and sent him abroad eighteen months back <\s>
<s> the bracelets and presents were for some of harry's old friends of the opera or the french theatre <\s>
<s> rumours from naples and paris rumours such as are borne to club smoking rooms had announced that the young man had found distractions or precluded from his virtuous attachment the poor fellow had flung himself back upon his old companions and amusements not the only man or woman whom society forces into evil or debars from good not the only victim of the world's selfish and wicked laws <\s>
<s> as a good thing when it is to be done cannot be done too quickly laura was anxious that pen's marriage intentions should be put into execution as speedily as possible and pressed on his arrangements with rather a feverish anxiety <\s>
<s> why could she not wait <\s>
<s> pen could afford to do so with perfect equanimity but laura would hear of no delay <\s>
<s> she wrote to pen she implored pen she used every means to urge expedition <\s>
<s> it seemed as if she could have no rest until arthur's happiness was complete <\s>
<s> she offered herself to dearest blanche to come and stay at tunbridge with her when lady rockminster should go on her intended visit to the reigning house of rockminster and although the old dowager scolded and ordered and commanded laura was deaf and disobedient she must go to tunbridge she would go to tunbridge she who ordinarily had no will of her own and complied smilingly with anybody's whim and caprices showed the most selfish and obstinate determination in this instance <\s>
<s> the dowager lady must nurse herself in her rheumatism she must read herself to sleep if she would not hear her maid whose voice croaked and who made sad work of the sentimental passages in the novels laura must go and be with her new sister <\s>
<s> in another week she proposed with many loves and regards to dear lady clavering to pass some time with dearest blanche <\s>
<s> dearest blanche wrote instantly in reply to dearest laura's no <\s>
<s> 1 to say with what extreme delight she should welcome her sister how charming it would be to practise their old duets together to wander o'er the grassy sward and amidst the yellowing woods of penshurst and southborough <\s>

<s> 2 expressed her delight at dearest blanche's affectionate reply <\s>

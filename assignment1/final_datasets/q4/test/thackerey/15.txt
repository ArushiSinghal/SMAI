<s> one seemed to have a bird's nest in her head another had six pounds of grapes in her hair besides her false pearls <\s>
<s> it's a coiffure of almonds and raisins said pen and might be served up for dessert <\s>
<s> in a word he was exceedingly satirical and amusing <\s>
<s> during the quadrille he carried on this kind of conversation with unflinching bitterness and vivacity and kept blanche continually laughing both at his wickedness and jokes which were good and also because laura was again their vis a vis and could see and hear how merry and confidential they were <\s>
<s> arthur is charming to night she whispered to laura across cornet perch's shell jacket as pen was performing cavalier seul before them drawling through that figure with a thumb in the pocket of each waistcoat <\s>
<s> arthur answered blanche in french <\s>
<s> oh it's such a pretty name <\s>
<s> and now the young ladies went over to pen's side and cornet perch performed a pas seul in his turn <\s>
<s> he had no waistcoat pocket to put his hands into and they looked large and swollen as they hung before him depending from the tight arms in the jacket <\s>
<s> during the interval between the quadrille and the succeeding waltz pen did not take any notice of laura except to ask her whether her partner cornet perch was an amusing youth and whether she liked him so well as her other partner mr <\s>
<s> having planted which two daggers in laura's gentle bosom mr <\s>
<s> pendennis proceeded to rattle on with blanche amory and to make jokes good or bad but which were always loud <\s>
<s> laura was at a loss to account for her cousin's sulky behaviour and ignorant in what she had offended him however she was not angry in her turn at pen's splenetic mood for she was the most good natured and forgiving of women and besides an exhibition of jealousy on a man's part is not always disagreeable to a lady <\s>
<s> as pen would not dance with her she was glad to take up with the active chevalier strong who was a still better performer than pen and being very fond of dancing as every brisk and innocent young girl should be when the waltz music began she set off and chose to enjoy herself with all her heart <\s>
<s> captain broadfoot on this occasion occupied the floor in conjunction with a lady of proportions scarcely inferior to his own miss roundle a large young woman in a strawberry ice coloured crape dress the daughter of the lady with the grapes in her head whose bunches pen had admired <\s>
<s> and now taking his time and with his fair partner blanche hanging lovingly on the arm which encircled her mr <\s>
<s> arthur pendennis set out upon his waltzing career and felt as he whirled round to the music that he and blanche were performing very brilliantly indeed <\s>
<s> very likely he looked to see if miss bell thought so too but she did not or would not see him and was always engaged with her partner captain strong <\s>
<s> but pen's triumph was not destined to last long and it was doomed that poor blanche was to have yet another discomfiture on that unfortunate night <\s>
<s> while she and pen were whirling round as light and brisk as a couple of opera dancers honest captain broadfoot and the lady round whose large waist he was clinging were twisting round very leisurely according to their natures and indeed were in everybody's way <\s>
<s> but they were more in pendennis's way than in anybody's else for he and blanche whilst executing their rapid gyrations came bolt up against the heavy dragoon and his lady and with such force that the centre of gravity was lost by all four of the circumvolving bodies captain broadfoot and miss roundle were fairly upset as was pen himself who was less lucky than his partner miss amory who was only thrown upon a bench against a wall <\s>
<s> but pendennis came fairly down upon the floor sprawling in the general ruin with broadfoot and miss roundle <\s>
<s> the captain though heavy was good natured and was the first to burst out into a loud laugh at his own misfortune which nobody therefore heeded <\s>
<s> but miss amory was savage at her mishap miss roundle placed on her seant and looking pitifully round presented an object which very few people could see without laughing and pen was furious when he heard the people giggling about him <\s>
<s> he was one of those sarcastic young fellows that did not bear a laugh at his own expense and of all things in the world feared ridicule most <\s>
<s> as he got up laura and strong were laughing at him everybody was laughing pynsent and his partner were laughing and pen boiled with wrath against the pair and could have stabbed them both on the spot <\s>
<s> he turned away in a fury from them and began blundering out apologies to miss amory <\s>
<s> it was the other couple's fault the woman in pink had done it pen hoped miss amory was not hurt would she not have the courage to take another turn <\s>
<s> miss amory in a pet said she was very much hurt indeed and she would not take another turn and she accepted with great thanks a glass of water which a cavalier who wore a blue ribbon and a three pointed star rushed to fetch for her when he had seen the deplorable accident <\s>
<s> she drank the water smiled upon the bringer gracefully and turning her white shoulder at mr <\s>
<s> pen in the most marked and haughty manner besought the gentleman with the star to conduct her to her mamma and she held out her hand in order to take his arm <\s>
<s> the man with the star trembled with delight at this mark of her favour he bowed over her hand pressed it to his coat fervidly and looked round him with triumph <\s>
<s> it was no other than the happy mirobolant whom blanche had selected as an escort <\s>
<s> but the truth is that the young lady had never fairly looked in the artist's face since he had been employed in her mother's family and had no idea but it was a foreign nobleman on whose arm she was leaning <\s>
<s> as she went off pen forgot his humiliation in his surprise and cried out by jove it's the cook <\s>
<s> the instant he had uttered the words he was sorry for having spoken them for it was blanche who had herself invited mirobolant to escort her nor could the artist do otherwise than comply with a lady's command <\s>
<s> blanche in her flutter did not hear what arthur said but mirobolant heard him and cast a furious glance at him over his shoulder which rather amused mr <\s>
<s> he was in a mischievous and sulky humour wanting perhaps to pick a quarrel with somebody but the idea of having insulted a cook or that such an individual should have any feeling of honour at all did not much enter into the mind of this lofty young aristocrat the apothecary's son <\s>
<s> it had never entered that poor artist's head that he as a man was not equal to any other mortal or that there was anything in his position so degrading as to prevent him from giving his arm to a lady who asked for it <\s>
<s> he had seen in the fetes in his own country fine ladies not certainly demoiselles but the demoiselle anglaise he knew was a great deal more free than the spinster in france join in the dance with blaise or pierre and he would have taken blanche up to lady clavering and possibly have asked her to dance too but he heard pen's exclamation which struck him as if it had shot him and cruelly humiliated and angered him <\s>
<s> she did not know what caused him to start and to grind a gascon oath between his teeth <\s>
<s> but strong who was acquainted with the poor fellow's state of mind having had the interesting information from our friend madame fribsby was luckily in the way when wanted and saying something rapidly in spanish which the other understood the chevalier begged miss amory to come and take an ice before she went back to lady clavering <\s>
<s> upon which the unhappy mirobolant relinquished the arm which he had held for a minute and with a most profound and piteous bow fell back <\s>
<s> don't you know who it is <\s>
<s> strong asked of miss amory as he led her away <\s>
<s> it is the chef mirobolant <\s>
<s> how should i know <\s>

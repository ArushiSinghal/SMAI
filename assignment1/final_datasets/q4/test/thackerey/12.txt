<s> pen took walks there unattended by her and about which he did not tell her <\s>
<s> he took to fishing the brawl which runs through the park and passes not very far from the garden wall <\s>
<s> and by the oddest coincidence miss amory would walk out having been to look at her flowers and would be quite surprised to see mr <\s>
<s> i wonder what trout pen caught while the young lady was looking on <\s>
<s> or whether miss blanche was the pretty little fish which played round his fly and which mr <\s>
<s> pen was endeavouring to hook <\s>
<s> it must be owned he became very fond of that healthful and invigorating pursuit of angling and was whipping the brawl continually with his fly <\s>
<s> as for miss blanche she had a kind heart and having as she owned herself suffered a good deal in the course of her brief life and experience why she could compassionate other susceptible beings like pen who had suffered too <\s>
<s> her love for laura and that dear mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis redoubled if they were not at the park she was not easy unless she herself was at fairoaks <\s>
<s> she played with laura she read french and german with laura and mr <\s>
<s> pen read french and german along with them <\s>
<s> he turned sentimental ballads of schiller and goethe into english verse for the ladies and blanche unlocked mes larmes for him and imparted to him some of the plaintive outpourings of her own tender muse <\s>
<s> it appeared from these poems that this young creature had indeed suffered prodigiously <\s>
<s> she was familiar with the idea of suicide <\s>
<s> death she repeatedly longed for <\s>
<s> a faded rose inspired her with such grief that you would have thought she must die in pain of it <\s>
<s> it was a wonder how a young creature who had had a snug home or been at a comfortable boarding school and had no outward grief or hardship to complain of should have suffered so much should have found the means of getting at such an ocean of despair and passion as a runaway boy who will get to sea and having embarked on it should survive it <\s>
<s> what a talent she must have had for weeping to be able to pour out so many of mes larmes <\s>
<s> they were not particularly briny miss blanche's tears that is the truth but pen who read her verses thought them very well for a lady and wrote some verses himself for her <\s>
<s> his were very violent and passionate very hot sweet and strong and he not only wrote verses but o the villain <\s>
<s> he altered and adapted former poems in his possession and which had been composed for a certain emily fotheringay for the use and to the christian name of miss blanche amory <\s>
<s> a little innocent every house has its skeleton in it somewhere and it may be a comfort to some unhappy folks to think that the luckier and most wealthy of their neighbours have their miseries and causes of disquiet <\s>
<s> our little innocent muse of blanche who sang so nicely and talked so sweetly you would have thought she must have made sunshine where ever she went was the skeleton or the misery or the bore or the nemesis of clavering house and of most of the inhabitants thereof <\s>
<s> as one little stone in your own shoe or your horse's suffices to put either to torture and to make your journey miserable so in life a little obstacle is sufficient to obstruct your entire progress and subject you to endless annoyance and disquiet <\s>
<s> who would have guessed that such a smiling little fairy as blanche amory could be the cause of discord in any family <\s>
<s> i say strong one day the baronet said as the pair were conversing after dinner over the billiard table and that great unbosomer of secrets a cigar i say strong i wish to the doose your wife was dead <\s>
<s> that's a cannon by jove <\s>
<s> but she won't she'll live for ever you see if she don't <\s>
<s> why do you wish her off the hooks frank my boy <\s>
<s> because then you might marry missy <\s>
<s> she'll have ten thousand and that's a good bit of money for such a poor old devil as you drawled out the other gentleman <\s>
<s> and gad strong i hate her worse and worse every day <\s>
<s> i can't stand her strong by gad i can't <\s>

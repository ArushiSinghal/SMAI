<s> i would not have been what i am now had i practised what i preach <\s>
<s> and what did you practise george <\s>
<s> i knew there was something <\s>
<s> tell us about it warrington <\s>
<s> i can't stand old portman's sermons and pompous after dinner conversation <\s>
<s> i know all old glanders's stories about the peninsular war <\s>
<s> the claverings are the only christian people in the neighbourhood and they are not to be at home before christmas my uncle says besides warrington i want to get out of the country <\s>
<s> whilst you were away confound it i had a temptation from which i am very thankful to have escaped and which i count that even my illness came very luckily to put an end to <\s>
<s> and here he narrated to his friend the circumstances of the vauxhall affair with which the reader is already acquainted <\s>
<s> warrington looked very grave when he heard this story <\s>
<s> putting the moral delinquency out of the question he was extremely glad for arthur's sake that the latter had escaped from a danger which might have made his whole life wretched which certainly said warrington would have occasioned the wretchedness and ruin of the other party <\s>
<s> and your mother and and your friends what a pain it would have been to them <\s>
<s> urged pen's companion little knowing what grief and annoyance these good people had already suffered <\s>
<s> not a word to my mother <\s>
<s> pen cried out in a state of great alarm <\s>
<s> she would never get over it <\s>
<s> an esclandre of that sort would kill her i do believe <\s>
<s> and he added with a knowing air and as if like a young rascal of a lovelace he had been engaged in what are called affaires de coeur all his life the best way when a danger of that sort menaces is not to face it but to turn one's back on it and run <\s>
<s> and were you very much smitten <\s>
<s> she dropped her h's but she was a dear little girl <\s>
<s> o clarissas of this life o you poor little ignorant vain foolish maidens <\s>
<s> if you did but know the way in which the lovelaces speak of you if you could but hear jack talking to tom across the coffee room of a club or see ned taking your poor little letters out of his cigar case and handing them over to charley and billy and harry across the messroom table you would not be so eager to write or so ready to listen <\s>
<s> there's a sort of crime which is not complete unless the lucky rogue boasts of it afterwards and the man who betrays your honour in the first place is pretty sure remember that to betray your secret too <\s>
<s> it's hard to fight and it's easy to fall said warring gloomily <\s>
<s> and as you say pendennis when a danger like this is imminent the best way is to turn your back on it and run <\s>
<s> after this little discourse upon a subject about which pen would have talked a great deal more eloquently a month back the conversation reverted to the plans for going abroad and arthur eagerly pressed his friend to be of the party <\s>
<s> warrington was a part of the family a part of the cure <\s>
<s> arthur said he should not have half the pleasure without warrington <\s>
<s> but george said no he couldn't go <\s>
<s> he must stop at home and take pen's place <\s>
<s> the other remarked that that was needless for shandon was now come back to london and arthur was entitled to a holiday <\s>
<s> don't press me warrington said i can't go <\s>
<s> i'm best at home <\s>
<s> i've not got the money to travel that's the long and short of it for travelling costs money you know <\s>
<s> this little obstacle seemed fatal to pen <\s>
<s> he mentioned it to his mother mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis was very sorry mr <\s>
<s> warrington had been exceedingly kind but she supposed he knew best about his affairs <\s>
<s> and then no doubt she reproached herself for selfishness in wishing to carry the boy off and have him to herself altogether <\s>
<s> what is this i hear from pen my dear mr <\s>
<s> the major asked one day when the pair were alone and after warrington's objection had been stated to him <\s>
<s> not go with us <\s>
<s> we can't hear of such a thing pen won't get well without you <\s>
<s> i promise you i'm not going to be his nurse <\s>
<s> he must have somebody with him that's stronger and gayer and better able to amuse him than a rheumatic old fogy like me <\s>
<s> i shall go to carlsbad very likely when i've seen you people settle down <\s>
<s> travelling costs nothing nowadays or so little <\s>
<s> and and pray warrington remember that i was your father's very old friend and if you and your brother are not on such terms as to to enable you to to anticipate your younger brother's allowance i beg you to make me your banker for hasn't pen been getting into your debt these three weeks past during which you have been doing what he informs me is his work with such exemplary talent and genius begad <\s>
<s> still in spite of this kind offer and unheard of generosity on the part of the major george warrington refused and said he would stay at home <\s>
<s> but it was with a faltering voice and an irresolute accent which showed how much he would like to go though his tongue persisted in saying nay <\s>
<s> but the major's persevering benevolence was not to be baulked in this way <\s>
<s> at the tea table that evening helen happening to be absent from the room for the moment looking for pen who had gone to roost old pendennis returned to the charge and rated warrington for refusing to join in their excursion <\s>
<s> isn't it ungallant miss bell <\s>
<s> he said turning to that young lady <\s>
<s> here we have been the happiest party in the world and this odious selfish creature breaks it up <\s>
<s> miss bell's long eyelashes looked down towards her teacup and warrington blushed hugely but did not speak <\s>
<s> neither did miss bell speak but when he blushed she blushed too <\s>
<s> you ask him to come my dear said the benevolent old gentleman and then perhaps he will listen to you why should mr <\s>
<s> warrington listen to me <\s>
<s> asked the young lady putting the query to her teaspoon seemingly and not to the major <\s>
<s> ask him you have not asked him said pen's artless uncle <\s>
<s> i should be very glad indeed if mr <\s>
<s> warrington would come remarked laura to the teaspoon <\s>
<s> she looked up and said yes <\s>
<s> i will go anywhere you ask me or do anything said george lowly and forcing out the words as if they gave him pain <\s>
<s> old pendennis was delighted the affectionate old creature clapped his hands and cried bravo <\s>
<s> it's a bargain a bargain begad <\s>
<s> shake hands on it young people <\s>
<s> and laura with a look full of tender brightness put out her hand to warrington <\s>
<s> he took hers his face indicated a strange agitation <\s>
<s> he seemed to be about to speak when from pen's neighbouring room helen entered looking at them as the candle which she held lighted her pale frightened face <\s>
<s> laura blushed more red than ever and withdrew her hand <\s>
<s> it's a bargain we have been making my dear creature said the major in his most caressing voice <\s>
<s> we have just bound over mr <\s>
<s> warrington in a promise to come abroad with us <\s>
<s> in which fanny engages a new medical man could helen have suspected that with pen's returning strength his unhappy partiality for little fanny would also reawaken <\s>

<s> it was in consequence of one of many altercations in which martha's eloquence shone and in which therefore she was frequently pleased to indulge that francis refused to take his pupils to bearleader's green where mr <\s>
<s> coacher's living was and where bell was in the habit of spending the summer and he bethought him that he would pass the vacation at his aunt's village which he had not seen for many years not since little helen was a girl and used to sit on his knee <\s>
<s> down then he came and lived with them <\s>
<s> helen was grown a beautiful young woman now <\s>
<s> the cousins were nearly four months together from june to october <\s>
<s> they walked in the summer evenings they met in the early morn <\s>
<s> they read out of the same book when the old lady dozed at night over the candles <\s>
<s> what little helen knew frank taught her <\s>
<s> she sang to him she gave her artless heart to him <\s>
<s> she was aware of all his story <\s>
<s> had he made any secret had he not shown the picture of the woman to whom he was engaged and with a blush her letters hard eager and cruel the days went on and on happier and closer with more kindness more confidence and more pity <\s>
<s> at last one morning in october came when francis went back to college and the poor girl felt that her tender heart was gone with him <\s>
<s> frank too wakened up from the delightful midsummer dream to the horrible reality of his own pain <\s>
<s> he gnashed and tore at the chain which bound him <\s>
<s> he was frantic to break it and be free <\s>
<s> should he confess give his savings to the woman to whom he was bound and beg his release there was time yet he temporised <\s>
<s> no living might fall in for years to come <\s>
<s> the cousins went on corresponding sadly and fondly the betrothed woman hard jealous and dissatisfied complaining bitterly and with reason of her francis's altered tone <\s>
<s> at last things came to a crisis and the new attachment was discovered <\s>
<s> francis owned it cared not to disguise it rebuked martha with her violent temper and angry imperiousness and worst of all with her inferiority and her age <\s>
<s> her reply was that if he did not keep his promise she would carry his letters into every court in the kingdom letters in which his love was pledged to her ten thousand times and after exposing him to the world as the perjurer and traitor he was she would kill herself <\s>
<s> frank had one more interview with helen whose mother was dead then and who was living companion with old lady pontypool one more interview where it was resolved that he was to do his duty that is to redeem his vow that is to pay a debt cozened from him by a sharper that is to make two honest people miserable <\s>
<s> so the two judged their duty to be and they parted <\s>
<s> the living fell in only too soon but yet frank bell was quite a grey and worn out man when he was inducted into it <\s>

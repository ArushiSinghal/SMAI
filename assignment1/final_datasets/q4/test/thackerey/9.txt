<s> how strange the epigraphs look in those half boyish hands and what a thrill the sight of the documents gives one after the lapse of a few lustres <\s>
<s> how fate since that time has removed some estranged others dealt awfully with all <\s>
<s> many a hand is cold that wrote those kindly memorials and that we pressed in the confident and generous grasp of youthful friendship <\s>
<s> what passions our friendships were in those old days how artless and void of doubt <\s>
<s> how the arm you were never tired of having linked in yours under the fair college avenues or by the river side where it washes magdalen gardens or christ church meadows or winds by trinity and king's was withdrawn of necessity when you entered presently the world and each parted to push and struggle for himself through the great mob on the way through life <\s>
<s> are we the same men now that wrote those inscriptions that read those poems <\s>
<s> that delivered or heard those essays and speeches so simple so pompous so ludicrously solemn parodied so artlessly from books and spoken with smug chubby faces and such an admirable aping of wisdom and gravity <\s>
<s> here is the book before me it is scarcely fifteen years old <\s>
<s> here is jack moaning with despair and byronic misanthropy whose career at the university was one of unmixed milk punch <\s>
<s> here is tom's daring essay in defence of suicide and of republicanism in general apropos of the death of roland and the girondins tom's who wears the starchest tie in all the diocese and would go to smithfield rather than eat a beefsteak on a friday in lent <\s>

<s> his name is still remembered at the union debating club as one of the brilliant orators of his day <\s>
<s> by the way from having been an ardent tory in his freshman's year his principles took a sudden turn afterwards and he became a liberal of the most violent order <\s>

<s> a man may be famous in the honour lists and entirely unknown to the undergraduates who elect kings and chieftains of their own whom they admire and obey as negro gangs have private black sovereigns in their own body to whom they pay an occult obedience besides that which they publicly profess for their owners and drivers <\s>

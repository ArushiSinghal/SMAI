<s> and there's this too you villain cried the old gentleman <\s>
<s> in the desk to which the valet pointed was a little double barrelled pistol which had belonged to pendennis's old patron the indian commander in chief and which had accompanied him in many a campaign <\s>
<s> one more word you scoundrel and i'll shoot you like a mad dog <\s>
<s> stop by jove i'll do it now <\s>
<s> you'll assault me will you <\s>
<s> you'll strike at an old man will you you lying coward <\s>
<s> kneel down and say your prayers sir for by the lord you shall die <\s>
<s> the major's face glared with rage at his adversary who looked terrified before him for a moment and at the next with a shriek of murder <\s>
<s> sprang towards the open window under which a policeman happened to be on his beat <\s>
<s> to his surprise major pendennis wheeled away the table and walked to the other window which was also open <\s>
<s> he beckoned the policeman <\s>
<s> come up here policeman he said and then went and placed himself against the door <\s>
<s> you miserable sneak he said to morgan the pistol hasn't been loaded these fifteen years as you would have known very well if you had not been such a coward <\s>
<s> that policeman is coming and i will have him up and have your trunks searched i have reason to believe that you are a thief sir <\s>
<s> i know you are <\s>
<s> i'll swear to the things <\s>
<s> you gave em to me you gave em to me <\s>
<s> we'll see he said and the guilty valet remembered some fine lawn fronted shirts a certain gold headed cane an opera glass which he had forgotten to bring down and of which he had assumed the use along with certain articles of his master's clothes which the old dandy neither wore nor asked for <\s>
<s> policeman x entered followed by the seared mrs <\s>
<s> brixham and her maid of all work who had been at the door and found some difficulty in closing it against the street amateurs who wished to see the row <\s>
<s> the major began instantly to speak <\s>
<s> i have had occasion to discharge this drunken scoundrel he said <\s>
<s> both last night and this morning he insulted and assaulted me <\s>
<s> i am an old man and took up a pistol <\s>
<s> you see it is not loaded and this coward cried out before he was hurt <\s>
<s> i am glad you are come <\s>
<s> i was charging him with taking my property and desired to examine his trunks and his room <\s>
<s> the velvet cloak you ain't worn these three years nor the weskits and i thought i might take the shirts and i i take my hoath i intended to put back the hopera glass roared morgan writhing with rage and terror <\s>
<s> the man acknowledges that he is a thief the major said calmly <\s>
<s> he has been in my service for years and i have treated him with every kindness and confidence <\s>
<s> we will go upstairs and examine his trunks <\s>
<s> in those trunks mr <\s>
<s> morgan had things which he would fain keep from public eyes <\s>
<s> morgan the bill discounter gave goods as well as money to his customers <\s>
<s> he provided young spendthrifts with snuff boxes and pins and jewels and pictures and cigars and of a very doubtful quality those cigars and jewels and pictures were <\s>
<s> their display at a police office the discovery of his occult profession and the exposure of the major's property which he had appropriated indeed rather than stolen would not have added to the reputation of mr <\s>
<s> he looked a piteous image of terror and discomfiture <\s>
<s> he'll smash me will he <\s>
<s> i'll crush him now and finish with him <\s>
<s> he looked at poor mrs <\s>
<s> brixham's scared face and he thought for a moment to himself that the man brought to bay and in prison might make disclosures which had best be kept secret and that it was best not to deal too fiercely with a desperate man <\s>
<s> stop he said policeman <\s>
<s> i'll speak with this man by himself <\s>
<s> do you give mr <\s>
<s> i have brought no charge as yet the major said with a significant look at his man <\s>

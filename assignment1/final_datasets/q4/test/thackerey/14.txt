<s> it seemed natural somehow that he should be self willed and should have his own way <\s>
<s> and under his waywardness and selfishness indeed there was a kind and generous heart <\s>
<s> o it was hard that such a diamond should be changed away against such a false stone as this <\s>
<s> in a word laura began to be tired of her admired blanche <\s>
<s> she had assayed her and found her not true and her former admiration and delight which she had expressed with her accustomed generous artlessness gave way to a feeling which we shall not call contempt but which was very near it and which caused laura to adopt towards miss amory a grave and tranquil tone of superiority which was at first by no means to the muse's liking <\s>
<s> nobody likes to be found out or having held a high place to submit to step down <\s>
<s> the consciousness that this event was impending did not serve to increase miss blanche's good humour and as it made her peevish and dissatisfied with herself it probably rendered her even less agreeable to the persons round about her <\s>
<s> so there arose one fatal day a battle royal between dearest blanche and dearest laura in which the friendship between them was all but slain outright <\s>
<s> dearest blanche had been unusually capricious and wicked on this day <\s>
<s> she had been insolent to her mother savage with little frank odiously impertinent in her behaviour to the boy's governess and intolerably cruel to pincott her attendant <\s>
<s> not venturing to attack her friend for the little tyrant was of a timid feline nature and only used her claws upon those who were weaker than herself she maltreated all these and especially poor pincott who was menial confidante companion slave always according to the caprice of her young mistress <\s>
<s> this girl who had been sitting in the room with the young ladies being driven thence in tears occasioned by the cruelty of her mistress and raked with a parting sarcasm as she went sobbing from the door laura fairly broke out into a loud and indignant invective wondered how one so young could forget the deference owing to her elders as well as to her inferiors in station and professing so much sensibility of her own could torture the feelings of others so wantonly <\s>
<s> laura told her friend that her conduct was absolutely wicked and that she ought to ask pardon of heaven on her knees for it <\s>
<s> and having delivered herself of a hot and voluble speech whereof the delivery astonished the speaker as much almost as her auditor she ran to her bonnet and shawl and went home across the park in a great flurry and perturbation and to the surprise of mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis who had not expected her until night <\s>
<s> alone with helen laura gave an account of the scene and gave up her friend henceforth <\s>
<s> o mamma she said you were right blanche who seems so soft and so kind is as you have said selfish and cruel <\s>
<s> she who is always speaking of her affections can have no heart <\s>
<s> no honest girl would afflict a mother so or torture a dependant and and i give her up from this day and i will have no other friend but you <\s>
<s> on this the two ladies went through the osculatory ceremony which they were in the habit of performing and mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis got a great secret comfort from the little quarrel for laura's confession seemed to say that girl can never be a wife for pen for she is light minded and heartless and quite unworthy of our noble hero <\s>
<s> he will be sure to find out her unworthiness for his own part and then he will be saved from this flighty creature and awake out of his delusion <\s>
<s> but miss laura did not tell mrs <\s>
<s> pendennis perhaps did not acknowledge to herself what had been the real cause of the day's quarrel <\s>
<s> being in a very wicked mood and bent upon mischief everywhere the little wicked muse of a blanche had very soon begun her tricks <\s>
<s> her darling laura had come to pass a long day and as they were sitting in her own room together had chosen to bring the conversation round to the subject of mr <\s>
<s> i am afraid he is sadly fickle miss blanche observed mrs <\s>
<s> pybus and many more clavering people have told us all about the actress <\s>
<s> i was quite a child when it happened and i don't know anything about it laura answered blushing very much <\s>
<s> he used her very ill blanche said wagging her little head <\s>
<s> he was false to her <\s>
<s> i am sure he was not laura cried out he acted most generously by her he wanted to give up everything to marry her <\s>
<s> it was she that was false to him <\s>
<s> he nearly broke his heart about it he i thought you didn't know anything about the story dearest interposed miss blanche <\s>
<s> mamma has said so said laura <\s>
<s> well he is very clever continued the other little dear what a sweet poet he is <\s>
<s> have you ever read his poems <\s>
<s> only the fisherman and the diver which he translated for us and his prize poem which didn't get the prize and indeed i thought it very pompous and prosy laura said laughing <\s>
<s> has he never written you any poems then love <\s>
<s> no my dear said miss bell <\s>
<s> blanche ran up to her friend kissed her fondly called her my dearest laura at least three times looked her archly in the face nodded her head and said promise to tell no o body and i will show you something <\s>
<s> and tripping across the room daintily to a little mother of pearl inlaid desk she opened it with a silver key and took out two or three papers crumpled and rather stained with green which she submitted to her friend <\s>
<s> laura took them and read them <\s>
<s> they were love verses sure enough something about undine about a naiad about a river <\s>
<s> she looked at them for a long time but in truth the lines were not very distinct before her eyes <\s>
<s> and you have answered them blanche <\s>
<s> she asked putting them back <\s>
<s> not for worlds dearest the other said and when her dearest laura had quite done with the verses she tripped back and popped them again into the pretty desk <\s>
<s> then she went to her piano and sang two or three songs of rossini whose flourishes of music her flexible little voice could execute to perfection and laura sate by vaguely listening as she performed these pieces <\s>
<s> what was miss bell thinking about the while <\s>
<s> she hardly knew but sate there silent as the songs rolled by <\s>
<s> after this concert the young ladies were summoned to the room where luncheon was served and whither they of course went with their arms round each other's waists <\s>
<s> and it could not have been jealousy or anger on laura's part which had made her silent for after they had tripped along the corridor and descended the steps and were about to open the door which leads into the hall laura paused and looking her friend kindly and frankly in the face kissed her with a sisterly warmth <\s>

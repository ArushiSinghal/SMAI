<s> then of the harlequin's head boys there was jack rackstraw who knew of a pair of horses which the colonel must buy tom fleet whose satirical paper the swell wanted but two hundred pounds of capital to be worth a thousand a year to any man with such a power and influence colonel you rogue and the entree of the green rooms in london tom urged whilst little moss abiams entreated the colonel not to listen to these absurd fellows with their humbugging speculations but to invest his money in some good bills which moss could get for him and which would return him fifty per cent as safe as the bank of england <\s>
<s> each and all of these worthies came round the colonel with their various blandishments but he had courage enough to resist them and to button up his notes in the pocket of his coat and go home to strong and sport the outer door of the chambers <\s>
<s> honest strong had given his fellow lodger good advice about all his acquaintances and though when pressed he did not mind frankly taking twenty pounds himself out of the colonel's winnings strong was a great deal too upright to let others cheat him <\s>
<s> he was not a bad fellow when in good fortune this altamont <\s>
<s> he ordered a smart livery for grady and made poor old costigan shed tears of quickly dried gratitude by giving him a five pound note after a snug dinner at the back kitchen and he bought a green shawl for mrs <\s>

<s> and a short time after this upon her birthday which happened in the month of june miss amory received from a friend a parcel containing an enormous brass inlaid writing desk in which there was a set of amethysts the most hideous eyes ever looked upon a musical snuff box and two keepsakes of the year before last and accompanied with a couple of gown pieces of the most astounding colours the receipt of which goods made the sylphide laugh and wonder immoderately <\s>
<s> now it is a fact that colonel altamont had made a purchase of cigars and french silks from some duffers in fleet street about this period and he was found by strong in the open auction room in cheapside having invested some money in two desks several pairs of richly plated candlesticks a dinner epergne and a bagatelle board <\s>
<s> the dinner epergne remained at chambers and figured at the banquets there which the colonel gave pretty freely <\s>
<s> it seemed beautiful in his eyes until jack holt said it looked as if it had been taken in a bill <\s>
<s> and jack holt certainly knew <\s>
<s> the dinners were pretty frequent at chambers and sir francis clavering condescended to partake of them constantly <\s>
<s> his own house was shut up the successor of mirobolant who had sent in his bills so prematurely was dismissed by the indignant lady clavering the luxuriance of the establishment was greatly pruned and reduced <\s>

<s> after paying the baronet's debts the settlement of which occasioned considerable public scandal and caused the baronet to sink even lower in the world's estimation than he had been before lady clavering quitted london for tunbridge wells in high dudgeon refusing to see her reprobate husband whom nobody pitied <\s>
<s> clavering remained in london patiently by no means anxious to meet his wife's just indignation and sneaked in and out of the house of commons whence he and captain raff and mr <\s>
<s> marker would go to have a game at billiards and a cigar or showed in the sporting public houses or might be seen lurking about lincoln's inn and his lawyers where the principals kept him for hours waiting and the clerks winked at each other as he sate in their office <\s>
<s> no wonder that he relished the dinners at shepherd's inn and was perfectly resigned there resigned <\s>
<s> he was so happy nowhere else he was wretched amongst his equals who scorned him but here he was the chief guest at the table where they continually addressed him with yes sir francis and no sir francis where he told his wretched jokes and where he quavered his dreary little french song after strong had sung his jovial chorus and honest costigan had piped his irish ditties <\s>
<s> such a jolly menage as strong's with grady's irish stew and the chevalier's brew of punch after dinner would have been welcome to many a better man than clavering the solitude of whose great house at home frightened him where he was attended only by the old woman who kept the house and his valet who sneered at him <\s>
<s> yes dammit said he to his friends in shepherd's inn that fellow of mine i must turn him away only i owe him two years wages curse him and can't ask my lady <\s>
<s> he brings me my tea cold of a morning with a dem'd leaden teaspoon and he says my lady's sent all the plate to the banker's because it ain't safe now ain't it hard that she won't trust me with a single teaspoon ain't it ungentlemanlike altamont <\s>

<s> i'm sure he'll live to be hanged he deserves to be hanged all those infernal rascals of valets <\s>
<s> he was very kind to altamont now he listened to the colonel's loud stories when altamont described how when he was working his way home once from new zealand where he had been on a whaling expedition he and his comrades had been obliged to slink on board at night to escape from their wives by jove and how the poor devils put out in their canoes when they saw the ship under sail and paddled madly after her how he had been lost in the bush once for three months in new south wales when he was there once on a trading speculation how he had seen boney at saint helena and been presented to him with the rest of the officers of the indiaman of which he was a mate to all these tales and over his cups altamont told many of them and it must be owned lied and bragged a great deal sir francis now listened with great attention making a point of drinking wine with altamont at dinner and of treating him with every distinction <\s>
<s> leave him alone i know what he's a coming to altamont said laughing to strong who remonstrated with him and leave me alone i know what i'm a telling very well <\s>

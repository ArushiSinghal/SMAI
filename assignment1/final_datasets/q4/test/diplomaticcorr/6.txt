<s> gentlemen i once more put pen to paper not to attempt what is absolutely beyond the power of language to paint my distressed situation here totally destitute of intelligence or instructions from you since i left america except mr morris letters of the 4th and 5th of june last covering duplicates of my first instructions <\s>
<s> nor will i complain for myself but must plainly inform you that the cause of the united colonies or united states has for some time suffered at this court for want of positive orders to me or some other person <\s>
<s> it has not suffered here only but at several other courts that are not only willing but even desirous of assisting america <\s>
<s> common complaisance say they though they want none of our assistance requires that they should announce to us _in form their being independent states that we may know how to treat their subjects and their property in our dominions <\s>
<s> every excuse which my barren invention could suggest has been made and i have presented memoir after memoir on the situation of american affairs and their importance to this kingdom and to some others <\s>
<s> my representations as well verbally as written have been favorably received and all the attention paid them i could have wished but the _sine qua non is wanting a power to treat from the united independent states of america <\s>
<s> how say they is it possible that all your intelligence and instructions should be intercepted when we daily have advice of american vessels arriving in different ports in europe <\s>
<s> it is true i have effected what nothing but the real desire this court has of giving aid could have brought about but at the same time it has been a critical and delicate affair and has required all attention to save appearances and more than once have i been on the brink of losing all from suspicions that you were not in earnest in making applications here <\s>
<s> i will only add that a vessel with a commission from the congress has been detained in bilboa as a pirate and complaint against it carried to the court of madrid <\s>
<s> i have been applied to for assistance and though i am in hopes nothing will be determined against us yet i confess i tremble to think how important a question is by this step agitated without any one empowered to appear in a proper character and put in a defence <\s>
<s> could i present your declaration of independence and shew my commission subsequently empowering me to appear in your behalf all might be concluded at once and a most important point gained no less than that of obtaining a free reception and defence or protection of our ships of war in these ports <\s>
<s> i have written heretofore for twenty thousand hogsheads of tobacco <\s>
<s> i now repeat my desire and for a large quantity of rice <\s>
<s> the very profits on a large quantity of these articles will go far towards an annual expense <\s>
<s> the stores concerning which i have repeatedly written to you are now shipping and will be with you i trust in january as will the officers coming with them <\s>
<s> i refer to your serious consideration the enclosed hints respecting a naval force in these seas also the enclosed propositions which were by accident thrown in my way <\s>
<s> if you shall judge them of any consequence you will lay them before congress if not postage will be all the expense extra <\s>
<s> i believe they have been seen by other persons and therefore i held it my duty to send them to you <\s>
<s> my most profound respect and highest esteem ever attend the congress and particularly the secret committee <\s>

<s> s doctor bancroft has been so kind as to pay me a second visit and that most seasonably as my former assistant mr carmichael has gone to amsterdam and thence northward on a particular affair of very great importance <\s>
<s> the vessel referred to is commanded by captain lee of newburyport who on his passage took five prizes of value and sent them back but brought on two of the captains and some of the men prisoners to bilboa where the captains entered their protest and complained against captain lee as a pirate on which his vessel is detained and his commission c <\s>
<s> sent up to madrid <\s>
<s> this instantly brings on a question as to the legality of the commissions if determined legal a most important point is gained if the reverse the consequences will be very bad and the only ground on which the determination can go against the captain is that the united states of america or their congress are not known in europe as being independent states otherwise than by common fame in newspapers c on which a serious resolution cannot be grounded <\s>
<s> the best therefore that the captain expects will be to get the matter delayed which is very hard on the brave captain and his honest owners and will be a bad precedent for others who may venture into the european seas <\s>
<s> i have done every thing in my power and am in hopes from the strong assurances given me that all will be settled to my satisfaction in this affair but cannot but feel on the occasion as well for the captain as for the public <\s>
<s> i have been told repeatedly i was too anxious and advised _rester sans inquietude but i view this as a capital affair in its consequences and though i wish it i cannot take advice <\s>
<s> warlike preparations are daily making in this kingdom and in spain in the latter immediately against the portuguese but they will most probably in their consequences involve other powers <\s>
<s> i need not urge _the importance of immediate remittances towards paying for the large quantity of stores i have engaged for and depend this winter will not be suffered to slip away unimproved <\s>

<s> dear sir since receiving yours of the 4th and 5th of august last i have written you repeatedly and have no doubt of your receipt of my letters to which i refer you <\s>
<s> you are in the neighborhood of st vincents and i learn that the caribs are not contented with their masters and being an artful as well as revengeful people would undoubtedly take this opportunity of throwing off a yoke which nothing but a superior force can keep on them <\s>
<s> my request is that you would inquire into the state of that island by proper emissaries and if the caribs are disposed to revolt encourage them and promise them aid of arms and ammunition <\s>
<s> this must tear from great britain an island which they value next to jamaica and to which indeed they have no title but what rests on violence and cruelty <\s>
<s> at any rate they will oblige great britain to withdraw part of her forces from the continent <\s>
<s> if any thing can be effected there inform me instantly and i will order to your care such a quantity of stores as you shall think necessary <\s>

<s> deant two hundred tons of a necessary article to be at your orders for use of the congress the freight is to be paid in martinique as customary and i wish you to ship it for the ports of the colonies in such a manner and in such quantities in a vessel as you shall judge most prudent advising the congress of your having received it and the methods you are taking to ship it to them praying them to remit you the amount of the freight as you must make friends in martinique for advancing the same <\s>
<s> i wish you could write me oftener and inform me very particularly what letters you receive from me directed immediately to you and what letters for other persons <\s>

<s> gentlemen i have purchased two hundred tons of powder and ordered the same to be shipped to martinique to the care of mons <\s>
<s> deant to the direction of mr bingham for your use <\s>
<s> the first cost is 18 sols per lb <\s>

<s> flour is already from 20 to 23 livres per cwt <\s>
<s> i have engaged a sale for 20,000 hogsheads of tobacco the amount of which will establish the credit of the congress with the mercantile interest in france and holland <\s>
<s> let me urge your attention to these articles though i must say your silence ever since the 5th of last june discourages me at times <\s>
<s> indeed it well nigh distracts me <\s>
<s> from whatever cause the silence has happened it has greatly prejudiced the affairs of the united colonies of america and so far as the success of our cause depended on the friendship and aid of powers on this side the globe it has occasioned the greatest hazard and danger and thrown me into a state of anxiety and perplexity which no words can express <\s>
<s> i have made one excuse after another until my invention is exhausted and when i find vessels arriving from different ports in america which sailed late in august without a line for me it gives our friends here apprehensions that the assertions of our enemies who say you are negotiating and compounding are true otherwise say they where are your letters and directions <\s>
<s> surely they add if the colonies were in earnest and unanimous in their independence even if they wanted no assistance from hence common civility would cause them to announce in form their being independent states <\s>
<s> i will make no other comment on the distressing subject than this were there no hopes of obtaining assistance on application in a public manner i should be easier under your silence but when the reverse is the case to lose the present critically favorable moment and hazard thereby the ruin of the greatest cause in which mankind were ever engaged distresses my soul and i would if possible express something of what i have undergone for the last three months until hope itself has almost deserted me <\s>

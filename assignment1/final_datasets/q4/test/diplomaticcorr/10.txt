<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>
<s> it will also appear that mr lee himself wrote and signed the letter desiring they might be inserted and that he afterwards had a private conference with m <\s>

<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>

<s> sir i received your letter of the 7th instant in which you informed me that mine of the same date to you was by congress ordered to lie on the table until the examination of mr carmichael should be finished <\s>
<s> though totally unable even to conjecture what relation the examination of that gentleman can possibly have to those abusive and injurious letters written by mr izard and mr lee yet as i had so often troubled congress during a three months attendance with my repeated solicitations to be heard i forbore repeating them until neither my health my interest nor my honor will permit me a much longer stay in america i have therefore taken the liberty of enclosing my answers to the letters of those gentlemen <\s>
<s> it pains me to be obliged to answer at all and it grieves me exceedingly to be deprived of the opportunity of doing it in person i still hope to be indulged before leaving america <\s>
<s> i have only further to inform congress that i shall go into the country tomorrow for a few days that having engaged a passage in a ship which will sail for france sometime next month i propose to leave philadelphia in a few days after i return from the country in order to embark and shall esteem myself honored by congress if they have any thing further in which i may be of service to my country if they will favor me with their commands <\s>

<s> philadelphia 12th october 1778 <\s>
<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>
<s> it will also appear that mr lee himself wrote and signed the letter desiring they might be inserted and that he afterwards had a private conference with m <\s>
<s> if therefore pilots can be sent to meet him on his arrival it will be of the utmost service to the expedition <\s>
<s> i shall embark this afternoon in company with his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard for philadelphia and hope soon to have the honor of paying my respects to your excellency and the honorable congress in person and to congratulate you on the late glorious events <\s>
<s> i have sent commodore nicholson express who can inform you of our situation <\s>
<s> permit me to recommend him as an active spirited officer to whom the admiral has been much obliged by his services during our passage <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be with the most profound respect your excellency's most obedient and very humble servant silas deane <\s>
<s> s his excellency the admiral desires that on the arrival of the pilots at the hook where they will find his fleet they would make a signal with a white flag either on board their boat if they have one or from the shore formed in a triangle <\s>

<s> in this situation i continued until the 15th of august when i received the order of congress to attend them on the 17th on which day and on the 21st i had the honor personally to inform congress generally of my public transactions under their authority from the time of my departure from philadelphia in march 1776 until my return <\s>
<s> in these audiences i particularly stated and explained the unsettled state in which the commercial transactions of the commissioners in europe were at my departure and that as well from their nature and extent as that even at my departure from paris many large orders were not completed and of consequence neither the accounts or vouchers delivered that the interval between my receiving my order of recall and my departure in compliance with it was so short as to render it impossible for me to arrange those affairs further than to be able to give a general state of them which i then mentioned generally and added that i was under the necessity of returning speedily to europe as well on account of those as of other important affairs left by my sudden departure in an unsettled state <\s>
<s> at my last audience i found and expected that i should be called upon to answer questions which might be put to me for the obtaining more clear and explicit information than what i had given of some particulars in my general narration and i held myself in readiness to attend the pleasure of congress for that purpose <\s>
<s> in this situation my private affairs pressed my immediate departure from philadelphia and my public as well as private affairs in europe no less urged my departure from america <\s>
<s> on the 8th of september i took the liberty of reminding that honorable body that i was still waiting to receive their orders if they desired my further attendance upon them and my affairs daily pressing on the 11th of september i again reminded congress of my waiting their pleasure and took the liberty of mentioning the reasons that pressed me to be anxious for their immediate decision <\s>
<s> as congress have not thought proper to make any reply to my letters nor to admit me to lay before them such further information as they may desire and i am enabled to give and as from the many weighty affairs upon their hands it is uncertain when i may be admitted and as my concerns will not permit my longer continuance in philadelphia i take the liberty of enclosing to your excellency the account of the banker in whose hands all the public monies were deposited of which i gave you some time since a general state for your private information and which i obtained from the banker but a day or two before my departure from paris with the view of giving all the information in my power on every subject to congress in which they were interested and which account i expected in the course of my narration to have delivered personally to congress <\s>
<s> as to any other subject on which further information may be desired i shall be ready to give it whenever that honorable body shall call on me for it during the short time my affairs will permit me to tarry in this city <\s>

<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>

<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>
<s> it will also appear that mr lee himself wrote and signed the letter desiring they might be inserted and that he afterwards had a private conference with m <\s>
<s> if therefore pilots can be sent to meet him on his arrival it will be of the utmost service to the expedition <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>

<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>

<s> in these audiences i particularly stated and explained the unsettled state in which the commercial transactions of the commissioners in europe were at my departure and that as well from their nature and extent as that even at my departure from paris many large orders were not completed and of consequence neither the accounts or vouchers delivered that the interval between my receiving my order of recall and my departure in compliance with it was so short as to render it impossible for me to arrange those affairs further than to be able to give a general state of them which i then mentioned generally and added that i was under the necessity of returning speedily to europe as well on account of those as of other important affairs left by my sudden departure in an unsettled state <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>

<s> in this situation i continued until the 15th of august when i received the order of congress to attend them on the 17th on which day and on the 21st i had the honor personally to inform congress generally of my public transactions under their authority from the time of my departure from philadelphia in march 1776 until my return <\s>
<s> in these audiences i particularly stated and explained the unsettled state in which the commercial transactions of the commissioners in europe were at my departure and that as well from their nature and extent as that even at my departure from paris many large orders were not completed and of consequence neither the accounts or vouchers delivered that the interval between my receiving my order of recall and my departure in compliance with it was so short as to render it impossible for me to arrange those affairs further than to be able to give a general state of them which i then mentioned generally and added that i was under the necessity of returning speedily to europe as well on account of those as of other important affairs left by my sudden departure in an unsettled state <\s>
<s> at my last audience i found and expected that i should be called upon to answer questions which might be put to me for the obtaining more clear and explicit information than what i had given of some particulars in my general narration and i held myself in readiness to attend the pleasure of congress for that purpose <\s>
<s> in this situation my private affairs pressed my immediate departure from philadelphia and my public as well as private affairs in europe no less urged my departure from america <\s>
<s> on the 8th of september i took the liberty of reminding that honorable body that i was still waiting to receive their orders if they desired my further attendance upon them and my affairs daily pressing on the 11th of september i again reminded congress of my waiting their pleasure and took the liberty of mentioning the reasons that pressed me to be anxious for their immediate decision <\s>
<s> as congress have not thought proper to make any reply to my letters nor to admit me to lay before them such further information as they may desire and i am enabled to give and as from the many weighty affairs upon their hands it is uncertain when i may be admitted and as my concerns will not permit my longer continuance in philadelphia i take the liberty of enclosing to your excellency the account of the banker in whose hands all the public monies were deposited of which i gave you some time since a general state for your private information and which i obtained from the banker but a day or two before my departure from paris with the view of giving all the information in my power on every subject to congress in which they were interested and which account i expected in the course of my narration to have delivered personally to congress <\s>

<s> sir in consequence of an order of congress on the 8th of december 1777 for me to embrace the first opportunity of returning to america and upon my arrival to repair with all possible despatch to congress that they might be well informed of the state of affairs in europe in that critical juncture i left paris the 1st of april last having received the order on the 4th of march preceding and arrived in philadelphia the seat of congress on the 13th of july following ready at the pleasure of congress to render such information as was in my power to give <\s>
<s> in this situation i continued until the 15th of august when i received the order of congress to attend them on the 17th on which day and on the 21st i had the honor personally to inform congress generally of my public transactions under their authority from the time of my departure from philadelphia in march 1776 until my return <\s>
<s> in these audiences i particularly stated and explained the unsettled state in which the commercial transactions of the commissioners in europe were at my departure and that as well from their nature and extent as that even at my departure from paris many large orders were not completed and of consequence neither the accounts or vouchers delivered that the interval between my receiving my order of recall and my departure in compliance with it was so short as to render it impossible for me to arrange those affairs further than to be able to give a general state of them which i then mentioned generally and added that i was under the necessity of returning speedily to europe as well on account of those as of other important affairs left by my sudden departure in an unsettled state <\s>
<s> at my last audience i found and expected that i should be called upon to answer questions which might be put to me for the obtaining more clear and explicit information than what i had given of some particulars in my general narration and i held myself in readiness to attend the pleasure of congress for that purpose <\s>
<s> in this situation my private affairs pressed my immediate departure from philadelphia and my public as well as private affairs in europe no less urged my departure from america <\s>
<s> on the 8th of september i took the liberty of reminding that honorable body that i was still waiting to receive their orders if they desired my further attendance upon them and my affairs daily pressing on the 11th of september i again reminded congress of my waiting their pleasure and took the liberty of mentioning the reasons that pressed me to be anxious for their immediate decision <\s>
<s> as congress have not thought proper to make any reply to my letters nor to admit me to lay before them such further information as they may desire and i am enabled to give and as from the many weighty affairs upon their hands it is uncertain when i may be admitted and as my concerns will not permit my longer continuance in philadelphia i take the liberty of enclosing to your excellency the account of the banker in whose hands all the public monies were deposited of which i gave you some time since a general state for your private information and which i obtained from the banker but a day or two before my departure from paris with the view of giving all the information in my power on every subject to congress in which they were interested and which account i expected in the course of my narration to have delivered personally to congress <\s>
<s> as to any other subject on which further information may be desired i shall be ready to give it whenever that honorable body shall call on me for it during the short time my affairs will permit me to tarry in this city <\s>
<s> i have indeed thought that some further information would be necessary i have daily expected to be called upon for it <\s>
<s> on this consideration alone i have notwithstanding the pressing circumstances i have found myself in waited with patience the orders of congress <\s>
<s> i shall be happy if such information or any other service in my power may be found agreeable and of use to that respectable body and the united states to whom i have long since and ever shall be devoted <\s>
<s> i have only further to request that honorable body to be assured that i shall ever retain a most grateful sense of the confidence which they have heretofore honored me with and consider it as the most honorable and happy circumstance of my life that i have had the opportunity of rendering important services to my country and that i am conscious of having done them to the utmost of my ability <\s>

<s> i have that regard for mr izard's opinion of my ability and disposition to transact public business which i ought to have and am consequently easy on that subject but facts asserted which affect either call for an explanation <\s>
<s> those indeed which respect myself personally require none before congress nor will i trouble that honorable body with the making any but those which regard my character and conduct as a public minister and in so important a transaction as that of the late treaties of paris call on me as well in justice to the public as to myself for an explanation which i am very happy in the having it in my power to give as well as in the confidence i have that congress will neither delay nor refuse doing this justice to a faithful and greatly injured servant of theirs <\s>

<s> though totally unable even to conjecture what relation the examination of that gentleman can possibly have to those abusive and injurious letters written by mr izard and mr lee yet as i had so often troubled congress during a three months attendance with my repeated solicitations to be heard i forbore repeating them until neither my health my interest nor my honor will permit me a much longer stay in america i have therefore taken the liberty of enclosing my answers to the letters of those gentlemen <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>
<s> it will also appear that mr lee himself wrote and signed the letter desiring they might be inserted and that he afterwards had a private conference with m <\s>
<s> if therefore pilots can be sent to meet him on his arrival it will be of the utmost service to the expedition <\s>
<s> i shall embark this afternoon in company with his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard for philadelphia and hope soon to have the honor of paying my respects to your excellency and the honorable congress in person and to congratulate you on the late glorious events <\s>
<s> i have sent commodore nicholson express who can inform you of our situation <\s>
<s> permit me to recommend him as an active spirited officer to whom the admiral has been much obliged by his services during our passage <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be with the most profound respect your excellency's most obedient and very humble servant silas deane <\s>
<s> s his excellency the admiral desires that on the arrival of the pilots at the hook where they will find his fleet they would make a signal with a white flag either on board their boat if they have one or from the shore formed in a triangle <\s>
<s> chouen who will wait on you with a letter from the admiral sets out suddenly and may want money to bear his expenses on his further journey <\s>

<s> unfortunately my passage has been much longer than i expected and i but now begin to find myself recovering from the fatigues of it yet my desire of giving congress as early as possible an account of the state of their affairs in europe when i left france as well as the peculiar situation in which my recall has placed me personally has induced me to address them through your excellency to solicit for as early an audience as the important business in which they are engaged will admit of <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>

<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>

<s> sir i received your letter of the 7th instant in which you informed me that mine of the same date to you was by congress ordered to lie on the table until the examination of mr carmichael should be finished <\s>
<s> though totally unable even to conjecture what relation the examination of that gentleman can possibly have to those abusive and injurious letters written by mr izard and mr lee yet as i had so often troubled congress during a three months attendance with my repeated solicitations to be heard i forbore repeating them until neither my health my interest nor my honor will permit me a much longer stay in america i have therefore taken the liberty of enclosing my answers to the letters of those gentlemen <\s>
<s> it pains me to be obliged to answer at all and it grieves me exceedingly to be deprived of the opportunity of doing it in person i still hope to be indulged before leaving america <\s>
<s> i have only further to inform congress that i shall go into the country tomorrow for a few days that having engaged a passage in a ship which will sail for france sometime next month i propose to leave philadelphia in a few days after i return from the country in order to embark and shall esteem myself honored by congress if they have any thing further in which i may be of service to my country if they will favor me with their commands <\s>

<s> philadelphia 12th october 1778 <\s>
<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>
<s> it will also appear that mr lee himself wrote and signed the letter desiring they might be inserted and that he afterwards had a private conference with m <\s>
<s> if therefore pilots can be sent to meet him on his arrival it will be of the utmost service to the expedition <\s>
<s> i shall embark this afternoon in company with his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard for philadelphia and hope soon to have the honor of paying my respects to your excellency and the honorable congress in person and to congratulate you on the late glorious events <\s>
<s> i have sent commodore nicholson express who can inform you of our situation <\s>
<s> permit me to recommend him as an active spirited officer to whom the admiral has been much obliged by his services during our passage <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be with the most profound respect your excellency's most obedient and very humble servant silas deane <\s>
<s> s his excellency the admiral desires that on the arrival of the pilots at the hook where they will find his fleet they would make a signal with a white flag either on board their boat if they have one or from the shore formed in a triangle <\s>

<s> in this situation i continued until the 15th of august when i received the order of congress to attend them on the 17th on which day and on the 21st i had the honor personally to inform congress generally of my public transactions under their authority from the time of my departure from philadelphia in march 1776 until my return <\s>
<s> in these audiences i particularly stated and explained the unsettled state in which the commercial transactions of the commissioners in europe were at my departure and that as well from their nature and extent as that even at my departure from paris many large orders were not completed and of consequence neither the accounts or vouchers delivered that the interval between my receiving my order of recall and my departure in compliance with it was so short as to render it impossible for me to arrange those affairs further than to be able to give a general state of them which i then mentioned generally and added that i was under the necessity of returning speedily to europe as well on account of those as of other important affairs left by my sudden departure in an unsettled state <\s>
<s> at my last audience i found and expected that i should be called upon to answer questions which might be put to me for the obtaining more clear and explicit information than what i had given of some particulars in my general narration and i held myself in readiness to attend the pleasure of congress for that purpose <\s>
<s> in this situation my private affairs pressed my immediate departure from philadelphia and my public as well as private affairs in europe no less urged my departure from america <\s>
<s> on the 8th of september i took the liberty of reminding that honorable body that i was still waiting to receive their orders if they desired my further attendance upon them and my affairs daily pressing on the 11th of september i again reminded congress of my waiting their pleasure and took the liberty of mentioning the reasons that pressed me to be anxious for their immediate decision <\s>
<s> as congress have not thought proper to make any reply to my letters nor to admit me to lay before them such further information as they may desire and i am enabled to give and as from the many weighty affairs upon their hands it is uncertain when i may be admitted and as my concerns will not permit my longer continuance in philadelphia i take the liberty of enclosing to your excellency the account of the banker in whose hands all the public monies were deposited of which i gave you some time since a general state for your private information and which i obtained from the banker but a day or two before my departure from paris with the view of giving all the information in my power on every subject to congress in which they were interested and which account i expected in the course of my narration to have delivered personally to congress <\s>
<s> as to any other subject on which further information may be desired i shall be ready to give it whenever that honorable body shall call on me for it during the short time my affairs will permit me to tarry in this city <\s>

<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>

<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>
<s> it will also appear that mr lee himself wrote and signed the letter desiring they might be inserted and that he afterwards had a private conference with m <\s>
<s> if therefore pilots can be sent to meet him on his arrival it will be of the utmost service to the expedition <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>

<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>

<s> in these audiences i particularly stated and explained the unsettled state in which the commercial transactions of the commissioners in europe were at my departure and that as well from their nature and extent as that even at my departure from paris many large orders were not completed and of consequence neither the accounts or vouchers delivered that the interval between my receiving my order of recall and my departure in compliance with it was so short as to render it impossible for me to arrange those affairs further than to be able to give a general state of them which i then mentioned generally and added that i was under the necessity of returning speedily to europe as well on account of those as of other important affairs left by my sudden departure in an unsettled state <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>

<s> in this situation i continued until the 15th of august when i received the order of congress to attend them on the 17th on which day and on the 21st i had the honor personally to inform congress generally of my public transactions under their authority from the time of my departure from philadelphia in march 1776 until my return <\s>
<s> in these audiences i particularly stated and explained the unsettled state in which the commercial transactions of the commissioners in europe were at my departure and that as well from their nature and extent as that even at my departure from paris many large orders were not completed and of consequence neither the accounts or vouchers delivered that the interval between my receiving my order of recall and my departure in compliance with it was so short as to render it impossible for me to arrange those affairs further than to be able to give a general state of them which i then mentioned generally and added that i was under the necessity of returning speedily to europe as well on account of those as of other important affairs left by my sudden departure in an unsettled state <\s>
<s> at my last audience i found and expected that i should be called upon to answer questions which might be put to me for the obtaining more clear and explicit information than what i had given of some particulars in my general narration and i held myself in readiness to attend the pleasure of congress for that purpose <\s>
<s> in this situation my private affairs pressed my immediate departure from philadelphia and my public as well as private affairs in europe no less urged my departure from america <\s>
<s> on the 8th of september i took the liberty of reminding that honorable body that i was still waiting to receive their orders if they desired my further attendance upon them and my affairs daily pressing on the 11th of september i again reminded congress of my waiting their pleasure and took the liberty of mentioning the reasons that pressed me to be anxious for their immediate decision <\s>
<s> as congress have not thought proper to make any reply to my letters nor to admit me to lay before them such further information as they may desire and i am enabled to give and as from the many weighty affairs upon their hands it is uncertain when i may be admitted and as my concerns will not permit my longer continuance in philadelphia i take the liberty of enclosing to your excellency the account of the banker in whose hands all the public monies were deposited of which i gave you some time since a general state for your private information and which i obtained from the banker but a day or two before my departure from paris with the view of giving all the information in my power on every subject to congress in which they were interested and which account i expected in the course of my narration to have delivered personally to congress <\s>

<s> sir in consequence of an order of congress on the 8th of december 1777 for me to embrace the first opportunity of returning to america and upon my arrival to repair with all possible despatch to congress that they might be well informed of the state of affairs in europe in that critical juncture i left paris the 1st of april last having received the order on the 4th of march preceding and arrived in philadelphia the seat of congress on the 13th of july following ready at the pleasure of congress to render such information as was in my power to give <\s>
<s> in this situation i continued until the 15th of august when i received the order of congress to attend them on the 17th on which day and on the 21st i had the honor personally to inform congress generally of my public transactions under their authority from the time of my departure from philadelphia in march 1776 until my return <\s>
<s> in these audiences i particularly stated and explained the unsettled state in which the commercial transactions of the commissioners in europe were at my departure and that as well from their nature and extent as that even at my departure from paris many large orders were not completed and of consequence neither the accounts or vouchers delivered that the interval between my receiving my order of recall and my departure in compliance with it was so short as to render it impossible for me to arrange those affairs further than to be able to give a general state of them which i then mentioned generally and added that i was under the necessity of returning speedily to europe as well on account of those as of other important affairs left by my sudden departure in an unsettled state <\s>
<s> at my last audience i found and expected that i should be called upon to answer questions which might be put to me for the obtaining more clear and explicit information than what i had given of some particulars in my general narration and i held myself in readiness to attend the pleasure of congress for that purpose <\s>
<s> in this situation my private affairs pressed my immediate departure from philadelphia and my public as well as private affairs in europe no less urged my departure from america <\s>
<s> on the 8th of september i took the liberty of reminding that honorable body that i was still waiting to receive their orders if they desired my further attendance upon them and my affairs daily pressing on the 11th of september i again reminded congress of my waiting their pleasure and took the liberty of mentioning the reasons that pressed me to be anxious for their immediate decision <\s>
<s> as congress have not thought proper to make any reply to my letters nor to admit me to lay before them such further information as they may desire and i am enabled to give and as from the many weighty affairs upon their hands it is uncertain when i may be admitted and as my concerns will not permit my longer continuance in philadelphia i take the liberty of enclosing to your excellency the account of the banker in whose hands all the public monies were deposited of which i gave you some time since a general state for your private information and which i obtained from the banker but a day or two before my departure from paris with the view of giving all the information in my power on every subject to congress in which they were interested and which account i expected in the course of my narration to have delivered personally to congress <\s>
<s> as to any other subject on which further information may be desired i shall be ready to give it whenever that honorable body shall call on me for it during the short time my affairs will permit me to tarry in this city <\s>
<s> i have indeed thought that some further information would be necessary i have daily expected to be called upon for it <\s>
<s> on this consideration alone i have notwithstanding the pressing circumstances i have found myself in waited with patience the orders of congress <\s>
<s> i shall be happy if such information or any other service in my power may be found agreeable and of use to that respectable body and the united states to whom i have long since and ever shall be devoted <\s>
<s> i have only further to request that honorable body to be assured that i shall ever retain a most grateful sense of the confidence which they have heretofore honored me with and consider it as the most honorable and happy circumstance of my life that i have had the opportunity of rendering important services to my country and that i am conscious of having done them to the utmost of my ability <\s>

<s> i have that regard for mr izard's opinion of my ability and disposition to transact public business which i ought to have and am consequently easy on that subject but facts asserted which affect either call for an explanation <\s>
<s> those indeed which respect myself personally require none before congress nor will i trouble that honorable body with the making any but those which regard my character and conduct as a public minister and in so important a transaction as that of the late treaties of paris call on me as well in justice to the public as to myself for an explanation which i am very happy in the having it in my power to give as well as in the confidence i have that congress will neither delay nor refuse doing this justice to a faithful and greatly injured servant of theirs <\s>

<s> though totally unable even to conjecture what relation the examination of that gentleman can possibly have to those abusive and injurious letters written by mr izard and mr lee yet as i had so often troubled congress during a three months attendance with my repeated solicitations to be heard i forbore repeating them until neither my health my interest nor my honor will permit me a much longer stay in america i have therefore taken the liberty of enclosing my answers to the letters of those gentlemen <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>
<s> it will also appear that mr lee himself wrote and signed the letter desiring they might be inserted and that he afterwards had a private conference with m <\s>
<s> if therefore pilots can be sent to meet him on his arrival it will be of the utmost service to the expedition <\s>
<s> i shall embark this afternoon in company with his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard for philadelphia and hope soon to have the honor of paying my respects to your excellency and the honorable congress in person and to congratulate you on the late glorious events <\s>
<s> i have sent commodore nicholson express who can inform you of our situation <\s>
<s> permit me to recommend him as an active spirited officer to whom the admiral has been much obliged by his services during our passage <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be with the most profound respect your excellency's most obedient and very humble servant silas deane <\s>
<s> s his excellency the admiral desires that on the arrival of the pilots at the hook where they will find his fleet they would make a signal with a white flag either on board their boat if they have one or from the shore formed in a triangle <\s>
<s> chouen who will wait on you with a letter from the admiral sets out suddenly and may want money to bear his expenses on his further journey <\s>

<s> unfortunately my passage has been much longer than i expected and i but now begin to find myself recovering from the fatigues of it yet my desire of giving congress as early as possible an account of the state of their affairs in europe when i left france as well as the peculiar situation in which my recall has placed me personally has induced me to address them through your excellency to solicit for as early an audience as the important business in which they are engaged will admit of <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>

<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>

<s> sir i received your letter of the 7th instant in which you informed me that mine of the same date to you was by congress ordered to lie on the table until the examination of mr carmichael should be finished <\s>
<s> though totally unable even to conjecture what relation the examination of that gentleman can possibly have to those abusive and injurious letters written by mr izard and mr lee yet as i had so often troubled congress during a three months attendance with my repeated solicitations to be heard i forbore repeating them until neither my health my interest nor my honor will permit me a much longer stay in america i have therefore taken the liberty of enclosing my answers to the letters of those gentlemen <\s>
<s> it pains me to be obliged to answer at all and it grieves me exceedingly to be deprived of the opportunity of doing it in person i still hope to be indulged before leaving america <\s>
<s> i have only further to inform congress that i shall go into the country tomorrow for a few days that having engaged a passage in a ship which will sail for france sometime next month i propose to leave philadelphia in a few days after i return from the country in order to embark and shall esteem myself honored by congress if they have any thing further in which i may be of service to my country if they will favor me with their commands <\s>

<s> philadelphia 12th october 1778 <\s>
<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>
<s> it will also appear that mr lee himself wrote and signed the letter desiring they might be inserted and that he afterwards had a private conference with m <\s>
<s> if therefore pilots can be sent to meet him on his arrival it will be of the utmost service to the expedition <\s>
<s> i shall embark this afternoon in company with his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard for philadelphia and hope soon to have the honor of paying my respects to your excellency and the honorable congress in person and to congratulate you on the late glorious events <\s>
<s> i have sent commodore nicholson express who can inform you of our situation <\s>
<s> permit me to recommend him as an active spirited officer to whom the admiral has been much obliged by his services during our passage <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be with the most profound respect your excellency's most obedient and very humble servant silas deane <\s>
<s> s his excellency the admiral desires that on the arrival of the pilots at the hook where they will find his fleet they would make a signal with a white flag either on board their boat if they have one or from the shore formed in a triangle <\s>

<s> in this situation i continued until the 15th of august when i received the order of congress to attend them on the 17th on which day and on the 21st i had the honor personally to inform congress generally of my public transactions under their authority from the time of my departure from philadelphia in march 1776 until my return <\s>
<s> in these audiences i particularly stated and explained the unsettled state in which the commercial transactions of the commissioners in europe were at my departure and that as well from their nature and extent as that even at my departure from paris many large orders were not completed and of consequence neither the accounts or vouchers delivered that the interval between my receiving my order of recall and my departure in compliance with it was so short as to render it impossible for me to arrange those affairs further than to be able to give a general state of them which i then mentioned generally and added that i was under the necessity of returning speedily to europe as well on account of those as of other important affairs left by my sudden departure in an unsettled state <\s>
<s> at my last audience i found and expected that i should be called upon to answer questions which might be put to me for the obtaining more clear and explicit information than what i had given of some particulars in my general narration and i held myself in readiness to attend the pleasure of congress for that purpose <\s>
<s> in this situation my private affairs pressed my immediate departure from philadelphia and my public as well as private affairs in europe no less urged my departure from america <\s>
<s> on the 8th of september i took the liberty of reminding that honorable body that i was still waiting to receive their orders if they desired my further attendance upon them and my affairs daily pressing on the 11th of september i again reminded congress of my waiting their pleasure and took the liberty of mentioning the reasons that pressed me to be anxious for their immediate decision <\s>
<s> as congress have not thought proper to make any reply to my letters nor to admit me to lay before them such further information as they may desire and i am enabled to give and as from the many weighty affairs upon their hands it is uncertain when i may be admitted and as my concerns will not permit my longer continuance in philadelphia i take the liberty of enclosing to your excellency the account of the banker in whose hands all the public monies were deposited of which i gave you some time since a general state for your private information and which i obtained from the banker but a day or two before my departure from paris with the view of giving all the information in my power on every subject to congress in which they were interested and which account i expected in the course of my narration to have delivered personally to congress <\s>
<s> as to any other subject on which further information may be desired i shall be ready to give it whenever that honorable body shall call on me for it during the short time my affairs will permit me to tarry in this city <\s>

<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>

<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>
<s> it will also appear that mr lee himself wrote and signed the letter desiring they might be inserted and that he afterwards had a private conference with m <\s>
<s> if therefore pilots can be sent to meet him on his arrival it will be of the utmost service to the expedition <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>

<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>

<s> in these audiences i particularly stated and explained the unsettled state in which the commercial transactions of the commissioners in europe were at my departure and that as well from their nature and extent as that even at my departure from paris many large orders were not completed and of consequence neither the accounts or vouchers delivered that the interval between my receiving my order of recall and my departure in compliance with it was so short as to render it impossible for me to arrange those affairs further than to be able to give a general state of them which i then mentioned generally and added that i was under the necessity of returning speedily to europe as well on account of those as of other important affairs left by my sudden departure in an unsettled state <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>

<s> in this situation i continued until the 15th of august when i received the order of congress to attend them on the 17th on which day and on the 21st i had the honor personally to inform congress generally of my public transactions under their authority from the time of my departure from philadelphia in march 1776 until my return <\s>
<s> in these audiences i particularly stated and explained the unsettled state in which the commercial transactions of the commissioners in europe were at my departure and that as well from their nature and extent as that even at my departure from paris many large orders were not completed and of consequence neither the accounts or vouchers delivered that the interval between my receiving my order of recall and my departure in compliance with it was so short as to render it impossible for me to arrange those affairs further than to be able to give a general state of them which i then mentioned generally and added that i was under the necessity of returning speedily to europe as well on account of those as of other important affairs left by my sudden departure in an unsettled state <\s>
<s> at my last audience i found and expected that i should be called upon to answer questions which might be put to me for the obtaining more clear and explicit information than what i had given of some particulars in my general narration and i held myself in readiness to attend the pleasure of congress for that purpose <\s>
<s> in this situation my private affairs pressed my immediate departure from philadelphia and my public as well as private affairs in europe no less urged my departure from america <\s>
<s> on the 8th of september i took the liberty of reminding that honorable body that i was still waiting to receive their orders if they desired my further attendance upon them and my affairs daily pressing on the 11th of september i again reminded congress of my waiting their pleasure and took the liberty of mentioning the reasons that pressed me to be anxious for their immediate decision <\s>
<s> as congress have not thought proper to make any reply to my letters nor to admit me to lay before them such further information as they may desire and i am enabled to give and as from the many weighty affairs upon their hands it is uncertain when i may be admitted and as my concerns will not permit my longer continuance in philadelphia i take the liberty of enclosing to your excellency the account of the banker in whose hands all the public monies were deposited of which i gave you some time since a general state for your private information and which i obtained from the banker but a day or two before my departure from paris with the view of giving all the information in my power on every subject to congress in which they were interested and which account i expected in the course of my narration to have delivered personally to congress <\s>

<s> sir in consequence of an order of congress on the 8th of december 1777 for me to embrace the first opportunity of returning to america and upon my arrival to repair with all possible despatch to congress that they might be well informed of the state of affairs in europe in that critical juncture i left paris the 1st of april last having received the order on the 4th of march preceding and arrived in philadelphia the seat of congress on the 13th of july following ready at the pleasure of congress to render such information as was in my power to give <\s>
<s> in this situation i continued until the 15th of august when i received the order of congress to attend them on the 17th on which day and on the 21st i had the honor personally to inform congress generally of my public transactions under their authority from the time of my departure from philadelphia in march 1776 until my return <\s>
<s> in these audiences i particularly stated and explained the unsettled state in which the commercial transactions of the commissioners in europe were at my departure and that as well from their nature and extent as that even at my departure from paris many large orders were not completed and of consequence neither the accounts or vouchers delivered that the interval between my receiving my order of recall and my departure in compliance with it was so short as to render it impossible for me to arrange those affairs further than to be able to give a general state of them which i then mentioned generally and added that i was under the necessity of returning speedily to europe as well on account of those as of other important affairs left by my sudden departure in an unsettled state <\s>
<s> at my last audience i found and expected that i should be called upon to answer questions which might be put to me for the obtaining more clear and explicit information than what i had given of some particulars in my general narration and i held myself in readiness to attend the pleasure of congress for that purpose <\s>
<s> in this situation my private affairs pressed my immediate departure from philadelphia and my public as well as private affairs in europe no less urged my departure from america <\s>
<s> on the 8th of september i took the liberty of reminding that honorable body that i was still waiting to receive their orders if they desired my further attendance upon them and my affairs daily pressing on the 11th of september i again reminded congress of my waiting their pleasure and took the liberty of mentioning the reasons that pressed me to be anxious for their immediate decision <\s>
<s> as congress have not thought proper to make any reply to my letters nor to admit me to lay before them such further information as they may desire and i am enabled to give and as from the many weighty affairs upon their hands it is uncertain when i may be admitted and as my concerns will not permit my longer continuance in philadelphia i take the liberty of enclosing to your excellency the account of the banker in whose hands all the public monies were deposited of which i gave you some time since a general state for your private information and which i obtained from the banker but a day or two before my departure from paris with the view of giving all the information in my power on every subject to congress in which they were interested and which account i expected in the course of my narration to have delivered personally to congress <\s>
<s> as to any other subject on which further information may be desired i shall be ready to give it whenever that honorable body shall call on me for it during the short time my affairs will permit me to tarry in this city <\s>
<s> i have indeed thought that some further information would be necessary i have daily expected to be called upon for it <\s>
<s> on this consideration alone i have notwithstanding the pressing circumstances i have found myself in waited with patience the orders of congress <\s>
<s> i shall be happy if such information or any other service in my power may be found agreeable and of use to that respectable body and the united states to whom i have long since and ever shall be devoted <\s>
<s> i have only further to request that honorable body to be assured that i shall ever retain a most grateful sense of the confidence which they have heretofore honored me with and consider it as the most honorable and happy circumstance of my life that i have had the opportunity of rendering important services to my country and that i am conscious of having done them to the utmost of my ability <\s>

<s> i have that regard for mr izard's opinion of my ability and disposition to transact public business which i ought to have and am consequently easy on that subject but facts asserted which affect either call for an explanation <\s>
<s> those indeed which respect myself personally require none before congress nor will i trouble that honorable body with the making any but those which regard my character and conduct as a public minister and in so important a transaction as that of the late treaties of paris call on me as well in justice to the public as to myself for an explanation which i am very happy in the having it in my power to give as well as in the confidence i have that congress will neither delay nor refuse doing this justice to a faithful and greatly injured servant of theirs <\s>

<s> though totally unable even to conjecture what relation the examination of that gentleman can possibly have to those abusive and injurious letters written by mr izard and mr lee yet as i had so often troubled congress during a three months attendance with my repeated solicitations to be heard i forbore repeating them until neither my health my interest nor my honor will permit me a much longer stay in america i have therefore taken the liberty of enclosing my answers to the letters of those gentlemen <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>
<s> it will also appear that mr lee himself wrote and signed the letter desiring they might be inserted and that he afterwards had a private conference with m <\s>
<s> if therefore pilots can be sent to meet him on his arrival it will be of the utmost service to the expedition <\s>
<s> i shall embark this afternoon in company with his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard for philadelphia and hope soon to have the honor of paying my respects to your excellency and the honorable congress in person and to congratulate you on the late glorious events <\s>
<s> i have sent commodore nicholson express who can inform you of our situation <\s>
<s> permit me to recommend him as an active spirited officer to whom the admiral has been much obliged by his services during our passage <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be with the most profound respect your excellency's most obedient and very humble servant silas deane <\s>
<s> s his excellency the admiral desires that on the arrival of the pilots at the hook where they will find his fleet they would make a signal with a white flag either on board their boat if they have one or from the shore formed in a triangle <\s>
<s> chouen who will wait on you with a letter from the admiral sets out suddenly and may want money to bear his expenses on his further journey <\s>

<s> unfortunately my passage has been much longer than i expected and i but now begin to find myself recovering from the fatigues of it yet my desire of giving congress as early as possible an account of the state of their affairs in europe when i left france as well as the peculiar situation in which my recall has placed me personally has induced me to address them through your excellency to solicit for as early an audience as the important business in which they are engaged will admit of <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>

<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>

<s> sir i received your letter of the 7th instant in which you informed me that mine of the same date to you was by congress ordered to lie on the table until the examination of mr carmichael should be finished <\s>
<s> though totally unable even to conjecture what relation the examination of that gentleman can possibly have to those abusive and injurious letters written by mr izard and mr lee yet as i had so often troubled congress during a three months attendance with my repeated solicitations to be heard i forbore repeating them until neither my health my interest nor my honor will permit me a much longer stay in america i have therefore taken the liberty of enclosing my answers to the letters of those gentlemen <\s>
<s> it pains me to be obliged to answer at all and it grieves me exceedingly to be deprived of the opportunity of doing it in person i still hope to be indulged before leaving america <\s>
<s> i have only further to inform congress that i shall go into the country tomorrow for a few days that having engaged a passage in a ship which will sail for france sometime next month i propose to leave philadelphia in a few days after i return from the country in order to embark and shall esteem myself honored by congress if they have any thing further in which i may be of service to my country if they will favor me with their commands <\s>

<s> philadelphia 12th october 1778 <\s>
<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>
<s> it will also appear that mr lee himself wrote and signed the letter desiring they might be inserted and that he afterwards had a private conference with m <\s>
<s> if therefore pilots can be sent to meet him on his arrival it will be of the utmost service to the expedition <\s>
<s> i shall embark this afternoon in company with his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard for philadelphia and hope soon to have the honor of paying my respects to your excellency and the honorable congress in person and to congratulate you on the late glorious events <\s>
<s> i have sent commodore nicholson express who can inform you of our situation <\s>
<s> permit me to recommend him as an active spirited officer to whom the admiral has been much obliged by his services during our passage <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be with the most profound respect your excellency's most obedient and very humble servant silas deane <\s>
<s> s his excellency the admiral desires that on the arrival of the pilots at the hook where they will find his fleet they would make a signal with a white flag either on board their boat if they have one or from the shore formed in a triangle <\s>

<s> in this situation i continued until the 15th of august when i received the order of congress to attend them on the 17th on which day and on the 21st i had the honor personally to inform congress generally of my public transactions under their authority from the time of my departure from philadelphia in march 1776 until my return <\s>
<s> in these audiences i particularly stated and explained the unsettled state in which the commercial transactions of the commissioners in europe were at my departure and that as well from their nature and extent as that even at my departure from paris many large orders were not completed and of consequence neither the accounts or vouchers delivered that the interval between my receiving my order of recall and my departure in compliance with it was so short as to render it impossible for me to arrange those affairs further than to be able to give a general state of them which i then mentioned generally and added that i was under the necessity of returning speedily to europe as well on account of those as of other important affairs left by my sudden departure in an unsettled state <\s>
<s> at my last audience i found and expected that i should be called upon to answer questions which might be put to me for the obtaining more clear and explicit information than what i had given of some particulars in my general narration and i held myself in readiness to attend the pleasure of congress for that purpose <\s>
<s> in this situation my private affairs pressed my immediate departure from philadelphia and my public as well as private affairs in europe no less urged my departure from america <\s>
<s> on the 8th of september i took the liberty of reminding that honorable body that i was still waiting to receive their orders if they desired my further attendance upon them and my affairs daily pressing on the 11th of september i again reminded congress of my waiting their pleasure and took the liberty of mentioning the reasons that pressed me to be anxious for their immediate decision <\s>
<s> as congress have not thought proper to make any reply to my letters nor to admit me to lay before them such further information as they may desire and i am enabled to give and as from the many weighty affairs upon their hands it is uncertain when i may be admitted and as my concerns will not permit my longer continuance in philadelphia i take the liberty of enclosing to your excellency the account of the banker in whose hands all the public monies were deposited of which i gave you some time since a general state for your private information and which i obtained from the banker but a day or two before my departure from paris with the view of giving all the information in my power on every subject to congress in which they were interested and which account i expected in the course of my narration to have delivered personally to congress <\s>
<s> as to any other subject on which further information may be desired i shall be ready to give it whenever that honorable body shall call on me for it during the short time my affairs will permit me to tarry in this city <\s>

<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>

<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>
<s> it will also appear that mr lee himself wrote and signed the letter desiring they might be inserted and that he afterwards had a private conference with m <\s>
<s> if therefore pilots can be sent to meet him on his arrival it will be of the utmost service to the expedition <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>

<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>

<s> in these audiences i particularly stated and explained the unsettled state in which the commercial transactions of the commissioners in europe were at my departure and that as well from their nature and extent as that even at my departure from paris many large orders were not completed and of consequence neither the accounts or vouchers delivered that the interval between my receiving my order of recall and my departure in compliance with it was so short as to render it impossible for me to arrange those affairs further than to be able to give a general state of them which i then mentioned generally and added that i was under the necessity of returning speedily to europe as well on account of those as of other important affairs left by my sudden departure in an unsettled state <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>

<s> in this situation i continued until the 15th of august when i received the order of congress to attend them on the 17th on which day and on the 21st i had the honor personally to inform congress generally of my public transactions under their authority from the time of my departure from philadelphia in march 1776 until my return <\s>
<s> in these audiences i particularly stated and explained the unsettled state in which the commercial transactions of the commissioners in europe were at my departure and that as well from their nature and extent as that even at my departure from paris many large orders were not completed and of consequence neither the accounts or vouchers delivered that the interval between my receiving my order of recall and my departure in compliance with it was so short as to render it impossible for me to arrange those affairs further than to be able to give a general state of them which i then mentioned generally and added that i was under the necessity of returning speedily to europe as well on account of those as of other important affairs left by my sudden departure in an unsettled state <\s>
<s> at my last audience i found and expected that i should be called upon to answer questions which might be put to me for the obtaining more clear and explicit information than what i had given of some particulars in my general narration and i held myself in readiness to attend the pleasure of congress for that purpose <\s>
<s> in this situation my private affairs pressed my immediate departure from philadelphia and my public as well as private affairs in europe no less urged my departure from america <\s>
<s> on the 8th of september i took the liberty of reminding that honorable body that i was still waiting to receive their orders if they desired my further attendance upon them and my affairs daily pressing on the 11th of september i again reminded congress of my waiting their pleasure and took the liberty of mentioning the reasons that pressed me to be anxious for their immediate decision <\s>
<s> as congress have not thought proper to make any reply to my letters nor to admit me to lay before them such further information as they may desire and i am enabled to give and as from the many weighty affairs upon their hands it is uncertain when i may be admitted and as my concerns will not permit my longer continuance in philadelphia i take the liberty of enclosing to your excellency the account of the banker in whose hands all the public monies were deposited of which i gave you some time since a general state for your private information and which i obtained from the banker but a day or two before my departure from paris with the view of giving all the information in my power on every subject to congress in which they were interested and which account i expected in the course of my narration to have delivered personally to congress <\s>

<s> sir in consequence of an order of congress on the 8th of december 1777 for me to embrace the first opportunity of returning to america and upon my arrival to repair with all possible despatch to congress that they might be well informed of the state of affairs in europe in that critical juncture i left paris the 1st of april last having received the order on the 4th of march preceding and arrived in philadelphia the seat of congress on the 13th of july following ready at the pleasure of congress to render such information as was in my power to give <\s>
<s> in this situation i continued until the 15th of august when i received the order of congress to attend them on the 17th on which day and on the 21st i had the honor personally to inform congress generally of my public transactions under their authority from the time of my departure from philadelphia in march 1776 until my return <\s>
<s> in these audiences i particularly stated and explained the unsettled state in which the commercial transactions of the commissioners in europe were at my departure and that as well from their nature and extent as that even at my departure from paris many large orders were not completed and of consequence neither the accounts or vouchers delivered that the interval between my receiving my order of recall and my departure in compliance with it was so short as to render it impossible for me to arrange those affairs further than to be able to give a general state of them which i then mentioned generally and added that i was under the necessity of returning speedily to europe as well on account of those as of other important affairs left by my sudden departure in an unsettled state <\s>
<s> at my last audience i found and expected that i should be called upon to answer questions which might be put to me for the obtaining more clear and explicit information than what i had given of some particulars in my general narration and i held myself in readiness to attend the pleasure of congress for that purpose <\s>
<s> in this situation my private affairs pressed my immediate departure from philadelphia and my public as well as private affairs in europe no less urged my departure from america <\s>
<s> on the 8th of september i took the liberty of reminding that honorable body that i was still waiting to receive their orders if they desired my further attendance upon them and my affairs daily pressing on the 11th of september i again reminded congress of my waiting their pleasure and took the liberty of mentioning the reasons that pressed me to be anxious for their immediate decision <\s>
<s> as congress have not thought proper to make any reply to my letters nor to admit me to lay before them such further information as they may desire and i am enabled to give and as from the many weighty affairs upon their hands it is uncertain when i may be admitted and as my concerns will not permit my longer continuance in philadelphia i take the liberty of enclosing to your excellency the account of the banker in whose hands all the public monies were deposited of which i gave you some time since a general state for your private information and which i obtained from the banker but a day or two before my departure from paris with the view of giving all the information in my power on every subject to congress in which they were interested and which account i expected in the course of my narration to have delivered personally to congress <\s>
<s> as to any other subject on which further information may be desired i shall be ready to give it whenever that honorable body shall call on me for it during the short time my affairs will permit me to tarry in this city <\s>
<s> i have indeed thought that some further information would be necessary i have daily expected to be called upon for it <\s>
<s> on this consideration alone i have notwithstanding the pressing circumstances i have found myself in waited with patience the orders of congress <\s>
<s> i shall be happy if such information or any other service in my power may be found agreeable and of use to that respectable body and the united states to whom i have long since and ever shall be devoted <\s>
<s> i have only further to request that honorable body to be assured that i shall ever retain a most grateful sense of the confidence which they have heretofore honored me with and consider it as the most honorable and happy circumstance of my life that i have had the opportunity of rendering important services to my country and that i am conscious of having done them to the utmost of my ability <\s>

<s> i have that regard for mr izard's opinion of my ability and disposition to transact public business which i ought to have and am consequently easy on that subject but facts asserted which affect either call for an explanation <\s>
<s> those indeed which respect myself personally require none before congress nor will i trouble that honorable body with the making any but those which regard my character and conduct as a public minister and in so important a transaction as that of the late treaties of paris call on me as well in justice to the public as to myself for an explanation which i am very happy in the having it in my power to give as well as in the confidence i have that congress will neither delay nor refuse doing this justice to a faithful and greatly injured servant of theirs <\s>

<s> though totally unable even to conjecture what relation the examination of that gentleman can possibly have to those abusive and injurious letters written by mr izard and mr lee yet as i had so often troubled congress during a three months attendance with my repeated solicitations to be heard i forbore repeating them until neither my health my interest nor my honor will permit me a much longer stay in america i have therefore taken the liberty of enclosing my answers to the letters of those gentlemen <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>
<s> it will also appear that mr lee himself wrote and signed the letter desiring they might be inserted and that he afterwards had a private conference with m <\s>
<s> if therefore pilots can be sent to meet him on his arrival it will be of the utmost service to the expedition <\s>
<s> i shall embark this afternoon in company with his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard for philadelphia and hope soon to have the honor of paying my respects to your excellency and the honorable congress in person and to congratulate you on the late glorious events <\s>
<s> i have sent commodore nicholson express who can inform you of our situation <\s>
<s> permit me to recommend him as an active spirited officer to whom the admiral has been much obliged by his services during our passage <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be with the most profound respect your excellency's most obedient and very humble servant silas deane <\s>
<s> s his excellency the admiral desires that on the arrival of the pilots at the hook where they will find his fleet they would make a signal with a white flag either on board their boat if they have one or from the shore formed in a triangle <\s>
<s> chouen who will wait on you with a letter from the admiral sets out suddenly and may want money to bear his expenses on his further journey <\s>

<s> unfortunately my passage has been much longer than i expected and i but now begin to find myself recovering from the fatigues of it yet my desire of giving congress as early as possible an account of the state of their affairs in europe when i left france as well as the peculiar situation in which my recall has placed me personally has induced me to address them through your excellency to solicit for as early an audience as the important business in which they are engaged will admit of <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>

<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>

<s> sir i received your letter of the 7th instant in which you informed me that mine of the same date to you was by congress ordered to lie on the table until the examination of mr carmichael should be finished <\s>
<s> though totally unable even to conjecture what relation the examination of that gentleman can possibly have to those abusive and injurious letters written by mr izard and mr lee yet as i had so often troubled congress during a three months attendance with my repeated solicitations to be heard i forbore repeating them until neither my health my interest nor my honor will permit me a much longer stay in america i have therefore taken the liberty of enclosing my answers to the letters of those gentlemen <\s>
<s> it pains me to be obliged to answer at all and it grieves me exceedingly to be deprived of the opportunity of doing it in person i still hope to be indulged before leaving america <\s>
<s> i have only further to inform congress that i shall go into the country tomorrow for a few days that having engaged a passage in a ship which will sail for france sometime next month i propose to leave philadelphia in a few days after i return from the country in order to embark and shall esteem myself honored by congress if they have any thing further in which i may be of service to my country if they will favor me with their commands <\s>

<s> philadelphia 12th october 1778 <\s>
<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>
<s> it will also appear that mr lee himself wrote and signed the letter desiring they might be inserted and that he afterwards had a private conference with m <\s>
<s> if therefore pilots can be sent to meet him on his arrival it will be of the utmost service to the expedition <\s>
<s> i shall embark this afternoon in company with his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard for philadelphia and hope soon to have the honor of paying my respects to your excellency and the honorable congress in person and to congratulate you on the late glorious events <\s>
<s> i have sent commodore nicholson express who can inform you of our situation <\s>
<s> permit me to recommend him as an active spirited officer to whom the admiral has been much obliged by his services during our passage <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be with the most profound respect your excellency's most obedient and very humble servant silas deane <\s>
<s> s his excellency the admiral desires that on the arrival of the pilots at the hook where they will find his fleet they would make a signal with a white flag either on board their boat if they have one or from the shore formed in a triangle <\s>

<s> in this situation i continued until the 15th of august when i received the order of congress to attend them on the 17th on which day and on the 21st i had the honor personally to inform congress generally of my public transactions under their authority from the time of my departure from philadelphia in march 1776 until my return <\s>
<s> in these audiences i particularly stated and explained the unsettled state in which the commercial transactions of the commissioners in europe were at my departure and that as well from their nature and extent as that even at my departure from paris many large orders were not completed and of consequence neither the accounts or vouchers delivered that the interval between my receiving my order of recall and my departure in compliance with it was so short as to render it impossible for me to arrange those affairs further than to be able to give a general state of them which i then mentioned generally and added that i was under the necessity of returning speedily to europe as well on account of those as of other important affairs left by my sudden departure in an unsettled state <\s>
<s> at my last audience i found and expected that i should be called upon to answer questions which might be put to me for the obtaining more clear and explicit information than what i had given of some particulars in my general narration and i held myself in readiness to attend the pleasure of congress for that purpose <\s>
<s> in this situation my private affairs pressed my immediate departure from philadelphia and my public as well as private affairs in europe no less urged my departure from america <\s>
<s> on the 8th of september i took the liberty of reminding that honorable body that i was still waiting to receive their orders if they desired my further attendance upon them and my affairs daily pressing on the 11th of september i again reminded congress of my waiting their pleasure and took the liberty of mentioning the reasons that pressed me to be anxious for their immediate decision <\s>
<s> as congress have not thought proper to make any reply to my letters nor to admit me to lay before them such further information as they may desire and i am enabled to give and as from the many weighty affairs upon their hands it is uncertain when i may be admitted and as my concerns will not permit my longer continuance in philadelphia i take the liberty of enclosing to your excellency the account of the banker in whose hands all the public monies were deposited of which i gave you some time since a general state for your private information and which i obtained from the banker but a day or two before my departure from paris with the view of giving all the information in my power on every subject to congress in which they were interested and which account i expected in the course of my narration to have delivered personally to congress <\s>
<s> as to any other subject on which further information may be desired i shall be ready to give it whenever that honorable body shall call on me for it during the short time my affairs will permit me to tarry in this city <\s>

<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>

<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>
<s> it will also appear that mr lee himself wrote and signed the letter desiring they might be inserted and that he afterwards had a private conference with m <\s>
<s> if therefore pilots can be sent to meet him on his arrival it will be of the utmost service to the expedition <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>

<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>

<s> in these audiences i particularly stated and explained the unsettled state in which the commercial transactions of the commissioners in europe were at my departure and that as well from their nature and extent as that even at my departure from paris many large orders were not completed and of consequence neither the accounts or vouchers delivered that the interval between my receiving my order of recall and my departure in compliance with it was so short as to render it impossible for me to arrange those affairs further than to be able to give a general state of them which i then mentioned generally and added that i was under the necessity of returning speedily to europe as well on account of those as of other important affairs left by my sudden departure in an unsettled state <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>

<s> in this situation i continued until the 15th of august when i received the order of congress to attend them on the 17th on which day and on the 21st i had the honor personally to inform congress generally of my public transactions under their authority from the time of my departure from philadelphia in march 1776 until my return <\s>
<s> in these audiences i particularly stated and explained the unsettled state in which the commercial transactions of the commissioners in europe were at my departure and that as well from their nature and extent as that even at my departure from paris many large orders were not completed and of consequence neither the accounts or vouchers delivered that the interval between my receiving my order of recall and my departure in compliance with it was so short as to render it impossible for me to arrange those affairs further than to be able to give a general state of them which i then mentioned generally and added that i was under the necessity of returning speedily to europe as well on account of those as of other important affairs left by my sudden departure in an unsettled state <\s>
<s> at my last audience i found and expected that i should be called upon to answer questions which might be put to me for the obtaining more clear and explicit information than what i had given of some particulars in my general narration and i held myself in readiness to attend the pleasure of congress for that purpose <\s>
<s> in this situation my private affairs pressed my immediate departure from philadelphia and my public as well as private affairs in europe no less urged my departure from america <\s>
<s> on the 8th of september i took the liberty of reminding that honorable body that i was still waiting to receive their orders if they desired my further attendance upon them and my affairs daily pressing on the 11th of september i again reminded congress of my waiting their pleasure and took the liberty of mentioning the reasons that pressed me to be anxious for their immediate decision <\s>
<s> as congress have not thought proper to make any reply to my letters nor to admit me to lay before them such further information as they may desire and i am enabled to give and as from the many weighty affairs upon their hands it is uncertain when i may be admitted and as my concerns will not permit my longer continuance in philadelphia i take the liberty of enclosing to your excellency the account of the banker in whose hands all the public monies were deposited of which i gave you some time since a general state for your private information and which i obtained from the banker but a day or two before my departure from paris with the view of giving all the information in my power on every subject to congress in which they were interested and which account i expected in the course of my narration to have delivered personally to congress <\s>

<s> sir in consequence of an order of congress on the 8th of december 1777 for me to embrace the first opportunity of returning to america and upon my arrival to repair with all possible despatch to congress that they might be well informed of the state of affairs in europe in that critical juncture i left paris the 1st of april last having received the order on the 4th of march preceding and arrived in philadelphia the seat of congress on the 13th of july following ready at the pleasure of congress to render such information as was in my power to give <\s>
<s> in this situation i continued until the 15th of august when i received the order of congress to attend them on the 17th on which day and on the 21st i had the honor personally to inform congress generally of my public transactions under their authority from the time of my departure from philadelphia in march 1776 until my return <\s>
<s> in these audiences i particularly stated and explained the unsettled state in which the commercial transactions of the commissioners in europe were at my departure and that as well from their nature and extent as that even at my departure from paris many large orders were not completed and of consequence neither the accounts or vouchers delivered that the interval between my receiving my order of recall and my departure in compliance with it was so short as to render it impossible for me to arrange those affairs further than to be able to give a general state of them which i then mentioned generally and added that i was under the necessity of returning speedily to europe as well on account of those as of other important affairs left by my sudden departure in an unsettled state <\s>
<s> at my last audience i found and expected that i should be called upon to answer questions which might be put to me for the obtaining more clear and explicit information than what i had given of some particulars in my general narration and i held myself in readiness to attend the pleasure of congress for that purpose <\s>
<s> in this situation my private affairs pressed my immediate departure from philadelphia and my public as well as private affairs in europe no less urged my departure from america <\s>
<s> on the 8th of september i took the liberty of reminding that honorable body that i was still waiting to receive their orders if they desired my further attendance upon them and my affairs daily pressing on the 11th of september i again reminded congress of my waiting their pleasure and took the liberty of mentioning the reasons that pressed me to be anxious for their immediate decision <\s>
<s> as congress have not thought proper to make any reply to my letters nor to admit me to lay before them such further information as they may desire and i am enabled to give and as from the many weighty affairs upon their hands it is uncertain when i may be admitted and as my concerns will not permit my longer continuance in philadelphia i take the liberty of enclosing to your excellency the account of the banker in whose hands all the public monies were deposited of which i gave you some time since a general state for your private information and which i obtained from the banker but a day or two before my departure from paris with the view of giving all the information in my power on every subject to congress in which they were interested and which account i expected in the course of my narration to have delivered personally to congress <\s>
<s> as to any other subject on which further information may be desired i shall be ready to give it whenever that honorable body shall call on me for it during the short time my affairs will permit me to tarry in this city <\s>
<s> i have indeed thought that some further information would be necessary i have daily expected to be called upon for it <\s>
<s> on this consideration alone i have notwithstanding the pressing circumstances i have found myself in waited with patience the orders of congress <\s>
<s> i shall be happy if such information or any other service in my power may be found agreeable and of use to that respectable body and the united states to whom i have long since and ever shall be devoted <\s>
<s> i have only further to request that honorable body to be assured that i shall ever retain a most grateful sense of the confidence which they have heretofore honored me with and consider it as the most honorable and happy circumstance of my life that i have had the opportunity of rendering important services to my country and that i am conscious of having done them to the utmost of my ability <\s>

<s> i have that regard for mr izard's opinion of my ability and disposition to transact public business which i ought to have and am consequently easy on that subject but facts asserted which affect either call for an explanation <\s>
<s> those indeed which respect myself personally require none before congress nor will i trouble that honorable body with the making any but those which regard my character and conduct as a public minister and in so important a transaction as that of the late treaties of paris call on me as well in justice to the public as to myself for an explanation which i am very happy in the having it in my power to give as well as in the confidence i have that congress will neither delay nor refuse doing this justice to a faithful and greatly injured servant of theirs <\s>

<s> though totally unable even to conjecture what relation the examination of that gentleman can possibly have to those abusive and injurious letters written by mr izard and mr lee yet as i had so often troubled congress during a three months attendance with my repeated solicitations to be heard i forbore repeating them until neither my health my interest nor my honor will permit me a much longer stay in america i have therefore taken the liberty of enclosing my answers to the letters of those gentlemen <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>
<s> it will also appear that mr lee himself wrote and signed the letter desiring they might be inserted and that he afterwards had a private conference with m <\s>
<s> if therefore pilots can be sent to meet him on his arrival it will be of the utmost service to the expedition <\s>
<s> i shall embark this afternoon in company with his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard for philadelphia and hope soon to have the honor of paying my respects to your excellency and the honorable congress in person and to congratulate you on the late glorious events <\s>
<s> i have sent commodore nicholson express who can inform you of our situation <\s>
<s> permit me to recommend him as an active spirited officer to whom the admiral has been much obliged by his services during our passage <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be with the most profound respect your excellency's most obedient and very humble servant silas deane <\s>
<s> s his excellency the admiral desires that on the arrival of the pilots at the hook where they will find his fleet they would make a signal with a white flag either on board their boat if they have one or from the shore formed in a triangle <\s>
<s> chouen who will wait on you with a letter from the admiral sets out suddenly and may want money to bear his expenses on his further journey <\s>

<s> unfortunately my passage has been much longer than i expected and i but now begin to find myself recovering from the fatigues of it yet my desire of giving congress as early as possible an account of the state of their affairs in europe when i left france as well as the peculiar situation in which my recall has placed me personally has induced me to address them through your excellency to solicit for as early an audience as the important business in which they are engaged will admit of <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>

<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>

<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>

<s> sir i received your letter of the 7th instant in which you informed me that mine of the same date to you was by congress ordered to lie on the table until the examination of mr carmichael should be finished <\s>
<s> though totally unable even to conjecture what relation the examination of that gentleman can possibly have to those abusive and injurious letters written by mr izard and mr lee yet as i had so often troubled congress during a three months attendance with my repeated solicitations to be heard i forbore repeating them until neither my health my interest nor my honor will permit me a much longer stay in america i have therefore taken the liberty of enclosing my answers to the letters of those gentlemen <\s>
<s> it pains me to be obliged to answer at all and it grieves me exceedingly to be deprived of the opportunity of doing it in person i still hope to be indulged before leaving america <\s>
<s> i have only further to inform congress that i shall go into the country tomorrow for a few days that having engaged a passage in a ship which will sail for france sometime next month i propose to leave philadelphia in a few days after i return from the country in order to embark and shall esteem myself honored by congress if they have any thing further in which i may be of service to my country if they will favor me with their commands <\s>
<s> i have the honor to remain c <\s>
<s> to the president of congress <\s>
<s> philadelphia 12th october 1778 <\s>
<s> sir in the extracts from the letters of the honorable mr izard i find charges which respect me supported by his opinions and by what he declares to have heard from the honorable arthur lee who by his own account is my irreconcilable enemy <\s>
<s> i find also charges against the honorable dr franklin and myself jointly supported on the same grounds with this difference that almost every complaint against us lies equally against mr lee and it is worthy of remark that where the charge lies equally against us all mr izard leaves mr lee wholly out and fixing it solely on dr franklin and myself proceeds to represent the doctor as entirely under my influence <\s>
<s> my situation has through the whole been peculiarly unfortunate and in nothing more so than in this that mr izard's letters written as much with the design of impeaching dr franklin's conduct as mine now operates solely against me <\s>
<s> mr izard says in his letter of the first of april _that if the whole world had been searched it would have been impossible to have found a person more unfit than i was for the trust with which congress had honored me <\s>
<s> it does not become me and possibly not even mr izard himself to determine on my competency to that trust and i have only to observe that both of us were appointed by the authority of congress with this only difference that i had the honor of being personally known to the members who composed that body and i can add with pleasure that i always paid respect to mr izard from the choice they had made of him which i doubt not was on good information <\s>
<s> i shall feel no uneasiness on my own account that mr izard's opinions of me remain on the journals of congress whilst on the same records there will be found that of his most christian majesty of his minister and secretary of state and of my venerable colleague revered through europe as the first of patriots as well as philosophers whom this age has produced <\s>
<s> i find but two charges which respect me personally the first is the exercising such a degree of hauteur and presumption as to give offence to every gentleman with whom i transacted business <\s>
<s> i transacted none with mr izard and therefore must appeal from his opinion to the business i transacted and the worthy and honorable persons with whom i transacted it and who from the first of my acquaintance with them to my leaving the kingdom honored me with their friendship and their confidence <\s>
<s> i desire it may be remembered that when i went abroad charged with the transaction of political and commercial business for congress in the year 1776 i arrived at paris as late in the season as the month of july without funds uncertain of remittances without credit ignorant of the language and manners of france and an utter stranger to the persons in power and influence at court that i had not the patronage of any person of importance and had no correspondence or connexions established in any part of europe <\s>
<s> the news of our misfortunes in canada arrived in france with me and that of our subsequent misfortunes immediately after and was as usual exaggerated by the british ambassador and his emissaries <\s>
<s> in a word without remittances or even intelligence from congress and under all these disagreeable circumstances i had to oppose the artifice the influence and the power of great britain yet i have the pleasing reflection that before the first of december following i procured thirty thousand stand of arms thirty thousand suits of clothes more than two hundred and fifty pieces of brass artillery tents and other stores to a large amount provided the ships to transport them and shipped a great part of them for america <\s>
<s> many of these supplies fortunately arrived at the commencement of the last year's operations and enabled my brave countrymen in some parts of america to make a good stand against the enemy and in the north to acquire immortal renown by the defeat and surrender of general burgoyne and his whole army an event peculiarly fortunate in its consequences as it accelerated the completion of that alliance to which the honorable congress with every true friend to the united states have given their approbation <\s>
<s> during this short period i had established a very extensive correspondence for the service of my country not only in france but in holland at the court of russia and elsewhere in europe and though the grant of money by the court of versailles was not at this time actually made i had entered upon the negotiation and laid the foundation for obtaining it <\s>
<s> these facts without mentioning others of no less importance will shew what business i transacted and the character given me by those great personages with whom i was in my public character connected will evince the degree of reputation in which i stood <\s>
<s> it is my misfortune that mr izard was of a different opinion <\s>
<s> the second charge is that mr arthur lee had assured him that his despatches to congress and even one of his private letters had been opened by me <\s>
<s> i am surprised mr arthur lee never intimated this to me and that he should communicate it to mr izard to be reported in this manner <\s>
<s> i think it however sufficient for me to say here what i shall say elsewhere and on all occasions that this is a groundless calumny which i should not have expected even from an enemy at least not from a candid or generous one <\s>
<s> mr izard complains that dr franklin and myself concealed from him or attempted to conceal the opportunities of writing to america as well as the intelligence received from thence <\s>
<s> in reply to this it need only be observed that no packets or letters were sent by the commissioners to america and to congress without the knowledge and consent of mr arthur lee and no intelligence received to which he was not privy <\s>
<s> that he was often with mr izard and therefore it was naturally to be supposed would give him every necessary information if mr lee did not acquaint mr izard he is at least equally culpable with us and if he did there is no ground for the complaint <\s>
<s> it is true that neither dr franklin nor myself considered ourselves at liberty to communicate the treaty or its contents until the consent of the court should be had we considered ourselves in the same situation as to the appointment of mons <\s>
<s> gerard and the sailing of the toulon fleet <\s>
<s> mr izard appears however to have been well informed of the former at least and that very early and of the latter on the day of our leaving paris <\s>
<s> mr arthur lee knew of it sometime before as he wrote many letters by his excellency mons <\s>
<s> in justice therefore the complaint ought not to have been made solely against dr franklin and mr deane and particularly against the latter <\s>
<s> mr izard represents that there were dissensions and misunderstandings between the commissioners at paris <\s>
<s> he is of opinion that the interest of the public suffered by it but in this he is mistaken as the treaty itself and all our other public transactions will demonstrate <\s>
<s> mr izard is of opinion that france might have been brought to have taken an active part much earlier <\s>
<s> if circumstances not in our power had taken place earlier they possibly might but even in that case they would have done it under great disadvantages as is evident from the representation i made to congress when i had the honor of being heard on the 19th of august last <\s>
<s> as the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty are complained of and as this subject immediately interests the public i have drawn up a concise narration of the whole of that transaction and have communicated it to his excellency mons <\s>
<s> gerard who agrees to the truth of every part thereof which has come to his knowledge <\s>
<s> this i beg leave to present to congress as it will show that mr izard had not the best information and that neither dr franklin or myself though born in new england procured the insertion of those articles it will further show that the court of france never urged it but on the contrary left us perfectly free to have them both inserted or both omitted <\s>
<s> it will also appear that mr lee himself wrote and signed the letter desiring they might be inserted and that he afterwards had a private conference with m <\s>

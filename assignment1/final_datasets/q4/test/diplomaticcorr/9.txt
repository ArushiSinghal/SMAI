<s> you know that when i left america the naval armaments were but beginning by the congress and the inquiry was hardly made even by individuals whether foreign powers would admit our cruisers and their prizes <\s>
<s> after my arrival the question was first started by captain lee of marblehead at bilboa of which i gave you an account in my letters of october and november last <\s>
<s> captain lee carried no prize into bilboa with him and the question turned simply on the complaint of the english consul charging him with having committed acts of piracy on the high seas in making prizes of english vessels <\s>
<s> the commissary or governor of the port detained his vessel and sent to court for directions and received orders to set the vessel at liberty which orders were accompanied with a general declaration that his catholic majesty was neuter in the dispute between england and america <\s>
<s> though the issue of this business was favorable it was not direct to the point we wished to establish the declaration of neutrality to be general <\s>
<s> in my letters of october and november last some of which must have been received i repeatedly gave my sentiments in favor of sending cruisers into these seas <\s>
<s> the first that arrived was the reprisal with two prizes this caused much speculation and at our first audience after we were told that by the treaties subsisting between france and england ships of war belonging to any foreign power at war with either could not be admitted into their ports unless driven by stress of weather or want of provisions c <\s>
<s> and that in such case they could not be permitted to stay longer than twenty four hours or until they had taken on board the provisions necessary to carry them to the nearest port of their respective states c <\s>
<s> as you will see in the treaty of commerce of 1713 confirmed by all the subsequent treaties <\s>
<s> at the same time we were given to understand that every favor and indulgence compatible with the treaties would be shewn us and that ways might be found out to dispose of those prizes without giving public offence to england <\s>
<s> the hint was taken the prizes disposed of and the reprisal repaired and fitted for another cruise which she made on the coast of spain taking among other english prizes the packet boat from lisbon with which captain wickes returned to port l'orient <\s>
<s> on this the english ambassador complained loudly and the english merchants were alarmed <\s>
<s> insurance rose in london and it was generally supposed that there would be a restitution of the prizes and detention of captain wickes or a declaration of war <\s>
<s> this court then ordered the prizes as well as capt <\s>
<s> wickes to leave the port in twenty four hours <\s>
<s> the former were sent out but sold to french merchants and captain wickes his ship being leaky was permitted to stay <\s>
<s> soon after this captain johnson arrived in the lexington and we having bought a cutter with a view of sending her out as a packet altered our resolution and equipped her as a cruiser and sent her and the lexington out under the command of captain wickes as commodore with the design of intercepting the irish linen ships but by contrary winds and mistaking the time of the sailing of those ships they were unsuccessful as to the main object but as they sailed quite round ireland and took or destroyed seventeen or eighteen sail of vessels they most effectually alarmed england prevented the great fair at chester occasioned insurance to rise and even deterred the english merchants from shipping goods in english bottoms at any rate so that in a few weeks forty sail of french ships were loading in the thames on freight an instance never before known <\s>
<s> but upon this the english ambassador complained in a higher tone and gave us much difficulty the prizes however were disposed of though at a prodigious loss and captain wickes set about repairing and refitting the reprisal which had been obliged to throw over her guns and saw some of her beams to escape a seventy four gun ship which chased her and the lexington on their return from their cruise <\s>
<s> but before he was refitted orders were sent from court to detain his vessel and the lexington until further orders <\s>
<s> this was owing partly to captain wickes having repeatedly come into the ports of france with prizes and refitted his ship for fresh cruises it being directly contrary to the treaty which they pretend to hold sacred and partly to the transaction at dunkirk and the consequent threatenings of the british ministry <\s>
<s> in this situation captain wickes and captain johnson remain at present <\s>
<s> soon after mr hodge's arrival we bought a lugger at dover and sent her to dunkirk <\s>
<s> mr hodge went after her and equipped her with great secrecy designing a blow in the north sea <\s>
<s> he sent captain cunningham in her and ordered him to intercept the packet between england and holland and then to cruise northward towards the baltic <\s>
<s> cunningham fell in with the packet in a day or two after leaving dunkirk and took her <\s>
<s> as she had a prodigious number of letters on board he imagined it was proper he should return to dunkirk instead of continuing his course in his return he also took a brig of some value and brought both prizes into port <\s>
<s> this spread the alarm far and wide and gave much real ground of complaint as he had been entirely armed and equipped in dunkirk and had returned thither with his prizes <\s>
<s> the ministry therefore to appease england ordered the prizes to be returned and cunningham and his crew to be imprisoned which gave the english a temporary triumph <\s>
<s> but not discouraged thereby another cutter was bought and equipped completely in the port of dunkirk <\s>
<s> cunningham and his crew were set at liberty and with some address and intrigue he got again to sea from the same port in a swift sailing cutter mounting fourteen six pounders and twenty two swivels with one hundred and six men <\s>
<s> his first adventure greatly raised insurance on the northern trade even the packet boats from dover to calais were for some time insured <\s>
<s> on his leaving the port of dunkirk the second time he had orders to proceed directly for america but he and his crew full of resentment for the insults they had received from the enemy whilst in prison at dunkirk and afterwards attacked the first vessels they met with and plundered and burnt as they went on <\s>
<s> our last accounts are that they had taken or destroyed about twenty sail and had appeared off the town of lynn and threatened to burn it unless ransomed but the wind proving unfavorable they could not put their threats into execution <\s>
<s> in a word cunningham by his first and second bold expeditions is become the terror of all the eastern coast of england and scotland and is more dreaded than thurot was in the late war <\s>
<s> but though this distresses our enemies it embarrasses us <\s>
<s> we solicited his enlargement and mr hodge engaged for his going directly for america <\s>

<s> you know that when i left america the naval armaments were but beginning by the congress and the inquiry was hardly made even by individuals whether foreign powers would admit our cruisers and their prizes <\s>
<s> after my arrival the question was first started by captain lee of marblehead at bilboa of which i gave you an account in my letters of october and november last <\s>
<s> captain lee carried no prize into bilboa with him and the question turned simply on the complaint of the english consul charging him with having committed acts of piracy on the high seas in making prizes of english vessels <\s>
<s> the commissary or governor of the port detained his vessel and sent to court for directions and received orders to set the vessel at liberty which orders were accompanied with a general declaration that his catholic majesty was neuter in the dispute between england and america <\s>
<s> though the issue of this business was favorable it was not direct to the point we wished to establish the declaration of neutrality to be general <\s>
<s> in my letters of october and november last some of which must have been received i repeatedly gave my sentiments in favor of sending cruisers into these seas <\s>
<s> the first that arrived was the reprisal with two prizes this caused much speculation and at our first audience after we were told that by the treaties subsisting between france and england ships of war belonging to any foreign power at war with either could not be admitted into their ports unless driven by stress of weather or want of provisions c <\s>
<s> and that in such case they could not be permitted to stay longer than twenty four hours or until they had taken on board the provisions necessary to carry them to the nearest port of their respective states c <\s>
<s> as you will see in the treaty of commerce of 1713 confirmed by all the subsequent treaties <\s>
<s> at the same time we were given to understand that every favor and indulgence compatible with the treaties would be shewn us and that ways might be found out to dispose of those prizes without giving public offence to england <\s>
<s> the hint was taken the prizes disposed of and the reprisal repaired and fitted for another cruise which she made on the coast of spain taking among other english prizes the packet boat from lisbon with which captain wickes returned to port l'orient <\s>
<s> on this the english ambassador complained loudly and the english merchants were alarmed <\s>
<s> insurance rose in london and it was generally supposed that there would be a restitution of the prizes and detention of captain wickes or a declaration of war <\s>
<s> this court then ordered the prizes as well as capt <\s>
<s> wickes to leave the port in twenty four hours <\s>
<s> the former were sent out but sold to french merchants and captain wickes his ship being leaky was permitted to stay <\s>
<s> soon after this captain johnson arrived in the lexington and we having bought a cutter with a view of sending her out as a packet altered our resolution and equipped her as a cruiser and sent her and the lexington out under the command of captain wickes as commodore with the design of intercepting the irish linen ships but by contrary winds and mistaking the time of the sailing of those ships they were unsuccessful as to the main object but as they sailed quite round ireland and took or destroyed seventeen or eighteen sail of vessels they most effectually alarmed england prevented the great fair at chester occasioned insurance to rise and even deterred the english merchants from shipping goods in english bottoms at any rate so that in a few weeks forty sail of french ships were loading in the thames on freight an instance never before known <\s>
<s> but upon this the english ambassador complained in a higher tone and gave us much difficulty the prizes however were disposed of though at a prodigious loss and captain wickes set about repairing and refitting the reprisal which had been obliged to throw over her guns and saw some of her beams to escape a seventy four gun ship which chased her and the lexington on their return from their cruise <\s>
<s> but before he was refitted orders were sent from court to detain his vessel and the lexington until further orders <\s>
<s> this was owing partly to captain wickes having repeatedly come into the ports of france with prizes and refitted his ship for fresh cruises it being directly contrary to the treaty which they pretend to hold sacred and partly to the transaction at dunkirk and the consequent threatenings of the british ministry <\s>
<s> in this situation captain wickes and captain johnson remain at present <\s>
<s> soon after mr hodge's arrival we bought a lugger at dover and sent her to dunkirk <\s>
<s> mr hodge went after her and equipped her with great secrecy designing a blow in the north sea <\s>
<s> he sent captain cunningham in her and ordered him to intercept the packet between england and holland and then to cruise northward towards the baltic <\s>
<s> cunningham fell in with the packet in a day or two after leaving dunkirk and took her <\s>
<s> as she had a prodigious number of letters on board he imagined it was proper he should return to dunkirk instead of continuing his course in his return he also took a brig of some value and brought both prizes into port <\s>
<s> this spread the alarm far and wide and gave much real ground of complaint as he had been entirely armed and equipped in dunkirk and had returned thither with his prizes <\s>
<s> the ministry therefore to appease england ordered the prizes to be returned and cunningham and his crew to be imprisoned which gave the english a temporary triumph <\s>
<s> but not discouraged thereby another cutter was bought and equipped completely in the port of dunkirk <\s>
<s> cunningham and his crew were set at liberty and with some address and intrigue he got again to sea from the same port in a swift sailing cutter mounting fourteen six pounders and twenty two swivels with one hundred and six men <\s>
<s> his first adventure greatly raised insurance on the northern trade even the packet boats from dover to calais were for some time insured <\s>
<s> on his leaving the port of dunkirk the second time he had orders to proceed directly for america but he and his crew full of resentment for the insults they had received from the enemy whilst in prison at dunkirk and afterwards attacked the first vessels they met with and plundered and burnt as they went on <\s>
<s> our last accounts are that they had taken or destroyed about twenty sail and had appeared off the town of lynn and threatened to burn it unless ransomed but the wind proving unfavorable they could not put their threats into execution <\s>
<s> in a word cunningham by his first and second bold expeditions is become the terror of all the eastern coast of england and scotland and is more dreaded than thurot was in the late war <\s>
<s> but though this distresses our enemies it embarrasses us <\s>
<s> we solicited his enlargement and mr hodge engaged for his going directly for america <\s>
<s> i know not how his engagement was expressed but to appease the british ministry and drive off an instant war mr hodge has been arrested and confined <\s>
<s> his friends need not be in distress for him he will soon be at liberty <\s>
<s> he merits much from his country having been ready at all times to promote and serve its interests <\s>
<s> just before the sailing of cunningham captain burrall arrived in a maryland pilot boat <\s>
<s> he made several prizes in his passage and brought one into cherbourg with him <\s>
<s> he came to paris for our advice but on his return suffered himself to be enticed on board an english cutter in the port where he was instantly seized and the cutter came to sail and carried him off prisoner <\s>

<s> the ship general mifflin after cruising some time on the coasts of england and ireland put into brest and there under continental colors saluted the admiral who after consulting his officers returned the salute which causes much speculation and shows that the officers as well as the other orders in this kingdom are much in our interest <\s>

<s> insurance rose in london and it was generally supposed that there would be a restitution of the prizes and detention of captain wickes or a declaration of war <\s>

<s> you know that when i left america the naval armaments were but beginning by the congress and the inquiry was hardly made even by individuals whether foreign powers would admit our cruisers and their prizes <\s>
<s> after my arrival the question was first started by captain lee of marblehead at bilboa of which i gave you an account in my letters of october and november last <\s>
<s> captain lee carried no prize into bilboa with him and the question turned simply on the complaint of the english consul charging him with having committed acts of piracy on the high seas in making prizes of english vessels <\s>
<s> the commissary or governor of the port detained his vessel and sent to court for directions and received orders to set the vessel at liberty which orders were accompanied with a general declaration that his catholic majesty was neuter in the dispute between england and america <\s>
<s> though the issue of this business was favorable it was not direct to the point we wished to establish the declaration of neutrality to be general <\s>
<s> in my letters of october and november last some of which must have been received i repeatedly gave my sentiments in favor of sending cruisers into these seas <\s>
<s> the first that arrived was the reprisal with two prizes this caused much speculation and at our first audience after we were told that by the treaties subsisting between france and england ships of war belonging to any foreign power at war with either could not be admitted into their ports unless driven by stress of weather or want of provisions c <\s>
<s> and that in such case they could not be permitted to stay longer than twenty four hours or until they had taken on board the provisions necessary to carry them to the nearest port of their respective states c <\s>
<s> as you will see in the treaty of commerce of 1713 confirmed by all the subsequent treaties <\s>
<s> at the same time we were given to understand that every favor and indulgence compatible with the treaties would be shewn us and that ways might be found out to dispose of those prizes without giving public offence to england <\s>
<s> the hint was taken the prizes disposed of and the reprisal repaired and fitted for another cruise which she made on the coast of spain taking among other english prizes the packet boat from lisbon with which captain wickes returned to port l'orient <\s>
<s> on this the english ambassador complained loudly and the english merchants were alarmed <\s>
<s> insurance rose in london and it was generally supposed that there would be a restitution of the prizes and detention of captain wickes or a declaration of war <\s>
<s> this court then ordered the prizes as well as capt <\s>
<s> wickes to leave the port in twenty four hours <\s>
<s> the former were sent out but sold to french merchants and captain wickes his ship being leaky was permitted to stay <\s>
<s> soon after this captain johnson arrived in the lexington and we having bought a cutter with a view of sending her out as a packet altered our resolution and equipped her as a cruiser and sent her and the lexington out under the command of captain wickes as commodore with the design of intercepting the irish linen ships but by contrary winds and mistaking the time of the sailing of those ships they were unsuccessful as to the main object but as they sailed quite round ireland and took or destroyed seventeen or eighteen sail of vessels they most effectually alarmed england prevented the great fair at chester occasioned insurance to rise and even deterred the english merchants from shipping goods in english bottoms at any rate so that in a few weeks forty sail of french ships were loading in the thames on freight an instance never before known <\s>
<s> but upon this the english ambassador complained in a higher tone and gave us much difficulty the prizes however were disposed of though at a prodigious loss and captain wickes set about repairing and refitting the reprisal which had been obliged to throw over her guns and saw some of her beams to escape a seventy four gun ship which chased her and the lexington on their return from their cruise <\s>
<s> but before he was refitted orders were sent from court to detain his vessel and the lexington until further orders <\s>
<s> this was owing partly to captain wickes having repeatedly come into the ports of france with prizes and refitted his ship for fresh cruises it being directly contrary to the treaty which they pretend to hold sacred and partly to the transaction at dunkirk and the consequent threatenings of the british ministry <\s>
<s> in this situation captain wickes and captain johnson remain at present <\s>
<s> soon after mr hodge's arrival we bought a lugger at dover and sent her to dunkirk <\s>
<s> mr hodge went after her and equipped her with great secrecy designing a blow in the north sea <\s>
<s> he sent captain cunningham in her and ordered him to intercept the packet between england and holland and then to cruise northward towards the baltic <\s>
<s> cunningham fell in with the packet in a day or two after leaving dunkirk and took her <\s>
<s> as she had a prodigious number of letters on board he imagined it was proper he should return to dunkirk instead of continuing his course in his return he also took a brig of some value and brought both prizes into port <\s>
<s> this spread the alarm far and wide and gave much real ground of complaint as he had been entirely armed and equipped in dunkirk and had returned thither with his prizes <\s>
<s> the ministry therefore to appease england ordered the prizes to be returned and cunningham and his crew to be imprisoned which gave the english a temporary triumph <\s>
<s> but not discouraged thereby another cutter was bought and equipped completely in the port of dunkirk <\s>
<s> cunningham and his crew were set at liberty and with some address and intrigue he got again to sea from the same port in a swift sailing cutter mounting fourteen six pounders and twenty two swivels with one hundred and six men <\s>
<s> his first adventure greatly raised insurance on the northern trade even the packet boats from dover to calais were for some time insured <\s>
<s> on his leaving the port of dunkirk the second time he had orders to proceed directly for america but he and his crew full of resentment for the insults they had received from the enemy whilst in prison at dunkirk and afterwards attacked the first vessels they met with and plundered and burnt as they went on <\s>
<s> our last accounts are that they had taken or destroyed about twenty sail and had appeared off the town of lynn and threatened to burn it unless ransomed but the wind proving unfavorable they could not put their threats into execution <\s>

<s> you know that when i left america the naval armaments were but beginning by the congress and the inquiry was hardly made even by individuals whether foreign powers would admit our cruisers and their prizes <\s>
<s> after my arrival the question was first started by captain lee of marblehead at bilboa of which i gave you an account in my letters of october and november last <\s>
<s> captain lee carried no prize into bilboa with him and the question turned simply on the complaint of the english consul charging him with having committed acts of piracy on the high seas in making prizes of english vessels <\s>
<s> the commissary or governor of the port detained his vessel and sent to court for directions and received orders to set the vessel at liberty which orders were accompanied with a general declaration that his catholic majesty was neuter in the dispute between england and america <\s>
<s> though the issue of this business was favorable it was not direct to the point we wished to establish the declaration of neutrality to be general <\s>
<s> in my letters of october and november last some of which must have been received i repeatedly gave my sentiments in favor of sending cruisers into these seas <\s>
<s> the first that arrived was the reprisal with two prizes this caused much speculation and at our first audience after we were told that by the treaties subsisting between france and england ships of war belonging to any foreign power at war with either could not be admitted into their ports unless driven by stress of weather or want of provisions c <\s>
<s> and that in such case they could not be permitted to stay longer than twenty four hours or until they had taken on board the provisions necessary to carry them to the nearest port of their respective states c <\s>
<s> as you will see in the treaty of commerce of 1713 confirmed by all the subsequent treaties <\s>
<s> at the same time we were given to understand that every favor and indulgence compatible with the treaties would be shewn us and that ways might be found out to dispose of those prizes without giving public offence to england <\s>
<s> the hint was taken the prizes disposed of and the reprisal repaired and fitted for another cruise which she made on the coast of spain taking among other english prizes the packet boat from lisbon with which captain wickes returned to port l'orient <\s>
<s> on this the english ambassador complained loudly and the english merchants were alarmed <\s>
<s> insurance rose in london and it was generally supposed that there would be a restitution of the prizes and detention of captain wickes or a declaration of war <\s>
<s> this court then ordered the prizes as well as capt <\s>
<s> wickes to leave the port in twenty four hours <\s>
<s> the former were sent out but sold to french merchants and captain wickes his ship being leaky was permitted to stay <\s>
<s> soon after this captain johnson arrived in the lexington and we having bought a cutter with a view of sending her out as a packet altered our resolution and equipped her as a cruiser and sent her and the lexington out under the command of captain wickes as commodore with the design of intercepting the irish linen ships but by contrary winds and mistaking the time of the sailing of those ships they were unsuccessful as to the main object but as they sailed quite round ireland and took or destroyed seventeen or eighteen sail of vessels they most effectually alarmed england prevented the great fair at chester occasioned insurance to rise and even deterred the english merchants from shipping goods in english bottoms at any rate so that in a few weeks forty sail of french ships were loading in the thames on freight an instance never before known <\s>
<s> but upon this the english ambassador complained in a higher tone and gave us much difficulty the prizes however were disposed of though at a prodigious loss and captain wickes set about repairing and refitting the reprisal which had been obliged to throw over her guns and saw some of her beams to escape a seventy four gun ship which chased her and the lexington on their return from their cruise <\s>
<s> but before he was refitted orders were sent from court to detain his vessel and the lexington until further orders <\s>
<s> this was owing partly to captain wickes having repeatedly come into the ports of france with prizes and refitted his ship for fresh cruises it being directly contrary to the treaty which they pretend to hold sacred and partly to the transaction at dunkirk and the consequent threatenings of the british ministry <\s>
<s> in this situation captain wickes and captain johnson remain at present <\s>
<s> soon after mr hodge's arrival we bought a lugger at dover and sent her to dunkirk <\s>
<s> mr hodge went after her and equipped her with great secrecy designing a blow in the north sea <\s>
<s> he sent captain cunningham in her and ordered him to intercept the packet between england and holland and then to cruise northward towards the baltic <\s>
<s> cunningham fell in with the packet in a day or two after leaving dunkirk and took her <\s>
<s> as she had a prodigious number of letters on board he imagined it was proper he should return to dunkirk instead of continuing his course in his return he also took a brig of some value and brought both prizes into port <\s>
<s> this spread the alarm far and wide and gave much real ground of complaint as he had been entirely armed and equipped in dunkirk and had returned thither with his prizes <\s>
<s> the ministry therefore to appease england ordered the prizes to be returned and cunningham and his crew to be imprisoned which gave the english a temporary triumph <\s>
<s> but not discouraged thereby another cutter was bought and equipped completely in the port of dunkirk <\s>
<s> cunningham and his crew were set at liberty and with some address and intrigue he got again to sea from the same port in a swift sailing cutter mounting fourteen six pounders and twenty two swivels with one hundred and six men <\s>
<s> his first adventure greatly raised insurance on the northern trade even the packet boats from dover to calais were for some time insured <\s>
<s> on his leaving the port of dunkirk the second time he had orders to proceed directly for america but he and his crew full of resentment for the insults they had received from the enemy whilst in prison at dunkirk and afterwards attacked the first vessels they met with and plundered and burnt as they went on <\s>
<s> our last accounts are that they had taken or destroyed about twenty sail and had appeared off the town of lynn and threatened to burn it unless ransomed but the wind proving unfavorable they could not put their threats into execution <\s>
<s> in a word cunningham by his first and second bold expeditions is become the terror of all the eastern coast of england and scotland and is more dreaded than thurot was in the late war <\s>
<s> but though this distresses our enemies it embarrasses us <\s>
<s> we solicited his enlargement and mr hodge engaged for his going directly for america <\s>
<s> i know not how his engagement was expressed but to appease the british ministry and drive off an instant war mr hodge has been arrested and confined <\s>

<s> the ship general mifflin after cruising some time on the coasts of england and ireland put into brest and there under continental colors saluted the admiral who after consulting his officers returned the salute which causes much speculation and shows that the officers as well as the other orders in this kingdom are much in our interest <\s>

<s> on his arrival at painbeuf she wrote to her brother a merchant at nantes who came down and hoping to get the consignment of the prizes officiously advised the captain to report them as ships laden at st eustatia which they did and on their arrival at nantes consigned the prizes to messrs lee williams who immediately made a private sale of them <\s>
<s> meantime the owners being acquainted with the proceeding and knowing that the ships and cargoes by being regularly entered were in the hands of the custom house lodged claims showing that they had been falsely entered and were english property captured by american privateers and consequently by treaty could not be sold in france <\s>

<s> in this i mean to give you a short view of the conduct of this court with respect to american ships of war private as well as public which i cannot well do without giving you a history of facts <\s>
<s> you know that when i left america the naval armaments were but beginning by the congress and the inquiry was hardly made even by individuals whether foreign powers would admit our cruisers and their prizes <\s>
<s> after my arrival the question was first started by captain lee of marblehead at bilboa of which i gave you an account in my letters of october and november last <\s>
<s> captain lee carried no prize into bilboa with him and the question turned simply on the complaint of the english consul charging him with having committed acts of piracy on the high seas in making prizes of english vessels <\s>
<s> the commissary or governor of the port detained his vessel and sent to court for directions and received orders to set the vessel at liberty which orders were accompanied with a general declaration that his catholic majesty was neuter in the dispute between england and america <\s>
<s> though the issue of this business was favorable it was not direct to the point we wished to establish the declaration of neutrality to be general <\s>
<s> in my letters of october and november last some of which must have been received i repeatedly gave my sentiments in favor of sending cruisers into these seas <\s>
<s> the first that arrived was the reprisal with two prizes this caused much speculation and at our first audience after we were told that by the treaties subsisting between france and england ships of war belonging to any foreign power at war with either could not be admitted into their ports unless driven by stress of weather or want of provisions c <\s>
<s> and that in such case they could not be permitted to stay longer than twenty four hours or until they had taken on board the provisions necessary to carry them to the nearest port of their respective states c <\s>
<s> as you will see in the treaty of commerce of 1713 confirmed by all the subsequent treaties <\s>
<s> at the same time we were given to understand that every favor and indulgence compatible with the treaties would be shewn us and that ways might be found out to dispose of those prizes without giving public offence to england <\s>
<s> the hint was taken the prizes disposed of and the reprisal repaired and fitted for another cruise which she made on the coast of spain taking among other english prizes the packet boat from lisbon with which captain wickes returned to port l'orient <\s>
<s> on this the english ambassador complained loudly and the english merchants were alarmed <\s>
<s> insurance rose in london and it was generally supposed that there would be a restitution of the prizes and detention of captain wickes or a declaration of war <\s>
<s> this court then ordered the prizes as well as capt <\s>
<s> wickes to leave the port in twenty four hours <\s>
<s> the former were sent out but sold to french merchants and captain wickes his ship being leaky was permitted to stay <\s>
<s> soon after this captain johnson arrived in the lexington and we having bought a cutter with a view of sending her out as a packet altered our resolution and equipped her as a cruiser and sent her and the lexington out under the command of captain wickes as commodore with the design of intercepting the irish linen ships but by contrary winds and mistaking the time of the sailing of those ships they were unsuccessful as to the main object but as they sailed quite round ireland and took or destroyed seventeen or eighteen sail of vessels they most effectually alarmed england prevented the great fair at chester occasioned insurance to rise and even deterred the english merchants from shipping goods in english bottoms at any rate so that in a few weeks forty sail of french ships were loading in the thames on freight an instance never before known <\s>
<s> but upon this the english ambassador complained in a higher tone and gave us much difficulty the prizes however were disposed of though at a prodigious loss and captain wickes set about repairing and refitting the reprisal which had been obliged to throw over her guns and saw some of her beams to escape a seventy four gun ship which chased her and the lexington on their return from their cruise <\s>
<s> but before he was refitted orders were sent from court to detain his vessel and the lexington until further orders <\s>
<s> this was owing partly to captain wickes having repeatedly come into the ports of france with prizes and refitted his ship for fresh cruises it being directly contrary to the treaty which they pretend to hold sacred and partly to the transaction at dunkirk and the consequent threatenings of the british ministry <\s>

<s> you know that when i left america the naval armaments were but beginning by the congress and the inquiry was hardly made even by individuals whether foreign powers would admit our cruisers and their prizes <\s>
<s> after my arrival the question was first started by captain lee of marblehead at bilboa of which i gave you an account in my letters of october and november last <\s>
<s> captain lee carried no prize into bilboa with him and the question turned simply on the complaint of the english consul charging him with having committed acts of piracy on the high seas in making prizes of english vessels <\s>
<s> the commissary or governor of the port detained his vessel and sent to court for directions and received orders to set the vessel at liberty which orders were accompanied with a general declaration that his catholic majesty was neuter in the dispute between england and america <\s>
<s> though the issue of this business was favorable it was not direct to the point we wished to establish the declaration of neutrality to be general <\s>
<s> in my letters of october and november last some of which must have been received i repeatedly gave my sentiments in favor of sending cruisers into these seas <\s>
<s> the first that arrived was the reprisal with two prizes this caused much speculation and at our first audience after we were told that by the treaties subsisting between france and england ships of war belonging to any foreign power at war with either could not be admitted into their ports unless driven by stress of weather or want of provisions c <\s>
<s> and that in such case they could not be permitted to stay longer than twenty four hours or until they had taken on board the provisions necessary to carry them to the nearest port of their respective states c <\s>
<s> as you will see in the treaty of commerce of 1713 confirmed by all the subsequent treaties <\s>
<s> at the same time we were given to understand that every favor and indulgence compatible with the treaties would be shewn us and that ways might be found out to dispose of those prizes without giving public offence to england <\s>
<s> the hint was taken the prizes disposed of and the reprisal repaired and fitted for another cruise which she made on the coast of spain taking among other english prizes the packet boat from lisbon with which captain wickes returned to port l'orient <\s>
<s> on this the english ambassador complained loudly and the english merchants were alarmed <\s>
<s> insurance rose in london and it was generally supposed that there would be a restitution of the prizes and detention of captain wickes or a declaration of war <\s>
<s> this court then ordered the prizes as well as capt <\s>
<s> wickes to leave the port in twenty four hours <\s>
<s> the former were sent out but sold to french merchants and captain wickes his ship being leaky was permitted to stay <\s>
<s> soon after this captain johnson arrived in the lexington and we having bought a cutter with a view of sending her out as a packet altered our resolution and equipped her as a cruiser and sent her and the lexington out under the command of captain wickes as commodore with the design of intercepting the irish linen ships but by contrary winds and mistaking the time of the sailing of those ships they were unsuccessful as to the main object but as they sailed quite round ireland and took or destroyed seventeen or eighteen sail of vessels they most effectually alarmed england prevented the great fair at chester occasioned insurance to rise and even deterred the english merchants from shipping goods in english bottoms at any rate so that in a few weeks forty sail of french ships were loading in the thames on freight an instance never before known <\s>
<s> but upon this the english ambassador complained in a higher tone and gave us much difficulty the prizes however were disposed of though at a prodigious loss and captain wickes set about repairing and refitting the reprisal which had been obliged to throw over her guns and saw some of her beams to escape a seventy four gun ship which chased her and the lexington on their return from their cruise <\s>
<s> but before he was refitted orders were sent from court to detain his vessel and the lexington until further orders <\s>
<s> this was owing partly to captain wickes having repeatedly come into the ports of france with prizes and refitted his ship for fresh cruises it being directly contrary to the treaty which they pretend to hold sacred and partly to the transaction at dunkirk and the consequent threatenings of the british ministry <\s>
<s> in this situation captain wickes and captain johnson remain at present <\s>
<s> soon after mr hodge's arrival we bought a lugger at dover and sent her to dunkirk <\s>
<s> mr hodge went after her and equipped her with great secrecy designing a blow in the north sea <\s>
<s> he sent captain cunningham in her and ordered him to intercept the packet between england and holland and then to cruise northward towards the baltic <\s>
<s> cunningham fell in with the packet in a day or two after leaving dunkirk and took her <\s>
<s> as she had a prodigious number of letters on board he imagined it was proper he should return to dunkirk instead of continuing his course in his return he also took a brig of some value and brought both prizes into port <\s>
<s> this spread the alarm far and wide and gave much real ground of complaint as he had been entirely armed and equipped in dunkirk and had returned thither with his prizes <\s>
<s> the ministry therefore to appease england ordered the prizes to be returned and cunningham and his crew to be imprisoned which gave the english a temporary triumph <\s>
<s> but not discouraged thereby another cutter was bought and equipped completely in the port of dunkirk <\s>
<s> cunningham and his crew were set at liberty and with some address and intrigue he got again to sea from the same port in a swift sailing cutter mounting fourteen six pounders and twenty two swivels with one hundred and six men <\s>
<s> his first adventure greatly raised insurance on the northern trade even the packet boats from dover to calais were for some time insured <\s>
<s> on his leaving the port of dunkirk the second time he had orders to proceed directly for america but he and his crew full of resentment for the insults they had received from the enemy whilst in prison at dunkirk and afterwards attacked the first vessels they met with and plundered and burnt as they went on <\s>
<s> our last accounts are that they had taken or destroyed about twenty sail and had appeared off the town of lynn and threatened to burn it unless ransomed but the wind proving unfavorable they could not put their threats into execution <\s>
<s> in a word cunningham by his first and second bold expeditions is become the terror of all the eastern coast of england and scotland and is more dreaded than thurot was in the late war <\s>
<s> but though this distresses our enemies it embarrasses us <\s>
<s> we solicited his enlargement and mr hodge engaged for his going directly for america <\s>
<s> i know not how his engagement was expressed but to appease the british ministry and drive off an instant war mr hodge has been arrested and confined <\s>
<s> his friends need not be in distress for him he will soon be at liberty <\s>

<s> you know that when i left america the naval armaments were but beginning by the congress and the inquiry was hardly made even by individuals whether foreign powers would admit our cruisers and their prizes <\s>
<s> after my arrival the question was first started by captain lee of marblehead at bilboa of which i gave you an account in my letters of october and november last <\s>
<s> captain lee carried no prize into bilboa with him and the question turned simply on the complaint of the english consul charging him with having committed acts of piracy on the high seas in making prizes of english vessels <\s>
<s> the commissary or governor of the port detained his vessel and sent to court for directions and received orders to set the vessel at liberty which orders were accompanied with a general declaration that his catholic majesty was neuter in the dispute between england and america <\s>
<s> though the issue of this business was favorable it was not direct to the point we wished to establish the declaration of neutrality to be general <\s>
<s> in my letters of october and november last some of which must have been received i repeatedly gave my sentiments in favor of sending cruisers into these seas <\s>
<s> the first that arrived was the reprisal with two prizes this caused much speculation and at our first audience after we were told that by the treaties subsisting between france and england ships of war belonging to any foreign power at war with either could not be admitted into their ports unless driven by stress of weather or want of provisions c <\s>
<s> and that in such case they could not be permitted to stay longer than twenty four hours or until they had taken on board the provisions necessary to carry them to the nearest port of their respective states c <\s>
<s> as you will see in the treaty of commerce of 1713 confirmed by all the subsequent treaties <\s>
<s> at the same time we were given to understand that every favor and indulgence compatible with the treaties would be shewn us and that ways might be found out to dispose of those prizes without giving public offence to england <\s>
<s> the hint was taken the prizes disposed of and the reprisal repaired and fitted for another cruise which she made on the coast of spain taking among other english prizes the packet boat from lisbon with which captain wickes returned to port l'orient <\s>
<s> on this the english ambassador complained loudly and the english merchants were alarmed <\s>
<s> insurance rose in london and it was generally supposed that there would be a restitution of the prizes and detention of captain wickes or a declaration of war <\s>
<s> this court then ordered the prizes as well as capt <\s>
<s> wickes to leave the port in twenty four hours <\s>
<s> the former were sent out but sold to french merchants and captain wickes his ship being leaky was permitted to stay <\s>
<s> soon after this captain johnson arrived in the lexington and we having bought a cutter with a view of sending her out as a packet altered our resolution and equipped her as a cruiser and sent her and the lexington out under the command of captain wickes as commodore with the design of intercepting the irish linen ships but by contrary winds and mistaking the time of the sailing of those ships they were unsuccessful as to the main object but as they sailed quite round ireland and took or destroyed seventeen or eighteen sail of vessels they most effectually alarmed england prevented the great fair at chester occasioned insurance to rise and even deterred the english merchants from shipping goods in english bottoms at any rate so that in a few weeks forty sail of french ships were loading in the thames on freight an instance never before known <\s>
<s> but upon this the english ambassador complained in a higher tone and gave us much difficulty the prizes however were disposed of though at a prodigious loss and captain wickes set about repairing and refitting the reprisal which had been obliged to throw over her guns and saw some of her beams to escape a seventy four gun ship which chased her and the lexington on their return from their cruise <\s>
<s> but before he was refitted orders were sent from court to detain his vessel and the lexington until further orders <\s>
<s> this was owing partly to captain wickes having repeatedly come into the ports of france with prizes and refitted his ship for fresh cruises it being directly contrary to the treaty which they pretend to hold sacred and partly to the transaction at dunkirk and the consequent threatenings of the british ministry <\s>
<s> in this situation captain wickes and captain johnson remain at present <\s>
<s> soon after mr hodge's arrival we bought a lugger at dover and sent her to dunkirk <\s>
<s> mr hodge went after her and equipped her with great secrecy designing a blow in the north sea <\s>
<s> he sent captain cunningham in her and ordered him to intercept the packet between england and holland and then to cruise northward towards the baltic <\s>
<s> cunningham fell in with the packet in a day or two after leaving dunkirk and took her <\s>
<s> as she had a prodigious number of letters on board he imagined it was proper he should return to dunkirk instead of continuing his course in his return he also took a brig of some value and brought both prizes into port <\s>
<s> this spread the alarm far and wide and gave much real ground of complaint as he had been entirely armed and equipped in dunkirk and had returned thither with his prizes <\s>
<s> the ministry therefore to appease england ordered the prizes to be returned and cunningham and his crew to be imprisoned which gave the english a temporary triumph <\s>
<s> but not discouraged thereby another cutter was bought and equipped completely in the port of dunkirk <\s>
<s> cunningham and his crew were set at liberty and with some address and intrigue he got again to sea from the same port in a swift sailing cutter mounting fourteen six pounders and twenty two swivels with one hundred and six men <\s>
<s> his first adventure greatly raised insurance on the northern trade even the packet boats from dover to calais were for some time insured <\s>
<s> on his leaving the port of dunkirk the second time he had orders to proceed directly for america but he and his crew full of resentment for the insults they had received from the enemy whilst in prison at dunkirk and afterwards attacked the first vessels they met with and plundered and burnt as they went on <\s>
<s> our last accounts are that they had taken or destroyed about twenty sail and had appeared off the town of lynn and threatened to burn it unless ransomed but the wind proving unfavorable they could not put their threats into execution <\s>
<s> in a word cunningham by his first and second bold expeditions is become the terror of all the eastern coast of england and scotland and is more dreaded than thurot was in the late war <\s>
<s> but though this distresses our enemies it embarrasses us <\s>
<s> we solicited his enlargement and mr hodge engaged for his going directly for america <\s>
<s> i know not how his engagement was expressed but to appease the british ministry and drive off an instant war mr hodge has been arrested and confined <\s>
<s> his friends need not be in distress for him he will soon be at liberty <\s>
<s> he merits much from his country having been ready at all times to promote and serve its interests <\s>
<s> just before the sailing of cunningham captain burrall arrived in a maryland pilot boat <\s>
<s> he made several prizes in his passage and brought one into cherbourg with him <\s>
<s> he came to paris for our advice but on his return suffered himself to be enticed on board an english cutter in the port where he was instantly seized and the cutter came to sail and carried him off prisoner <\s>
<s> we complained and were promised that he should be reclaimed by this court it has probably been done but we have received no answer <\s>
<s> the ship general mifflin after cruising some time on the coasts of england and ireland put into brest and there under continental colors saluted the admiral who after consulting his officers returned the salute which causes much speculation and shows that the officers as well as the other orders in this kingdom are much in our interest <\s>

<s> captain lee carried no prize into bilboa with him and the question turned simply on the complaint of the english consul charging him with having committed acts of piracy on the high seas in making prizes of english vessels <\s>
<s> the commissary or governor of the port detained his vessel and sent to court for directions and received orders to set the vessel at liberty which orders were accompanied with a general declaration that his catholic majesty was neuter in the dispute between england and america <\s>
<s> though the issue of this business was favorable it was not direct to the point we wished to establish the declaration of neutrality to be general <\s>
<s> in my letters of october and november last some of which must have been received i repeatedly gave my sentiments in favor of sending cruisers into these seas <\s>
<s> the first that arrived was the reprisal with two prizes this caused much speculation and at our first audience after we were told that by the treaties subsisting between france and england ships of war belonging to any foreign power at war with either could not be admitted into their ports unless driven by stress of weather or want of provisions c <\s>
<s> and that in such case they could not be permitted to stay longer than twenty four hours or until they had taken on board the provisions necessary to carry them to the nearest port of their respective states c <\s>
<s> as you will see in the treaty of commerce of 1713 confirmed by all the subsequent treaties <\s>
<s> at the same time we were given to understand that every favor and indulgence compatible with the treaties would be shewn us and that ways might be found out to dispose of those prizes without giving public offence to england <\s>
<s> the hint was taken the prizes disposed of and the reprisal repaired and fitted for another cruise which she made on the coast of spain taking among other english prizes the packet boat from lisbon with which captain wickes returned to port l'orient <\s>
<s> on this the english ambassador complained loudly and the english merchants were alarmed <\s>
<s> insurance rose in london and it was generally supposed that there would be a restitution of the prizes and detention of captain wickes or a declaration of war <\s>
<s> this court then ordered the prizes as well as capt <\s>
<s> wickes to leave the port in twenty four hours <\s>
<s> the former were sent out but sold to french merchants and captain wickes his ship being leaky was permitted to stay <\s>
<s> soon after this captain johnson arrived in the lexington and we having bought a cutter with a view of sending her out as a packet altered our resolution and equipped her as a cruiser and sent her and the lexington out under the command of captain wickes as commodore with the design of intercepting the irish linen ships but by contrary winds and mistaking the time of the sailing of those ships they were unsuccessful as to the main object but as they sailed quite round ireland and took or destroyed seventeen or eighteen sail of vessels they most effectually alarmed england prevented the great fair at chester occasioned insurance to rise and even deterred the english merchants from shipping goods in english bottoms at any rate so that in a few weeks forty sail of french ships were loading in the thames on freight an instance never before known <\s>
<s> but upon this the english ambassador complained in a higher tone and gave us much difficulty the prizes however were disposed of though at a prodigious loss and captain wickes set about repairing and refitting the reprisal which had been obliged to throw over her guns and saw some of her beams to escape a seventy four gun ship which chased her and the lexington on their return from their cruise <\s>
<s> but before he was refitted orders were sent from court to detain his vessel and the lexington until further orders <\s>
<s> this was owing partly to captain wickes having repeatedly come into the ports of france with prizes and refitted his ship for fresh cruises it being directly contrary to the treaty which they pretend to hold sacred and partly to the transaction at dunkirk and the consequent threatenings of the british ministry <\s>
<s> in this situation captain wickes and captain johnson remain at present <\s>
<s> soon after mr hodge's arrival we bought a lugger at dover and sent her to dunkirk <\s>
<s> mr hodge went after her and equipped her with great secrecy designing a blow in the north sea <\s>
<s> he sent captain cunningham in her and ordered him to intercept the packet between england and holland and then to cruise northward towards the baltic <\s>
<s> cunningham fell in with the packet in a day or two after leaving dunkirk and took her <\s>
<s> as she had a prodigious number of letters on board he imagined it was proper he should return to dunkirk instead of continuing his course in his return he also took a brig of some value and brought both prizes into port <\s>
<s> this spread the alarm far and wide and gave much real ground of complaint as he had been entirely armed and equipped in dunkirk and had returned thither with his prizes <\s>
<s> the ministry therefore to appease england ordered the prizes to be returned and cunningham and his crew to be imprisoned which gave the english a temporary triumph <\s>
<s> but not discouraged thereby another cutter was bought and equipped completely in the port of dunkirk <\s>
<s> cunningham and his crew were set at liberty and with some address and intrigue he got again to sea from the same port in a swift sailing cutter mounting fourteen six pounders and twenty two swivels with one hundred and six men <\s>
<s> his first adventure greatly raised insurance on the northern trade even the packet boats from dover to calais were for some time insured <\s>
<s> on his leaving the port of dunkirk the second time he had orders to proceed directly for america but he and his crew full of resentment for the insults they had received from the enemy whilst in prison at dunkirk and afterwards attacked the first vessels they met with and plundered and burnt as they went on <\s>
<s> our last accounts are that they had taken or destroyed about twenty sail and had appeared off the town of lynn and threatened to burn it unless ransomed but the wind proving unfavorable they could not put their threats into execution <\s>
<s> in a word cunningham by his first and second bold expeditions is become the terror of all the eastern coast of england and scotland and is more dreaded than thurot was in the late war <\s>
<s> but though this distresses our enemies it embarrasses us <\s>
<s> we solicited his enlargement and mr hodge engaged for his going directly for america <\s>
<s> i know not how his engagement was expressed but to appease the british ministry and drive off an instant war mr hodge has been arrested and confined <\s>
<s> his friends need not be in distress for him he will soon be at liberty <\s>
<s> he merits much from his country having been ready at all times to promote and serve its interests <\s>
<s> just before the sailing of cunningham captain burrall arrived in a maryland pilot boat <\s>
<s> he made several prizes in his passage and brought one into cherbourg with him <\s>
<s> he came to paris for our advice but on his return suffered himself to be enticed on board an english cutter in the port where he was instantly seized and the cutter came to sail and carried him off prisoner <\s>
<s> we complained and were promised that he should be reclaimed by this court it has probably been done but we have received no answer <\s>
<s> the ship general mifflin after cruising some time on the coasts of england and ireland put into brest and there under continental colors saluted the admiral who after consulting his officers returned the salute which causes much speculation and shows that the officers as well as the other orders in this kingdom are much in our interest <\s>
<s> but the politics of this court are intricate and embarrassed with connexions and alliances on the continent of europe which with the state of their fleet and their sailors being abroad in the fishery c <\s>
<s> puts off bold and decisive measures <\s>

<s> the prizes are sold without condemnation and consequently to a great loss as the whole is conducted secretly and put too much in the power of the agents <\s>

<s> i will not add to this as i shall write another letter by this conveyance <\s>
<s> i beg my best compliments to mrs morris and that you will believe me ever dear sir yours c <\s>
<s> s since writing the above the two jamaica prizes are by order of court arrested and it remains doubtful whether they will not be restored to the original proprietors <\s>
<s> the captain of one of the privateers on his passage took on board a lady who was prisoner on board an american privateer bound for boston <\s>
<s> this he did from motives of humanity <\s>
<s> on his arrival at painbeuf she wrote to her brother a merchant at nantes who came down and hoping to get the consignment of the prizes officiously advised the captain to report them as ships laden at st eustatia which they did and on their arrival at nantes consigned the prizes to messrs lee williams who immediately made a private sale of them <\s>
<s> meantime the owners being acquainted with the proceeding and knowing that the ships and cargoes by being regularly entered were in the hands of the custom house lodged claims showing that they had been falsely entered and were english property captured by american privateers and consequently by treaty could not be sold in france <\s>
<s> this obliged the government to arrest the prizes or openly violate the treaty <\s>
<s> mr williams came up a few days since and presented a memorial on the subject but i fear he will receive an unfavorable answer <\s>
<s> orders are received for captains wickes and johnson to depart the ports of france <\s>
<s> i purpose sending duplicates of this letter by each of them <\s>
<s> i cannot omit any opportunity of doing justice to these gentlemen their officers and seamen whose conduct has been such as merits the approbation of their countrymen and has given reputation to our navy in france <\s>
<s> they will not be able to carry out any goods though we had purchased some with a design of sending by them particularly a quantity of saltpetre <\s>
<s> this with other articles to a considerable amount will be sent in the course of this and the next month <\s>

<s> his desertion of this charge with his other conduct makes me wish he may not arrive in america at all <\s>

<s> with respect to the other stores they are embarked and i am promised a permit which is all i may say on the subject which is left solely to my management by my colleagues <\s>
<s> du coudray not content with leaving the ship took with him the papers which occasioned a still further delay after she was ready but i will not enlarge on these disagreeable topics but wishing the stores at hand i am with much esteem c <\s>

<s> he leaves a major's post here in the army of france hoping by his services in america to advance himself beyond what he can expect in europe in a time of peace <\s>
<s> i shall as soon as possible send you a particular account of all my proceedings to the time of the arrival of dr franklin which i have in a great measure done already though in detached parts in different letters some of which may undoubtedly miscarry <\s>

<s> gentlemen this will be delivered you by captain goy who with his lieutenant and two sergeants embarks with thirty field pieces ten ton of powder ball lead c <\s>
<s> which i wish safe and in season for service though delayed beyond my expectations <\s>
<s> captain goy has the best of recommendations from officers of distinction here and i am confident will be found to be of great service in the artillery a part of which he accompanies <\s>
<s> dr franklin is at present in the country in good health and we shall jointly write you very particularly in a few days meantime we are without any intelligence from congress since he left philadelphia in october last <\s>
<s> i will not attempt to give you an idea of the difficulties which are the consequence of our being left thus without intelligence nor the anxiety it occasions in our minds but must urge you to take some effectual measures for keeping up a correspondence with us in future without which many proposals of the utmost importance to the united states are extremely embarrassed and in danger of failing <\s>

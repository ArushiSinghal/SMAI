<s> mr lee informs you we suppose of his negotiations in prussia and his safe return hither <\s>
<s> there appears in that as well as in every other country in europe a disposition to share in our commerce and to oblige us as far as may be done without offending england <\s>
<s> we have numbers of letters from eminent houses there proposing to furnish us with a variety of commodities at reasonable rates to be received by us in europe and paid for here <\s>
<s> we advise them to send their goods in their own ships and protect their own trade to and from our coasts <\s>
<s> we enclose you a copy of the memorial 40 we sent to portugal to which we have yet received no answer <\s>
<s> that court has been lately much employed in adjusting its differences with spain which it is said are now nearly all accommodated and that they will accede to the family compact <\s>
<s> this court continues the same conduct that it has held ever since our arrival <\s>
<s> it professes to england a resolution to observe all treaties and proves it by restoring prizes too openly brought into their ports imprisoning such persons as are found to be concerned in fitting out armed vessels against england from france warning frequently those from america to depart and repeating orders against the exportation of warlike stores <\s>
<s> to us it privately professes a real friendship wishes success to our cause winks at the supplies we obtain here as much as it can without giving open grounds of complaint to england privately affords us very essential aids and goes on preparing for war <\s>
<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>
<s> in the mean time perhaps the delay may have this good effect for us that enjoying the whole harvest of plunder upon the british commerce which otherwise france and spain would divide with us our infant naval power finds such plentiful nourishment as has increased and must increase its growth and strength most marvellously <\s>
<s> it gave us great joy to hear of the arrival of the mercury amphitrite and other vessels carrying supplies <\s>
<s> another ship with a similar cargo which had long been detained at marseilles we hope will soon arrive with you <\s>
<s> we hope also that you will receive between twenty and thirty thousand suits of clothes before winter and from time to time quantities of new and good arms which we are purchasing in different parts of europe <\s>
<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>
<s> but if the present campaign should end favorably for us perhaps we may be able to accomplish it another year as some jealousy begins to be entertained of the english funds by the dutch and other monied people of europe to the increase of which jealousy we hope a paper 41 we have drawn up a copy whereof we enclose may in some degree contribute when made public <\s>

<s> as the english goods cannot in foreign markets face those of the french or dutch loaded as they are with the high insurance from which their competitors are exempted it is certain the trade of britain must diminish while she is at war with us and the rest of europe in peace <\s>
<s> to evade this mischief she now begins to make use of french bottoms but as we have yet no treaty with france or any other power that gives to free ships the privilege of making free goods we may weaken that project by taking the goods of the enemy wherever we find them paying the freight <\s>

<s> gentlemen since ours to you by return of the packet from new hampshire and duplicates by mr mccreary from maryland we have not written nor have we received any of your favors during the last two months except a letter of old date april 19th signed by messrs deane and lee <\s>
<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>
<s> should this be the case general howe's visit cannot be of long duration <\s>

<s> gentlemen it is long since we had a line from you the last received being of the date of we suppose from the same causes which have occasioned your hearing so seldom from us the difficulty of finding safe conveyances and sometimes the loss of the despatches by the way <\s>
<s> mr lee informs you we suppose of his negotiations in prussia and his safe return hither <\s>
<s> there appears in that as well as in every other country in europe a disposition to share in our commerce and to oblige us as far as may be done without offending england <\s>
<s> we have numbers of letters from eminent houses there proposing to furnish us with a variety of commodities at reasonable rates to be received by us in europe and paid for here <\s>
<s> we advise them to send their goods in their own ships and protect their own trade to and from our coasts <\s>
<s> we enclose you a copy of the memorial 40 we sent to portugal to which we have yet received no answer <\s>
<s> that court has been lately much employed in adjusting its differences with spain which it is said are now nearly all accommodated and that they will accede to the family compact <\s>
<s> this court continues the same conduct that it has held ever since our arrival <\s>
<s> it professes to england a resolution to observe all treaties and proves it by restoring prizes too openly brought into their ports imprisoning such persons as are found to be concerned in fitting out armed vessels against england from france warning frequently those from america to depart and repeating orders against the exportation of warlike stores <\s>
<s> to us it privately professes a real friendship wishes success to our cause winks at the supplies we obtain here as much as it can without giving open grounds of complaint to england privately affords us very essential aids and goes on preparing for war <\s>
<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>
<s> in the mean time perhaps the delay may have this good effect for us that enjoying the whole harvest of plunder upon the british commerce which otherwise france and spain would divide with us our infant naval power finds such plentiful nourishment as has increased and must increase its growth and strength most marvellously <\s>
<s> it gave us great joy to hear of the arrival of the mercury amphitrite and other vessels carrying supplies <\s>
<s> another ship with a similar cargo which had long been detained at marseilles we hope will soon arrive with you <\s>
<s> we hope also that you will receive between twenty and thirty thousand suits of clothes before winter and from time to time quantities of new and good arms which we are purchasing in different parts of europe <\s>
<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>
<s> but if the present campaign should end favorably for us perhaps we may be able to accomplish it another year as some jealousy begins to be entertained of the english funds by the dutch and other monied people of europe to the increase of which jealousy we hope a paper 41 we have drawn up a copy whereof we enclose may in some degree contribute when made public <\s>
<s> mr deane has written fully to you on the effect our cruisers have had on the coast and commerce of britain which makes our saying much on that head unnecessary 42 we cannot however omit this opportunity of expressing our satisfaction in the conduct of the captains and of recommending them warmly to congress <\s>
<s> the ostensible letter and answer from and to the minister of foreign affairs copies of which we enclose 43 will show the conduct which the court has thought and thinks itself at present obliged to hold with regard to our cruisers and their prizes of which it seems fit some notice should be given to the several states <\s>
<s> as the english goods cannot in foreign markets face those of the french or dutch loaded as they are with the high insurance from which their competitors are exempted it is certain the trade of britain must diminish while she is at war with us and the rest of europe in peace <\s>
<s> to evade this mischief she now begins to make use of french bottoms but as we have yet no treaty with france or any other power that gives to free ships the privilege of making free goods we may weaken that project by taking the goods of the enemy wherever we find them paying the freight <\s>
<s> and it is imagined that the captains of the vessels so freighted may by a little encouragement be prevailed on to facilitate the necessary discovery <\s>
<s> spain not having yet resolved to receive a minister from the congress mr franklin still remains here <\s>
<s> she has however afforded the aids we formerly mentioned and supplies of various articles have continued till lately to be sent consigned to mr gerry much of which we hear has safely arrived <\s>

<s> you will excuse our mentioning to you that our expenses here are necessarily very great though we live with as much frugality as our public character will permit <\s>

<s> gentlemen since ours to you by return of the packet from new hampshire and duplicates by mr mccreary from maryland we have not written nor have we received any of your favors during the last two months except a letter of old date april 19th signed by messrs deane and lee <\s>
<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>
<s> should this be the case general howe's visit cannot be of long duration <\s>
<s> you say that the vessels of the united states will be received at the havanna as those of france the most favored nation <\s>
<s> we wish to be exactly informed whether north american products may be carried thither or prizes be taken to and disposed of in that port or any other ports of his catholic majesty in america <\s>

<s> that court has been lately much employed in adjusting its differences with spain which it is said are now nearly all accommodated and that they will accede to the family compact <\s>
<s> this court continues the same conduct that it has held ever since our arrival <\s>
<s> it professes to england a resolution to observe all treaties and proves it by restoring prizes too openly brought into their ports imprisoning such persons as are found to be concerned in fitting out armed vessels against england from france warning frequently those from america to depart and repeating orders against the exportation of warlike stores <\s>
<s> to us it privately professes a real friendship wishes success to our cause winks at the supplies we obtain here as much as it can without giving open grounds of complaint to england privately affords us very essential aids and goes on preparing for war <\s>
<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>
<s> in the mean time perhaps the delay may have this good effect for us that enjoying the whole harvest of plunder upon the british commerce which otherwise france and spain would divide with us our infant naval power finds such plentiful nourishment as has increased and must increase its growth and strength most marvellously <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>

<s> as the english goods cannot in foreign markets face those of the french or dutch loaded as they are with the high insurance from which their competitors are exempted it is certain the trade of britain must diminish while she is at war with us and the rest of europe in peace <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>
<s> should this be the case general howe's visit cannot be of long duration <\s>

<s> there appears in that as well as in every other country in europe a disposition to share in our commerce and to oblige us as far as may be done without offending england <\s>

<s> that court has been lately much employed in adjusting its differences with spain which it is said are now nearly all accommodated and that they will accede to the family compact <\s>
<s> this court continues the same conduct that it has held ever since our arrival <\s>
<s> it professes to england a resolution to observe all treaties and proves it by restoring prizes too openly brought into their ports imprisoning such persons as are found to be concerned in fitting out armed vessels against england from france warning frequently those from america to depart and repeating orders against the exportation of warlike stores <\s>
<s> to us it privately professes a real friendship wishes success to our cause winks at the supplies we obtain here as much as it can without giving open grounds of complaint to england privately affords us very essential aids and goes on preparing for war <\s>
<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>
<s> in the mean time perhaps the delay may have this good effect for us that enjoying the whole harvest of plunder upon the british commerce which otherwise france and spain would divide with us our infant naval power finds such plentiful nourishment as has increased and must increase its growth and strength most marvellously <\s>
<s> it gave us great joy to hear of the arrival of the mercury amphitrite and other vessels carrying supplies <\s>
<s> another ship with a similar cargo which had long been detained at marseilles we hope will soon arrive with you <\s>
<s> we hope also that you will receive between twenty and thirty thousand suits of clothes before winter and from time to time quantities of new and good arms which we are purchasing in different parts of europe <\s>
<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>
<s> but if the present campaign should end favorably for us perhaps we may be able to accomplish it another year as some jealousy begins to be entertained of the english funds by the dutch and other monied people of europe to the increase of which jealousy we hope a paper 41 we have drawn up a copy whereof we enclose may in some degree contribute when made public <\s>

<s> as the english goods cannot in foreign markets face those of the french or dutch loaded as they are with the high insurance from which their competitors are exempted it is certain the trade of britain must diminish while she is at war with us and the rest of europe in peace <\s>
<s> to evade this mischief she now begins to make use of french bottoms but as we have yet no treaty with france or any other power that gives to free ships the privilege of making free goods we may weaken that project by taking the goods of the enemy wherever we find them paying the freight <\s>

<s> gentlemen since ours to you by return of the packet from new hampshire and duplicates by mr mccreary from maryland we have not written nor have we received any of your favors during the last two months except a letter of old date april 19th signed by messrs deane and lee <\s>
<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>
<s> should this be the case general howe's visit cannot be of long duration <\s>
<s> you say that the vessels of the united states will be received at the havanna as those of france the most favored nation <\s>
<s> we wish to be exactly informed whether north american products may be carried thither or prizes be taken to and disposed of in that port or any other ports of his catholic majesty in america <\s>

<s> that court has been lately much employed in adjusting its differences with spain which it is said are now nearly all accommodated and that they will accede to the family compact <\s>
<s> this court continues the same conduct that it has held ever since our arrival <\s>
<s> it professes to england a resolution to observe all treaties and proves it by restoring prizes too openly brought into their ports imprisoning such persons as are found to be concerned in fitting out armed vessels against england from france warning frequently those from america to depart and repeating orders against the exportation of warlike stores <\s>
<s> to us it privately professes a real friendship wishes success to our cause winks at the supplies we obtain here as much as it can without giving open grounds of complaint to england privately affords us very essential aids and goes on preparing for war <\s>
<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>
<s> in the mean time perhaps the delay may have this good effect for us that enjoying the whole harvest of plunder upon the british commerce which otherwise france and spain would divide with us our infant naval power finds such plentiful nourishment as has increased and must increase its growth and strength most marvellously <\s>
<s> it gave us great joy to hear of the arrival of the mercury amphitrite and other vessels carrying supplies <\s>

<s> we hope also that you will receive between twenty and thirty thousand suits of clothes before winter and from time to time quantities of new and good arms which we are purchasing in different parts of europe <\s>
<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>
<s> but if the present campaign should end favorably for us perhaps we may be able to accomplish it another year as some jealousy begins to be entertained of the english funds by the dutch and other monied people of europe to the increase of which jealousy we hope a paper 41 we have drawn up a copy whereof we enclose may in some degree contribute when made public <\s>

<s> as the english goods cannot in foreign markets face those of the french or dutch loaded as they are with the high insurance from which their competitors are exempted it is certain the trade of britain must diminish while she is at war with us and the rest of europe in peace <\s>
<s> to evade this mischief she now begins to make use of french bottoms but as we have yet no treaty with france or any other power that gives to free ships the privilege of making free goods we may weaken that project by taking the goods of the enemy wherever we find them paying the freight <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>
<s> should this be the case general howe's visit cannot be of long duration <\s>

<s> gentlemen it is long since we had a line from you the last received being of the date of we suppose from the same causes which have occasioned your hearing so seldom from us the difficulty of finding safe conveyances and sometimes the loss of the despatches by the way <\s>
<s> mr lee informs you we suppose of his negotiations in prussia and his safe return hither <\s>
<s> there appears in that as well as in every other country in europe a disposition to share in our commerce and to oblige us as far as may be done without offending england <\s>
<s> we have numbers of letters from eminent houses there proposing to furnish us with a variety of commodities at reasonable rates to be received by us in europe and paid for here <\s>
<s> we advise them to send their goods in their own ships and protect their own trade to and from our coasts <\s>
<s> we enclose you a copy of the memorial 40 we sent to portugal to which we have yet received no answer <\s>
<s> that court has been lately much employed in adjusting its differences with spain which it is said are now nearly all accommodated and that they will accede to the family compact <\s>
<s> this court continues the same conduct that it has held ever since our arrival <\s>
<s> it professes to england a resolution to observe all treaties and proves it by restoring prizes too openly brought into their ports imprisoning such persons as are found to be concerned in fitting out armed vessels against england from france warning frequently those from america to depart and repeating orders against the exportation of warlike stores <\s>
<s> to us it privately professes a real friendship wishes success to our cause winks at the supplies we obtain here as much as it can without giving open grounds of complaint to england privately affords us very essential aids and goes on preparing for war <\s>
<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>
<s> in the mean time perhaps the delay may have this good effect for us that enjoying the whole harvest of plunder upon the british commerce which otherwise france and spain would divide with us our infant naval power finds such plentiful nourishment as has increased and must increase its growth and strength most marvellously <\s>
<s> it gave us great joy to hear of the arrival of the mercury amphitrite and other vessels carrying supplies <\s>
<s> another ship with a similar cargo which had long been detained at marseilles we hope will soon arrive with you <\s>
<s> we hope also that you will receive between twenty and thirty thousand suits of clothes before winter and from time to time quantities of new and good arms which we are purchasing in different parts of europe <\s>
<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>
<s> but if the present campaign should end favorably for us perhaps we may be able to accomplish it another year as some jealousy begins to be entertained of the english funds by the dutch and other monied people of europe to the increase of which jealousy we hope a paper 41 we have drawn up a copy whereof we enclose may in some degree contribute when made public <\s>

<s> the ostensible letter and answer from and to the minister of foreign affairs copies of which we enclose 43 will show the conduct which the court has thought and thinks itself at present obliged to hold with regard to our cruisers and their prizes of which it seems fit some notice should be given to the several states <\s>
<s> as the english goods cannot in foreign markets face those of the french or dutch loaded as they are with the high insurance from which their competitors are exempted it is certain the trade of britain must diminish while she is at war with us and the rest of europe in peace <\s>
<s> to evade this mischief she now begins to make use of french bottoms but as we have yet no treaty with france or any other power that gives to free ships the privilege of making free goods we may weaken that project by taking the goods of the enemy wherever we find them paying the freight <\s>
<s> and it is imagined that the captains of the vessels so freighted may by a little encouragement be prevailed on to facilitate the necessary discovery <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> mr lee informs you we suppose of his negotiations in prussia and his safe return hither <\s>
<s> there appears in that as well as in every other country in europe a disposition to share in our commerce and to oblige us as far as may be done without offending england <\s>
<s> we have numbers of letters from eminent houses there proposing to furnish us with a variety of commodities at reasonable rates to be received by us in europe and paid for here <\s>
<s> we advise them to send their goods in their own ships and protect their own trade to and from our coasts <\s>

<s> that court has been lately much employed in adjusting its differences with spain which it is said are now nearly all accommodated and that they will accede to the family compact <\s>
<s> this court continues the same conduct that it has held ever since our arrival <\s>
<s> it professes to england a resolution to observe all treaties and proves it by restoring prizes too openly brought into their ports imprisoning such persons as are found to be concerned in fitting out armed vessels against england from france warning frequently those from america to depart and repeating orders against the exportation of warlike stores <\s>
<s> to us it privately professes a real friendship wishes success to our cause winks at the supplies we obtain here as much as it can without giving open grounds of complaint to england privately affords us very essential aids and goes on preparing for war <\s>
<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>
<s> in the mean time perhaps the delay may have this good effect for us that enjoying the whole harvest of plunder upon the british commerce which otherwise france and spain would divide with us our infant naval power finds such plentiful nourishment as has increased and must increase its growth and strength most marvellously <\s>
<s> it gave us great joy to hear of the arrival of the mercury amphitrite and other vessels carrying supplies <\s>
<s> another ship with a similar cargo which had long been detained at marseilles we hope will soon arrive with you <\s>
<s> we hope also that you will receive between twenty and thirty thousand suits of clothes before winter and from time to time quantities of new and good arms which we are purchasing in different parts of europe <\s>
<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>
<s> but if the present campaign should end favorably for us perhaps we may be able to accomplish it another year as some jealousy begins to be entertained of the english funds by the dutch and other monied people of europe to the increase of which jealousy we hope a paper 41 we have drawn up a copy whereof we enclose may in some degree contribute when made public <\s>

<s> as the english goods cannot in foreign markets face those of the french or dutch loaded as they are with the high insurance from which their competitors are exempted it is certain the trade of britain must diminish while she is at war with us and the rest of europe in peace <\s>
<s> to evade this mischief she now begins to make use of french bottoms but as we have yet no treaty with france or any other power that gives to free ships the privilege of making free goods we may weaken that project by taking the goods of the enemy wherever we find them paying the freight <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> gentlemen it is long since we had a line from you the last received being of the date of we suppose from the same causes which have occasioned your hearing so seldom from us the difficulty of finding safe conveyances and sometimes the loss of the despatches by the way <\s>
<s> mr lee informs you we suppose of his negotiations in prussia and his safe return hither <\s>
<s> there appears in that as well as in every other country in europe a disposition to share in our commerce and to oblige us as far as may be done without offending england <\s>
<s> we have numbers of letters from eminent houses there proposing to furnish us with a variety of commodities at reasonable rates to be received by us in europe and paid for here <\s>
<s> we advise them to send their goods in their own ships and protect their own trade to and from our coasts <\s>
<s> we enclose you a copy of the memorial 40 we sent to portugal to which we have yet received no answer <\s>
<s> that court has been lately much employed in adjusting its differences with spain which it is said are now nearly all accommodated and that they will accede to the family compact <\s>
<s> this court continues the same conduct that it has held ever since our arrival <\s>
<s> it professes to england a resolution to observe all treaties and proves it by restoring prizes too openly brought into their ports imprisoning such persons as are found to be concerned in fitting out armed vessels against england from france warning frequently those from america to depart and repeating orders against the exportation of warlike stores <\s>
<s> to us it privately professes a real friendship wishes success to our cause winks at the supplies we obtain here as much as it can without giving open grounds of complaint to england privately affords us very essential aids and goes on preparing for war <\s>
<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>
<s> in the mean time perhaps the delay may have this good effect for us that enjoying the whole harvest of plunder upon the british commerce which otherwise france and spain would divide with us our infant naval power finds such plentiful nourishment as has increased and must increase its growth and strength most marvellously <\s>
<s> it gave us great joy to hear of the arrival of the mercury amphitrite and other vessels carrying supplies <\s>
<s> another ship with a similar cargo which had long been detained at marseilles we hope will soon arrive with you <\s>
<s> we hope also that you will receive between twenty and thirty thousand suits of clothes before winter and from time to time quantities of new and good arms which we are purchasing in different parts of europe <\s>
<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>
<s> but if the present campaign should end favorably for us perhaps we may be able to accomplish it another year as some jealousy begins to be entertained of the english funds by the dutch and other monied people of europe to the increase of which jealousy we hope a paper 41 we have drawn up a copy whereof we enclose may in some degree contribute when made public <\s>
<s> mr deane has written fully to you on the effect our cruisers have had on the coast and commerce of britain which makes our saying much on that head unnecessary 42 we cannot however omit this opportunity of expressing our satisfaction in the conduct of the captains and of recommending them warmly to congress <\s>
<s> the ostensible letter and answer from and to the minister of foreign affairs copies of which we enclose 43 will show the conduct which the court has thought and thinks itself at present obliged to hold with regard to our cruisers and their prizes of which it seems fit some notice should be given to the several states <\s>
<s> as the english goods cannot in foreign markets face those of the french or dutch loaded as they are with the high insurance from which their competitors are exempted it is certain the trade of britain must diminish while she is at war with us and the rest of europe in peace <\s>
<s> to evade this mischief she now begins to make use of french bottoms but as we have yet no treaty with france or any other power that gives to free ships the privilege of making free goods we may weaken that project by taking the goods of the enemy wherever we find them paying the freight <\s>
<s> and it is imagined that the captains of the vessels so freighted may by a little encouragement be prevailed on to facilitate the necessary discovery <\s>
<s> spain not having yet resolved to receive a minister from the congress mr franklin still remains here <\s>
<s> she has however afforded the aids we formerly mentioned and supplies of various articles have continued till lately to be sent consigned to mr gerry much of which we hear has safely arrived <\s>
<s> we shall use our best endeavors to obtain a continuance and increase of those aids <\s>
<s> you will excuse our mentioning to you that our expenses here are necessarily very great though we live with as much frugality as our public character will permit <\s>

<s> gentlemen since ours to you by return of the packet from new hampshire and duplicates by mr mccreary from maryland we have not written nor have we received any of your favors during the last two months except a letter of old date april 19th signed by messrs deane and lee <\s>
<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>
<s> should this be the case general howe's visit cannot be of long duration <\s>
<s> you say that the vessels of the united states will be received at the havanna as those of france the most favored nation <\s>
<s> we wish to be exactly informed whether north american products may be carried thither or prizes be taken to and disposed of in that port or any other ports of his catholic majesty in america <\s>

<s> there appears in that as well as in every other country in europe a disposition to share in our commerce and to oblige us as far as may be done without offending england <\s>
<s> we have numbers of letters from eminent houses there proposing to furnish us with a variety of commodities at reasonable rates to be received by us in europe and paid for here <\s>

<s> that court has been lately much employed in adjusting its differences with spain which it is said are now nearly all accommodated and that they will accede to the family compact <\s>
<s> this court continues the same conduct that it has held ever since our arrival <\s>
<s> it professes to england a resolution to observe all treaties and proves it by restoring prizes too openly brought into their ports imprisoning such persons as are found to be concerned in fitting out armed vessels against england from france warning frequently those from america to depart and repeating orders against the exportation of warlike stores <\s>
<s> to us it privately professes a real friendship wishes success to our cause winks at the supplies we obtain here as much as it can without giving open grounds of complaint to england privately affords us very essential aids and goes on preparing for war <\s>
<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>
<s> in the mean time perhaps the delay may have this good effect for us that enjoying the whole harvest of plunder upon the british commerce which otherwise france and spain would divide with us our infant naval power finds such plentiful nourishment as has increased and must increase its growth and strength most marvellously <\s>
<s> it gave us great joy to hear of the arrival of the mercury amphitrite and other vessels carrying supplies <\s>
<s> another ship with a similar cargo which had long been detained at marseilles we hope will soon arrive with you <\s>
<s> we hope also that you will receive between twenty and thirty thousand suits of clothes before winter and from time to time quantities of new and good arms which we are purchasing in different parts of europe <\s>
<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>
<s> but if the present campaign should end favorably for us perhaps we may be able to accomplish it another year as some jealousy begins to be entertained of the english funds by the dutch and other monied people of europe to the increase of which jealousy we hope a paper 41 we have drawn up a copy whereof we enclose may in some degree contribute when made public <\s>

<s> as the english goods cannot in foreign markets face those of the french or dutch loaded as they are with the high insurance from which their competitors are exempted it is certain the trade of britain must diminish while she is at war with us and the rest of europe in peace <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>
<s> should this be the case general howe's visit cannot be of long duration <\s>

<s> that court has been lately much employed in adjusting its differences with spain which it is said are now nearly all accommodated and that they will accede to the family compact <\s>
<s> this court continues the same conduct that it has held ever since our arrival <\s>

<s> to us it privately professes a real friendship wishes success to our cause winks at the supplies we obtain here as much as it can without giving open grounds of complaint to england privately affords us very essential aids and goes on preparing for war <\s>
<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> this court continues the same conduct that it has held ever since our arrival <\s>
<s> it professes to england a resolution to observe all treaties and proves it by restoring prizes too openly brought into their ports imprisoning such persons as are found to be concerned in fitting out armed vessels against england from france warning frequently those from america to depart and repeating orders against the exportation of warlike stores <\s>
<s> to us it privately professes a real friendship wishes success to our cause winks at the supplies we obtain here as much as it can without giving open grounds of complaint to england privately affords us very essential aids and goes on preparing for war <\s>
<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>
<s> in the mean time perhaps the delay may have this good effect for us that enjoying the whole harvest of plunder upon the british commerce which otherwise france and spain would divide with us our infant naval power finds such plentiful nourishment as has increased and must increase its growth and strength most marvellously <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>

<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>

<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>

<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>
<s> but it is very far from being a clear point to us that the enemy will be able to hold philadelphia as we are yet masters of the delaware below and have hopes of keeping it so as to prevent the british fleet from getting up to the city <\s>

<s> to us it privately professes a real friendship wishes success to our cause winks at the supplies we obtain here as much as it can without giving open grounds of complaint to england privately affords us very essential aids and goes on preparing for war <\s>
<s> how long these two parts will continue to be acted at the same time and which will finally predominate may be a question <\s>
<s> as it is the true interest of france to prevent our being annexed to britain that so the british power may be diminished and the french commerce augmented we are inclined to believe the sincerity is towards us more especially as the united bent of the nation is manifestly in our favor their not having yet commenced a war is accounted for by various reasons <\s>
<s> the treaties subsisting among the powers of europe by which they are obliged to aid those attacked more than those attacking which it is supposed will make some difference the not being fully prepared the absence of their seamen in their fishery and west indies and the treasure expected from new spain with the sugars from the islands have all it is said contributed to restrain the national desire of a breach with england in which her troublesome power may be reduced the wealth and strength of france increased and some satisfaction obtained for the injuries received in the unfair commencement of the last war <\s>
<s> england too is extremely exasperated at the sight of her lost commerce enjoyed by france the favor our armed vessels have met with here and the distress of their remaining trade by our cruisers even on their own coasts and yet she seems afraid of beginning a war with this country and spain together while she has our war upon her hands <\s>
<s> in such a situation some accident may probably bring on a war sooner than is desired by either party <\s>
<s> in the mean time perhaps the delay may have this good effect for us that enjoying the whole harvest of plunder upon the british commerce which otherwise france and spain would divide with us our infant naval power finds such plentiful nourishment as has increased and must increase its growth and strength most marvellously <\s>
<s> it gave us great joy to hear of the arrival of the mercury amphitrite and other vessels carrying supplies <\s>
<s> another ship with a similar cargo which had long been detained at marseilles we hope will soon arrive with you <\s>
<s> we hope also that you will receive between twenty and thirty thousand suits of clothes before winter and from time to time quantities of new and good arms which we are purchasing in different parts of europe <\s>
<s> but we must desire you to remember that we are hitherto disappointed in your promises of remittance either by the difficulties you find in shipping or by captures and that though far short of completing your orders we are in danger of being greatly embarrassed by debts in failing in performance of our contracts and losing our credit with that of the congress for though we have received three quarterly payments of the two millions of livres formerly mentioned to you and expect the last next month our contracts go beyond and we must reserve the continuance of that aid for the purpose it was promised to answer your drafts for interest if that proposal of ours has been adopted <\s>
<s> particularly we beg you will attend to the affair of tobacco for the farmers-general with whom we have contracted to supply five thousand hogsheads of tobacco for which they have advanced us one million of livres in ready money and are to pay the rest on delivery as we formerly advised you <\s>
<s> your vigorous exertions in these matters are the more necessary as during the apparent or supposed uncertainty of our affairs the loan we were directed to obtain of two millions sterling has hitherto been judged impracticable <\s>
<s> but if the present campaign should end favorably for us perhaps we may be able to accomplish it another year as some jealousy begins to be entertained of the english funds by the dutch and other monied people of europe to the increase of which jealousy we hope a paper 41 we have drawn up a copy whereof we enclose may in some degree contribute when made public <\s>

<s> as the english goods cannot in foreign markets face those of the french or dutch loaded as they are with the high insurance from which their competitors are exempted it is certain the trade of britain must diminish while she is at war with us and the rest of europe in peace <\s>

<s> captain hammond being not yet arrived although he sailed in april it is too probable that he has fallen into the enemy's hands or miscarried at sea <\s>
<s> two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto because from your assurances we had cause to expect a monthly packet and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look for some more decisive event daily than had happened and which might warrant the expense of sending a particular packet as the casual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost entirely stopped by the number and vigilance of the enemy's cruisers <\s>
<s> we shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern and middle departments where alone it has raged since our last <\s>
<s> you were before apprized of the evacuation of ticonderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards albany <\s>
<s> general burgoyne was rapid in pursuit of his successes and pressed quickly on towards fort edward upon hudson's river about twenty miles above albany <\s>
<s> here his progress was interrupted by the american army being halted and reinforced a little below him <\s>
<s> this circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our enemies from their first successes on the lakes <\s>
<s> the better to effect his purpose general burgoyne had detached general st leger with a body of regular troops canadians and indians by the oneida lake and wood creek to take fort schuyler formerly stanwix and to make an impression along the mohawk river <\s>
<s> this part of his plan has been totally defeated by the bravery of general herkimer with the tryon county militia and by the gallant defence of fort schuyler by colonel gansevoort and lieutenant colonel willet <\s>
<s> the former of these met the enemy in the field defeated them and killed a great number of their indian allies <\s>
<s> this defeat being obtained by militia they dispersed as usual and left the enemy to collect and lay siege to fort schuyler which was defended with great gallantry by the two officers above mentioned until the approach of general arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the siege of that fortress and retreat with great precipitation leaving their baggage ammunition provisions and some of their artillery which fell into our hands <\s>
<s> another body of troops was detached by general burgoyne under command of lieutenant colonel baum to the eastward for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the troopers provisions and teams for the use of the army <\s>
<s> this detachment was met attacked and defeated by the brave general stark and the new hampshire militia at a place called bennington and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of fifteen hundred regular troops posted behind works fortified with cannon by two thousand militia <\s>
<s> the two wings of general burgoyne being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack general gates who commands the northern army and who was well posted at behmus's heights <\s>
<s> the consequence of this attack you will see related by general gates himself among the enclosed papers as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the lakes george and champlain by colonel brown who had been detached by general lincoln who is also in general burgoyne's rear with a strong body of troops <\s>
<s> surrounded as it is on all sides with little prospect of safe retreat and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reinforcements we hope ere long to give you information of definitive success over the british army in that quarter <\s>
<s> an aid of general gates who brought us these last accounts says that by the concurring testimony of prisoners deserters and some of our own people who escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than one thousand or twelve hundred men in killed wounded and missing and that general burgoyne himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball <\s>
<s> in the middle department the war has been less favorable to us as you will see by what follows <\s>
<s> about the middle of august the british fleet appeared in the chesapeake bay and landed general howe's army at the head of elk about fifty miles from philadelphia <\s>
<s> general washington's army which had crossed the delaware on the embarkation of the british troops and the appearance of the fleet off the capes of that river now proceeded to meet the enemy and came up with them near wilmington <\s>
<s> after various skirmishes and manoeuvres a general engagement took place at chad's ford over the brandywine on the 11th of september last <\s>
<s> this battle terminated in our leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine pieces of our artillery <\s>
<s> our loss in killed wounded and missing did not exceed six hundred that of the enemy as far as we have been able to get information was near two thousand <\s>
<s> an orderly taken from them since the battle makes it nineteen hundred 44 general washington retreated across the schuylkill and having refreshed his army recrossed that river in two days after the former battle with design to attack the enemy who remained close by the field of action until he came up with them again <\s>
<s> to be the better prepared for battle and to be guarded against the consequences of defeat our army marched without baggage and left their tents behind <\s>
<s> in this situation and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy a heavy long continued and cold rain with high wind came on and prevented it <\s>
<s> the ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use the arms injured and the troops a good deal hurt and dispirited <\s>
<s> in this state of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety in order to clean the arms replace the cartridges and refresh the men <\s>
<s> the enemy were also without tents but they have good blankets are better clothed and have tin receptacles for keeping dry their cartridges <\s>
<s> general howe judging of our situation put his army in motion and endeavored to harrass and distress us by marches countermarches and frequent shows of designing to give battle <\s>
<s> after a variety of manoeuvres the enemy crossed the schuylkill below our army and marching to philadelphia have possessed themselves of that city <\s>
<s> general washington having refreshed his men and being reinforced is moving now towards the enemy <\s>
<s> this unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals and by the distress and harrassment of the army consequent thereupon <\s>
<s> however they are recovering again and we hope before long will give general howe reason to repent his possession of philadelphia <\s>
<s> the real injury to america from the enemy's possession of that city is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine unless the report and misconceptions of this matter in europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies <\s>
<s> but we rely on your careful and just representation of this matter to prevent the ill impressions which it may otherwise make <\s>
<s> when this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first congress but we are blessed with an extensive sea coast by which we can convey and receive benefits independent of any particular spot <\s>

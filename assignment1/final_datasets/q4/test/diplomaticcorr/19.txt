<s> sir we have been honored with your letter of the 26th of october and we thank your excellency for the prompt and generous manner in which you have given liberty to four of our countrymen who were among the prisoners at denant <\s>
<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>
<s> we enclose a copy of this last letter and have the honor to request a similar indulgence to all the ten <\s>
<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> if the same evasions continue to be practised amsterdam will display other resources which have not yet been communicated to me <\s>
<s> the subject of the convoy will be discussed next week <\s>
<s> yorke presented a memorial the day before yesterday more moderate in its tone but equally insidious in reality on behalf of his court <\s>
<s> it demands the appointment of commissioners with whom he may consult to settle the intent of the treaties relative to the articles which it is desired to prohibit <\s>
<s> it declares that his court is desirous that the republic would not grant the convoys in question as it cannot consent to allow the above mentioned articles to pass <\s>
<s> he will find formidable adversaries from amsterdam who are firmly resolved on an absolute negative on these two points <\s>

<s> the project with which you are acquainted is prepared with some changes and additions on the basis already known to you <\s>
<s> it is in the hands of the burgomasters who will examine the whole after which a copy will be delivered to me that i may also transmit one to you to be examined by you in the same manner and that your observations thereon may be communicated to them through me <\s>
<s> i have been assured on behalf of the burgomasters that it is not their intention to leave our future connexions dependent on great britain on the contrary it is their wish that in course of time their high mightinesses may adopt a better system of measures than is at present possible this circumstance they have thought ought not to be concealed from you any more than their present situation their wishes and their expectation that you will be ready to concur in the steps which it shall be in their power to take towards realising them <\s>
<s> on the whole gentlemen i cannot give you a more clear idea of the whole matter than the following we correspond with a minority which has this advantage over that of england that if this republic will not declare itself our friend it cannot be our enemy on account of the unanimity required by the constitution this circumstance alone is of high importance and ought to persuade us to assist and confirm that minority <\s>

<s> we do not find ourselves authorised to treat with those powers as they are not in europe and indeed we are not furnished with funds for making them presents <\s>
<s> we have had the honor of a copy from the auditor general enclosing the form of bills of exchange to be drawn upon us for the interest due upon loan office certificates and acquainting us that this interest will amount to two millions and a half of livres annually <\s>
<s> when it was proposed to pay the interest here we had no idea of so much being borrowed <\s>
<s> we shall pay the most punctual obedience to these and all other orders of congress as long as our funds shall last <\s>
<s> but we are obliged to inform congress that expenses on prisoners being great and being drawn upon by the order of congress from various quarters and receiving no funds from america we suffer the utmost anxiety lest we should be obliged to protest bills <\s>
<s> we have exerted ourselves to the utmost of our power to procure money but hitherto with little success <\s>

<s> we shall take the first opportunity of a frigate to send it to congress <\s>
<s> we enclose to congress copies of a correspondence between the ambassador of the king of the two sicilies and us which as his majesty is the eldest son of the king of spain is considered as an event indicative of the good will of a greater power although this is respectable <\s>
<s> it is of great importance to penetrate the councils of an enemy in order to be prepared beforehand against his designs we shall therefore be happy to advise congress of the intentions of great britain as far as we conjecture <\s>
<s> we have every reason to believe that the hostility of the disposition of the british court has no other bounds but those of their power <\s>

<s> the interest of the king of prussia and of the empress queen who both choose at present to pursue decent terms with great britain to prevent a close alliance between england and russia we apprehend will prevent it <\s>
<s> in short we see no probability of england's forming any alliance against america in all europe or indeed against france whereas on the other side from the astonishing preparations of spain the family compact and other circumstances and from the insolent tyranny of the english over the dutch and their consequent resentment which has shown itself in formidable remonstrances as well as advances towards a treaty with us there is reason to believe that if great britain perseveres in the war both of these powers will at length be involved in it <\s>

<s> sir we have been honored with your letter of the 26th of october and we thank your excellency for the prompt and generous manner in which you have given liberty to four of our countrymen who were among the prisoners at denant <\s>
<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>
<s> we enclose a copy of this last letter and have the honor to request a similar indulgence to all the ten <\s>
<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> sir we have been honored with your letter of the 26th of october and we thank your excellency for the prompt and generous manner in which you have given liberty to four of our countrymen who were among the prisoners at denant <\s>
<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>

<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>
<s> we enclose a copy of this last letter and have the honor to request a similar indulgence to all the ten <\s>
<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> gentlemen the gentlemen from amsterdam have returned with more strict instructions from their constituents <\s>
<s> they will be followed perhaps by a third memorial more forcible than the preceding <\s>
<s> if the same evasions continue to be practised amsterdam will display other resources which have not yet been communicated to me <\s>
<s> the subject of the convoy will be discussed next week <\s>
<s> yorke presented a memorial the day before yesterday more moderate in its tone but equally insidious in reality on behalf of his court <\s>
<s> it demands the appointment of commissioners with whom he may consult to settle the intent of the treaties relative to the articles which it is desired to prohibit <\s>
<s> it declares that his court is desirous that the republic would not grant the convoys in question as it cannot consent to allow the above mentioned articles to pass <\s>
<s> he will find formidable adversaries from amsterdam who are firmly resolved on an absolute negative on these two points <\s>
<s> a certain great personage and the grand pentionary are already prepossessed on the subject <\s>
<s> the irritation against the english gains also in some of the nobility <\s>
<s> the project with which you are acquainted is prepared with some changes and additions on the basis already known to you <\s>
<s> it is in the hands of the burgomasters who will examine the whole after which a copy will be delivered to me that i may also transmit one to you to be examined by you in the same manner and that your observations thereon may be communicated to them through me <\s>
<s> i have been assured on behalf of the burgomasters that it is not their intention to leave our future connexions dependent on great britain on the contrary it is their wish that in course of time their high mightinesses may adopt a better system of measures than is at present possible this circumstance they have thought ought not to be concealed from you any more than their present situation their wishes and their expectation that you will be ready to concur in the steps which it shall be in their power to take towards realising them <\s>
<s> on the whole gentlemen i cannot give you a more clear idea of the whole matter than the following we correspond with a minority which has this advantage over that of england that if this republic will not declare itself our friend it cannot be our enemy on account of the unanimity required by the constitution this circumstance alone is of high importance and ought to persuade us to assist and confirm that minority <\s>
<s> every time i see our friend he begs me not to fail to communicate to him immediately any good news i may receive from america <\s>

<s> sir we have the honor of your excellency's letter of the 6th of this month but as the memoir of the french surgeon which your excellency proposed to transmit to us was by some accident omitted to be enclosed in your letter we are ignorant of his case and consequently unable to inform your excellency whether it is in our power to afford him any relief <\s>
<s> if your excellency will have the goodness to send us the memoir we will answer your letter without delay <\s>
<s> in the meantime we may acquaint your excellency that the united states have not adopted any precautions for sending succors to their subjects imprisoned in england <\s>
<s> we have ventured without orders or permission from the united states to lend small sums of money to persons who have escaped from irons and dungeons in great britain to bear their expenses to nantes l'orient and bordeaux <\s>
<s> but we have sent no succor to them while in england except a small sum of money put into the hands of mr hartley to be disposed of by him for the relief of such as should most want it <\s>
<s> we shall consider every frenchman taken by the english on board of american vessels in the same light as if he was an american by birth and entitled to the same assistance from us as americans are in the same situation <\s>

<s> passy november 7th 1778 <\s>
<s> sir we have the honor to enclose a copy of the declaration concerning the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty of commerce which we have received from his excellency the secretary of state for foreign affairs in exchange for a similar one signed by us in pursuance of the instructions of congress <\s>
<s> we have also the honor to enclose copies of a correspondence with his excellency m <\s>
<s> de sartine the secretary of state for the marine concerning cases of recaptures that congress may if they judge proper take some resolution on this head it seems to be equitable that the same rule should be observed by both nations <\s>
<s> we also enclose copies of a correspondence on the subject of negotiation with the barbary states <\s>
<s> we do not find ourselves authorised to treat with those powers as they are not in europe and indeed we are not furnished with funds for making them presents <\s>
<s> we have had the honor of a copy from the auditor general enclosing the form of bills of exchange to be drawn upon us for the interest due upon loan office certificates and acquainting us that this interest will amount to two millions and a half of livres annually <\s>
<s> when it was proposed to pay the interest here we had no idea of so much being borrowed <\s>
<s> we shall pay the most punctual obedience to these and all other orders of congress as long as our funds shall last <\s>
<s> but we are obliged to inform congress that expenses on prisoners being great and being drawn upon by the order of congress from various quarters and receiving no funds from america we suffer the utmost anxiety lest we should be obliged to protest bills <\s>
<s> we have exerted ourselves to the utmost of our power to procure money but hitherto with little success <\s>
<s> and we beg that some supplies may be sent us as soon as possible <\s>
<s> we are very sorry that we are not able to send to congress those supplies of arms ammunition and clothing which they have ordered but it is absolutely impossible for the want of funds and m <\s>
<s> beaumarchais has not yet informed us whether he will execute the agreement made for him with you or not <\s>
<s> we have the pleasure to inform congress that mr matthew ridley of maryland has made a present to the united states of a valuable manuscript upon naval affairs which he has left with us <\s>
<s> we shall take the first opportunity of a frigate to send it to congress <\s>
<s> we enclose to congress copies of a correspondence between the ambassador of the king of the two sicilies and us which as his majesty is the eldest son of the king of spain is considered as an event indicative of the good will of a greater power although this is respectable <\s>
<s> it is of great importance to penetrate the councils of an enemy in order to be prepared beforehand against his designs we shall therefore be happy to advise congress of the intentions of great britain as far as we conjecture <\s>
<s> we have every reason to believe that the hostility of the disposition of the british court has no other bounds but those of their power <\s>
<s> their threats however of large reinforcements and of russian auxiliaries are without foundation <\s>
<s> the interest of the king of prussia and of the empress queen who both choose at present to pursue decent terms with great britain to prevent a close alliance between england and russia we apprehend will prevent it <\s>
<s> in short we see no probability of england's forming any alliance against america in all europe or indeed against france whereas on the other side from the astonishing preparations of spain the family compact and other circumstances and from the insolent tyranny of the english over the dutch and their consequent resentment which has shown itself in formidable remonstrances as well as advances towards a treaty with us there is reason to believe that if great britain perseveres in the war both of these powers will at length be involved in it <\s>
<s> we had the honor to write to congress on the 20th of july and the 17th of september of which we have sent duplicates and triplicates and to which we beg leave to refer <\s>
<s> by this opportunity we shall send the newspapers which contain all the public intelligence <\s>

<s> sir we have been honored with your letter of the 26th of october and we thank your excellency for the prompt and generous manner in which you have given liberty to four of our countrymen who were among the prisoners at denant <\s>
<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>
<s> we enclose a copy of this last letter and have the honor to request a similar indulgence to all the ten <\s>
<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> sir we have been honored with your letter of the 26th of october and we thank your excellency for the prompt and generous manner in which you have given liberty to four of our countrymen who were among the prisoners at denant <\s>
<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>

<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> we do not find ourselves authorised to treat with those powers as they are not in europe and indeed we are not furnished with funds for making them presents <\s>

<s> sir we have been honored with your letter of the 26th of october and we thank your excellency for the prompt and generous manner in which you have given liberty to four of our countrymen who were among the prisoners at denant <\s>
<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>
<s> we enclose a copy of this last letter and have the honor to request a similar indulgence to all the ten <\s>
<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> sir we have been honored with your letter of the 26th of october and we thank your excellency for the prompt and generous manner in which you have given liberty to four of our countrymen who were among the prisoners at denant <\s>
<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>

<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> sir we have been honored with your letter of the 26th of october and we thank your excellency for the prompt and generous manner in which you have given liberty to four of our countrymen who were among the prisoners at denant <\s>
<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>
<s> we enclose a copy of this last letter and have the honor to request a similar indulgence to all the ten <\s>
<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> sir we have been honored with your letter of the 26th of october and we thank your excellency for the prompt and generous manner in which you have given liberty to four of our countrymen who were among the prisoners at denant <\s>
<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>

<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> sir we have been honored with your letter of the 26th of october and we thank your excellency for the prompt and generous manner in which you have given liberty to four of our countrymen who were among the prisoners at denant <\s>
<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>
<s> we enclose a copy of this last letter and have the honor to request a similar indulgence to all the ten <\s>
<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> sir we have been honored with your letter of the 26th of october and we thank your excellency for the prompt and generous manner in which you have given liberty to four of our countrymen who were among the prisoners at denant <\s>
<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>

<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> sir we have been honored with your letter of the 26th of october and we thank your excellency for the prompt and generous manner in which you have given liberty to four of our countrymen who were among the prisoners at denant <\s>
<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>
<s> we enclose a copy of this last letter and have the honor to request a similar indulgence to all the ten <\s>
<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> sir we have been honored with your letter of the 26th of october and we thank your excellency for the prompt and generous manner in which you have given liberty to four of our countrymen who were among the prisoners at denant <\s>
<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>

<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> sir we have been honored with your letter of the 26th of october and we thank your excellency for the prompt and generous manner in which you have given liberty to four of our countrymen who were among the prisoners at denant <\s>
<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>
<s> we enclose a copy of this last letter and have the honor to request a similar indulgence to all the ten <\s>
<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> sir we have been honored with your letter of the 26th of october and we thank your excellency for the prompt and generous manner in which you have given liberty to four of our countrymen who were among the prisoners at denant <\s>
<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>

<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> sir we have been honored with your letter of the 26th of october and we thank your excellency for the prompt and generous manner in which you have given liberty to four of our countrymen who were among the prisoners at denant <\s>
<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>
<s> we enclose a copy of this last letter and have the honor to request a similar indulgence to all the ten <\s>
<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> sir we have been honored with your letter of the 26th of october and we thank your excellency for the prompt and generous manner in which you have given liberty to four of our countrymen who were among the prisoners at denant <\s>
<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>

<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> sir we have been honored with your letter of the 26th of october and we thank your excellency for the prompt and generous manner in which you have given liberty to four of our countrymen who were among the prisoners at denant <\s>
<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>
<s> we enclose a copy of this last letter and have the honor to request a similar indulgence to all the ten <\s>
<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> sir we have been honored with your letter of the 26th of october and we thank your excellency for the prompt and generous manner in which you have given liberty to four of our countrymen who were among the prisoners at denant <\s>
<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>

<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> sir we have been honored with your letter of the 26th of october and we thank your excellency for the prompt and generous manner in which you have given liberty to four of our countrymen who were among the prisoners at denant <\s>
<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>
<s> we enclose a copy of this last letter and have the honor to request a similar indulgence to all the ten <\s>
<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> sir we have been honored with your letter of the 26th of october and we thank your excellency for the prompt and generous manner in which you have given liberty to four of our countrymen who were among the prisoners at denant <\s>
<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>

<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> sir we have been honored with your letter of the 26th of october and we thank your excellency for the prompt and generous manner in which you have given liberty to four of our countrymen who were among the prisoners at denant <\s>
<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>
<s> we enclose a copy of this last letter and have the honor to request a similar indulgence to all the ten <\s>
<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> sir we have been honored with your letter of the 26th of october and we thank your excellency for the prompt and generous manner in which you have given liberty to four of our countrymen who were among the prisoners at denant <\s>
<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>

<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> sir we have been honored with your letter of the 26th of october and we thank your excellency for the prompt and generous manner in which you have given liberty to four of our countrymen who were among the prisoners at denant <\s>
<s> such examples of benevolence cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the american mind <\s>
<s> since the receipt of your excellency's letter we have received another from the american prisoners at brest by which it appears that there are ten of them from four of whom only we had received letters when we wrote before the other six having written to us but their letters miscarried <\s>
<s> we enclose a copy of this last letter and have the honor to request a similar indulgence to all the ten <\s>
<s> by a letter we received last night from l'orient we have the pleasure to learn that three vessels bound to the coast of brazil have been taken by his majesty's frigates or by french cruisers and sent into that port <\s>
<s> it is very probable that the three masters of these vessels and every one of their sailors are americans <\s>
<s> we are happy in this opportunity of communicating to your excellency some intelligence which we have been at some pains to collect and have good reason to believe exactly true <\s>
<s> the english last year carried on a very valuable whale fishery on the coasts of brazil off the river plate in south america in the latitude 35 south from thence to 40 just on the edge of soundings off and on about the longitude 65 from london <\s>
<s> they have this year about seventeen vessels in the fishery which have all sailed in the months of september and october <\s>
<s> all the officers and almost all the men belonging to those seventeen vessels are americans from nantucket and cape cod in massachusetts excepting two or three from rhode island and perhaps one from long island <\s>
<s> the names of the captains are aaron sheffield of newport goldsmith and richard holmes from long island john chadwick francis may reuben may john meader jonathan meader elisha clark benjamin clark william ray paul pease reuben fitch zebedee coffin and another coffin all of nantucket john lock cape cod delano nantucket andrew swain nantucket william ray nantucket <\s>
<s> four or five of these vessels go to greenland the fleet sails to greenland the last of february or beginning of march <\s>
<s> there was published last year in the english newspapers and the same imposture has been repeated this year a letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de berdt in coleman street informing him that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil fleet <\s>
<s> but this we have certain information was a forgery calculated merely to deceive american privateers and that no convoy was appointed or did go with that fleet either last year or this <\s>
<s> for the captivity of a fishery so entirely defenceless for not one of the vessels has any arms a single frigate or privateer of twentyfour or even twenty guns would be quite sufficient <\s>
<s> the beginning of december would be the best time to proceed from hence because they would then find the whale vessels nearly loaded <\s>
<s> the cargoes of these vessels consisting of bone and oil will be very valuable and at least 450 of the best kind of seamen would be taken out of the hands of the english and might be gained into the american service to act against the enemy <\s>
<s> most of the officers and men wish well to their country and would gladly be in its service if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in <\s>
<s> but whenever the english men of war or privateers have taken an american vessel they have given to the whalemen among their crews their choice either to go on board a man of war and fight against their country or to go into the whale fishery <\s>
<s> so many have chosen the latter as to make up most of the crews of seventeen vessels <\s>
<s> we thought it proper to communicate this intelligence to your excellency that if you found it compatible with his majesty's service to order a frigate from hence or from the west indies to take from the english at once so profitable a branch of commerce and so valuable a nursery of seamen you may have an opportunity of doing it if not no inconvenience will ensue <\s>

<s> if the same evasions continue to be practised amsterdam will display other resources which have not yet been communicated to me <\s>
<s> the subject of the convoy will be discussed next week <\s>
<s> yorke presented a memorial the day before yesterday more moderate in its tone but equally insidious in reality on behalf of his court <\s>
<s> it demands the appointment of commissioners with whom he may consult to settle the intent of the treaties relative to the articles which it is desired to prohibit <\s>
<s> it declares that his court is desirous that the republic would not grant the convoys in question as it cannot consent to allow the above mentioned articles to pass <\s>

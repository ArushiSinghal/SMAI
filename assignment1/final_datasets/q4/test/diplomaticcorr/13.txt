<s> we observe that mr deane sent his despatches for this committee open to mr bingham <\s>

<s> the _west indiamen taken by our cruisers amount to 250 sail <\s>
<s> the scarcity of ships here is so great that we shall find much difficulty in making the extensive remittances to france that we ought in due season therefore it will in our opinion be an object of great importance to obtain the consent of the farmers-general to send to virginia and maryland for any quantity of tobacco they may choose or to the state of north carolina for any quantity of naval stores which may be wanted for public use or to supply the demands of private merchants <\s>

<s> sir you are to proceed with all the despatch in your power with the schooner jenifer under your command to nantes in france on your arrival there you are to apply to mr thomas morris if he should be at that port if he should not your application must be to messrs pliarne penet co who will furnish you with necessary cash for your journey to paris for which place you must set out immediately and deliver your despatches to messrs franklin deane and lee and wait their orders when they discharge you you are to return with the utmost diligence to america and put into the most convenient port to the southward of the delaware we think chincoteague or some other on the back of the eastern shore the most likely for avoiding men of war and would therefore have you attempt getting into one of those ports when arrived you must leave the schooner under the command of your mate and bring the despatches yourself to congress wherever it may be sitting <\s>
<s> you are before you set out for paris to consult with mr morris or the above gentlemen whether your vessel will not be most likely to escape the enemy by sending her to some other port to meet you on your return if this should be their opinion you are to give orders to your mate accordingly you are also to deliver your pig iron to the orders of those gentlemen and take from them such a quantity of military stores as will ballast your vessel <\s>
<s> the safe delivery of the despatches with which you are intrusted and the obtaining answers to them are matters of such immense consequence to the continent that we cannot too strongly recommend to you the avoiding all vessels that you may see either outward bound or on your return <\s>
<s> you are also to avoid as much as possible falling in with headlands and islands as it is most usual for men of war to cruise off such places <\s>
<s> the despatches will be delivered to you in a box which you must put into a bag with two shots that in case of falling in with an enemy from which you cannot escape you may be prepared to sink them which on such an event happening we earnestly insist on your doing <\s>
<s> we wish you a good voyage and safe return and are your most humble servants b <\s>
<s> s when you arrive at nantes inquire and get directions from the gentlemen there to whom you are recommended for cash to carry you to paris where dr franklin mr deane or mr arthur lee lodge in paris and above all things take care not to let it be known at nantes from whence you come your business or where you are going except to the above gentlemen <\s>
<s> to the committee of secret correspondence <\s>
<s> paris 17th january 1777 <\s>
<s> gentlemen we joined each other at this place on the 22d of december and on the 28th _had an audience of his excellency the count de vergennes one of his most christian majesty's principal secretaries of state and minister for foreign affairs <\s>
<s> we laid before him our commission with the articles of the proposed treaty of commerce 28 he assured us of the protection of his court and that due consideration should be given to what we offered <\s>
<s> soon after we presented a memoir of the present situation of our states drawn up at the minister's request together with the articles of general confederation and the demands for ships of war agreeable to our instructions <\s>
<s> copies of all these papers were given by us to the count d'aranda his catholic majesty's ambassador here to be communicated to his court <\s>
<s> we are promised an answer from this court as soon as they can know the determination of spain with which they mean to act in perfect unanimity <\s>
<s> in the mean time we are endeavoring to expedite several vessels laden with artillery arms ammunition and clothing which we hope will reach you in time for the campaign though unfortunately one vessel which mr deane had sent so laden has just put back after having been three weeks at sea <\s>
<s> she is however now sailed again <\s>
<s> the ports of france spain and florence that is leghorn in the mediterranean are open to the american cruisers upon the usual terms of neutrality <\s>
<s> we find it essential to the establishment and maintenance of your commercial credit in europe that your concerns of that kind should be in the hands of the most respectable men in the different countries <\s>
<s> from the observations we have made mr myrtle is not of that description and we are sorry to say that the irregularities of mr thomas morris render it absolutely necessary that some other person should be immediately appointed in his place <\s>
<s> we also think it advisable that you should be so far on your guard with respect to mons <\s>
<s> penet as not to deviate from the original contract made with him as we cannot learn that he is known to be a person of substance at the same time it is but justice to say that he appears to be active industrious and attentive to your interests <\s>
<s> he is indeed connected with a very good house in nantes m <\s>
<s> gruel but we know not the terms of that connexion or how far m <\s>
<s> it seems to us that those houses which are connected in great britain are to be avoided <\s>
<s> it would be useful if we had some blank commissions for privateers and we therefore wish some may be sent us by the first opportunity <\s>
<s> as vessels are almost daily arriving from america at the ports here we conceive advices of the proceedings in the campaign might be frequently sent to us so as to enable us to contradict the exaggerated representations made by the english of their successes which standing uncontroverted have a considerable influence upon our credit and upon our cause <\s>
<s> great efforts are now making by the british government to procure more troops from germany <\s>
<s> the princes in alliance with france have refused to lend any or to enter into any guarantee of hanover which england has been mean enough to ask being apprehensive for that electorate if she should draw from it more of its troops <\s>
<s> four more regiments two of them to be light horse are raising in hesse where there has been an insurrection on account of drafting the people and now great sums of money are distributed for procuring men <\s>
<s> they talk of ten thousand men in all to be sent over this spring <\s>
<s> these things do not look as if england was very confident of success in the next campaign without more aid <\s>
<s> the hearts of the french are universally for us and the cry is strong for immediate war with britain <\s>
<s> indeed every thing tends that way but the court has its reasons for postponing it a little longer <\s>
<s> in the mean time preparations are making for it <\s>
<s> they have already a fleet of twentysix sail of the line manned and fit for sea <\s>
<s> spain has seventeen sail in the same state and more are fitting with such diligence that they reckon to have thirty sail in each kingdom by the month of april <\s>
<s> this must have an immediate good effect in our favor as it keeps the english fleet at bay coops up their seamen of whom they will scarce find enough to man their next set of transports and probably keep lord howe's fleet more together for fear of a visit and leave us more sea room to prey upon their commerce and a freer coast to bring in our prizes and also the supplies we shall be able to send you in consequence of our agreement with the farmers-general which is that the congress shall provide purchasing bona fide at the lowest price possible twenty thousand hogsheads of tobacco in virginia and maryland at the public warehouses in those states for the ships which they the farmers-general shall send and that those tobaccos shall be brought to france at their risk and in their ships <\s>
<s> they understand the price is not likely to exceed three or four french sous in america but we do not warrant that it shall cost no more though we hope it will not <\s>
<s> upon these conditions we are to have half the supposed price advanced immediately and the opportunity of shipping warlike stores on board their ships at your risk and paying reasonable freights the rest to be paid as soon as advice is received that the tobacco is shipped <\s>
<s> the desire of getting money immediately to command the preparations for the ensuing campaign and of interesting so powerful a body as the farmers-general who in fact make the most efficient part of government here and the absolute part in all commercial or monied concerns induced us to concede to these terms which may possibly in the estimate of the price of tobacco be low but which upon the whole we judged necessary and we hope will be advantageous <\s>
<s> so strong is the inclination of the wealthy here to assist us that since this agreement we are offered a loan of two million of livres without interest and to be repaid when the united states are settled in peace and prosperity <\s>
<s> no conditions or securities are required not even an engagement from us <\s>
<s> we have accepted this generous and noble benefaction five hundred thousand livres or one quarter is to be paid into the hands of our banker this day and five hundred thousand more every three months <\s>
<s> as the ships we were ordered to hire or buy from this court cannot be obtained it being judged absolutely necessary to keep their whole naval force at home ready in case of a rupture we think of purchasing some elsewhere or of building in order as far as possible to answer the views of congress <\s>
<s> of this we shall write more fully in our next <\s>
<s> in the mean time we cannot but hint that this seems to us a fair opportunity of supporting the credit of the paper money you borrow as you may promise payment in specie of the interests and may draw upon us for the same with all confidence <\s>
<s> we cannot for several weighty reasons be more explicit at present but shall hereafter <\s>
<s> present our dutiful respects to the congress and assure them of our most faithful services <\s>

<s> 22d january our agreement with the farmers-general is not yet signed and perhaps some small changes may be made in it but as these will probably not be very material we wish measures may be taken immediately for the purchase of the tobacco <\s>
<s> we shall send by the next opportunity a copy of the contract <\s>
<s> we have received the five hundred thousand livres mentioned above it is now at our disposal in the hands of our banker who has orders to advance us the second payment if we desire it and he is ready to do it <\s>

<s> baltimore 1st february 1777 <\s>
<s> sir as we shall write you shortly again our attention at present will be confined chiefly to your favor of december 6th 1776 in which you mention the conduct of captain patterson <\s>
<s> we have laid your letter before congress and they have appointed a committee to consider of the most proper steps to be taken in this business that speedy and condign punishment may be applied to captain patterson when his crime shall be duly inquired into and established <\s>
<s> the congress having an utter abhorrence of all irregular and culpable violation of the law of nations and of that respect and friendship which they entertain for the french nation we wish you would communicate this to their excellencies the governor and general of martinique <\s>
<s> congress has referred the matter of remittance for discharge of the obligation which you and mr harrison have entered into to the state of maryland from whence you will no doubt receive remittance as soon as the british ships of war now in the chesapeake bay will permit <\s>
<s> it is a singular misfortune to us and very injurious to the commerce of france that we have not two or three line of battle ships which with our frigates and armed vessels would keep open our navigation in despite of great britain but at present one heavy ship affords protection to two or three frigates that would otherwise be easily removed and they place themselves so as to shut up the entrance into our principal trading states <\s>
<s> prior to the declaration of independence as it was not certain how soon our quarrel with great britain might be at an end our armies were enlisted for short periods and general howe having received information of the time when the troops would have it in their power to go home seized that opportunity for marching through the jerseys but his career was stopped at the delaware and he has since paid severely for that visit <\s>
<s> since the 24th of december the enemy have lost more than two thousand men in killed and made prisoners they have been glad to recall their troops from rhode island to defend new york from the attack of an army under general heath and their whole force in the jerseys is now collected on the brunswick heights where they are nearly surrounded by general washington's army and greatly distressed for forage fuel and other necessaries <\s>
<s> we enclose you the late newspapers for your perusal and remain sir your most obedient humble servants <\s>
<s> the committee of secret correspondence to the commissioners <\s>
<s> baltimore 2d february 1777 <\s>
<s> gentlemen you will receive enclosed copies of our letters of the 21st and 30th of december and of the resolves of congress accompanying them <\s>
<s> it concerns us not less than we are sure it will you that you should have heard so seldom from us but the vigilance of the british cruisers has prevented our most earnest solicitude for this purpose <\s>
<s> the manner in which they now conduct their business proves the necessity of the request made by congress for the loan or sale of a few capital ships <\s>
<s> the entrance into the delaware and chesapeake being narrow by placing one forty or fifty gun ship for the protection of their frigates they stop both our commerce and correspondence <\s>
<s> formerly their frigates protected their tenders but now that we have frigates their larger ships protect their frigates and this winter has been so uncommonly favorable that they have been able to keep the sea undisturbed by those severe gales of wind so usual off this coast in the winter season if we had a few line of battle ships to aid our frigates the commerce of north america so beneficial to ourselves and so advantageous to france would be carried on in spite of the opposition of great britain <\s>
<s> as we have not received any of those military stores and clothing promised by mr deane we have much reason to fear they have fallen into the enemy's hands and will render a fresh supply quite necessary <\s>
<s> except mr deane's favor of september 17th which is but just now received and that of october 1st we have been as destitute of european as we fear you have been of true american intelligence <\s>
<s> the enclosed papers will furnish you with authentic accounts of our successes against the enemy since the 24th of december <\s>
<s> they have paid severely for their visit of parade through the jerseys and these events are an abundant proof of british folly in attempting to subdue north america by force of arms <\s>
<s> although the short enlistments had dispersed our army directly in the face of a hostile force and thereby induced a proud enemy to suppose their work was done yet they suddenly found themselves attacked on all sides by a hardy active militia who have been constantly beating up their quarters and captivating and destroying their troops so that in the six or seven last weeks they have not lost fewer than three thousand men about two thousand of whom with many officers are now our prisoners <\s>
<s> instead of remaining cantoned in the pleasant villages of jersey as the enclosed authentic copy of mr howe's order to colonel donop the original of which fell into our hands by the colonel's flight from bordenton will show you that general vainly expected would be the case they are now collected upon the brunswick heights where they suffer every kind of distress from want of forage fuel and other necessaries whilst general washington's army of militia so environs them that they never show their faces beyond their lines but they get beaten back with loss and disgrace <\s>
<s> being thus situated we have reason to hope that this part of their army and which is the most considerable part will by the end of winter be reduced very low by deaths desertion and captivity <\s>
<s> general heath with a body of eastern troops is making an impression on new york by kingsbridge which we understand has obliged the enemy to recall their troops from rhode island for the defence of that city <\s>
<s> the regular corps that are to compose the new army are making up in the different states as fast as possible but arms artillery tent cloth and clothing will be greatly wanted <\s>
<s> for these our reliance is on the favor and friendship of his most christian majesty <\s>
<s> if you are so fortunate as to obtain them the propriety of sending them in a strong ship of war must be very evident to you gentlemen when you know our coasts are so covered with cruisers from twenty to fifty guns though but few of the latter <\s>

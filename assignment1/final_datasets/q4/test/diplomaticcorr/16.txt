<s> she is very large is to carry thirty 24 pounders on one deck and is supposed equal to a ship of the line <\s>
<s> but the infinite difficulties we find in equipping and manning such a ship in any neutral port under the restrictions of treaties together with the want of supplies from you have induced us to sell her to the king who by a large pension offered to our officer has engaged him to remain in his service and pays us what we have expended on her <\s>

<s> several other vessels some under the direction of mr ross others belonging to french merchants are almost ready to sail for america and we had thoughts of sending them in a little fleet under convoy of the raleigh and alfred but on consultation considering the spies maintained by england in all the ports and thence the impossibility of making up such a fleet without its being known so as to give time for a superior force to be in wait for it we concluded the chance better of their going off singly as they should be ready <\s>
<s> in these vessels are clothes ready made for thirty thousand men besides arms cloths linens and naval stores to a great amount bought up by us and mr ross <\s>
<s> the private adventures will also be very considerable <\s>
<s> and as we shall continue our endeavor to complete your orders we hope that if the ships have common success in passing you will be better provided for the next campaign than you have been for any of the preceding <\s>
<s> how we are enabled to make these supplies must be a matter of some surprise to you when you reflect that little or nothing from you has been received by us since what came by captain wickes till now by the arrival of the amphitrite and that the seeming uncertainty of your public affairs has prevented hitherto our obtaining the loan proposed <\s>

<s> gentlemen in a former letter we acquainted you that we had engaged an officer one of the most skilful in naval affairs this country possessed to build us a frigate in holland on a new construction drafts of which we sent you and to go over in her to america and enter your service <\s>

<s> in these vessels are clothes ready made for thirty thousand men besides arms cloths linens and naval stores to a great amount bought up by us and mr ross <\s>

<s> gentlemen in a former letter we acquainted you that we had engaged an officer one of the most skilful in naval affairs this country possessed to build us a frigate in holland on a new construction drafts of which we sent you and to go over in her to america and enter your service <\s>
<s> the frigate is almost finished <\s>
<s> she is very large is to carry thirty 24 pounders on one deck and is supposed equal to a ship of the line <\s>
<s> but the infinite difficulties we find in equipping and manning such a ship in any neutral port under the restrictions of treaties together with the want of supplies from you have induced us to sell her to the king who by a large pension offered to our officer has engaged him to remain in his service and pays us what we have expended on her <\s>
<s> we have built a small frigate at nantes which we hope to get away soon laden with supplies of various sorts <\s>
<s> we meet with difficulties too in shipping arms and ammunition in her but hope they will be surmounted <\s>
<s> several other vessels some under the direction of mr ross others belonging to french merchants are almost ready to sail for america and we had thoughts of sending them in a little fleet under convoy of the raleigh and alfred but on consultation considering the spies maintained by england in all the ports and thence the impossibility of making up such a fleet without its being known so as to give time for a superior force to be in wait for it we concluded the chance better of their going off singly as they should be ready <\s>
<s> in these vessels are clothes ready made for thirty thousand men besides arms cloths linens and naval stores to a great amount bought up by us and mr ross <\s>
<s> the private adventures will also be very considerable <\s>
<s> and as we shall continue our endeavor to complete your orders we hope that if the ships have common success in passing you will be better provided for the next campaign than you have been for any of the preceding <\s>
<s> how we are enabled to make these supplies must be a matter of some surprise to you when you reflect that little or nothing from you has been received by us since what came by captain wickes till now by the arrival of the amphitrite and that the seeming uncertainty of your public affairs has prevented hitherto our obtaining the loan proposed <\s>
<s> we have however found or made some friends who have helped and will we are confident continue to help us <\s>
<s> being anxious for supporting the credit of congress paper money we procured a fund for payment of the interest of all the congress had proposed to borrow <\s>
<s> and we mentioned in several of our letters that we should be ready to pay all bills drawn for the discharge of such interest to the full value in money of france that is five livres for every dollar of interest due <\s>
<s> we were persuaded that thus fixing the value of the interest would fix the value of the principal and consequently of the whole mass <\s>
<s> we hope this will be approved though we have yet no answer <\s>
<s> we cannot apply that fund to any other purpose and therefore wish to know as soon as may be the resolution of congress upon it <\s>
<s> possibly none of those letters had reached you or your answers have miscarried for the interruptions of our correspondence have been very considerable <\s>

<s> from holland they complain of the taking of the sloop chester captain bray belonging to rotterdam by two privateers of charleston called the fair american and the experiment from cadiz of the taking the french ship fortune captain kenguen by the _civil usage privateer having on board spanish property and here of the taking the emperor of germany from cork with beef belonging to the marine of france just off the mouth of bordeaux river <\s>
<s> we send herewith the papers we have received and answers given relating to those captures and we earnestly request that if upon fair trials it shall appear that the allegations are true speedy justice may be done and restitution made to the reclaimants it being of the utmost consequence to our affairs in europe that we should wipe off the aspersions of our enemies who proclaim us every where as pirates and endeavor to excite all the world against us <\s>

<s> in consequence of this embarrassed conduct our prizes cannot be sold publicly of which the purchasers take advantage in beating down the price and sometimes the admiralty courts are obliged to lay hold of them in consequence of orders from court obtained by the english ambassador <\s>
<s> our people of course complain of this as unfriendly treatment and as we must not counteract the court in the appearances they seem inclined to put on towards england we cannot set our folks right by acquainting them with the essential services our cause is continually receiving from this nation and we are apprehensive that resentment of that supposed unkind usage may induce some of them to make reprisals and thereby occasion a deal of mischief <\s>
<s> you will see some reason for this apprehension in the letter 45 from captain babson which we send you herewith relating to their two prizes confiscated here for false entries and afterwards delivered up to the british for which however we have hopes of obtaining full satisfaction having already a promise of part <\s>

<s> you will see by the papers and a letter of intelligence from london that the continuance of the war is warmly condemned in parliament by their wisest and best men in the debates on the speech but the old corrupt majority continues to vote as usual with the ministers <\s>

<s> whatever may be the clamor excited by discontent we think that a candid consideration of our circumstances and what congress have really done will fully justify them in the eyes of reasonable men <\s>
<s> we will observe in the first place that of all those who have returned not one came here at the request of congress that they have cost the states a very large sum of money and that the circumstances of affairs would not permit any benefit to be drawn from them here <\s>
<s> it was necessary previous to the opening of the campaign that the affairs of the army should be arranged officers appointed and every thing systematically made ready for the serious business that was approaching <\s>
<s> at this time it was not known by congress or the commander in chief that such a character as mons <\s>
<s> coudray under such agreements as he brought over with him was to visit us <\s>
<s> the best that could be done was therefore undertaken and general knox the father of the american artillery was appointed to that command and all the other divisions of the army were filled with major generals <\s>
<s> in this state of things arrived general du coudray with an agreement by which he was to command the artillery and the greatest part of the major generals of the army by being of older commission <\s>
<s> a plentiful crop of resignations began presently to sprout up and the whole army must have been deranged and thrown into confusion just in the opening of a campaign or this agreement not accorded to in the whole <\s>
<s> du coudray would have every thing or nothing <\s>
<s> an inflexible ambition that paid no regard to the situation and circumstances of the army would be gratified <\s>
<s> this produced a scene of contention which was not ended when the unfortunate general was drowned in the schuylkill going to join the army <\s>
<s> immediately on his death the rest of his corps would return to france and in this disposition congress endeavored to render things as agreeable to them as possible having some regard to the interest of the public which they serve <\s>
<s> it is very true that a concurrence of causes such as the removal from philadelphia the time that elapsed before business was gone regularly into again and the multiplicity of public affairs did occasion some delay in settling with these gentlemen but this was a loss to the community more than to them because their pay was continued to the last <\s>
<s> and you will see by the papers enclosed that ample allowances have been made for their expenses to the shipping port for passage to france and travel to paris <\s>

<s> if the campaign should close at this period and if it does it will be for want of clothes and blankets for both of which we are in great distress having received very few the enemy will have little to boast of <\s>

<s> it would have been otherwise had our young troops possessed that calmness of discipline and self recollection which is habitual to veteran armies <\s>
<s> the acquisition of philadelphia which mr howe holds at present by a very precarious tenure cannot have cost him in the whole fewer than four thousand men since they landed at the head of elk and we know they have lost two ships of war before fort mifflin one a sixtyfour gun ship the other a frigate <\s>

<s> gentlemen in a former letter we acquainted you that we had engaged an officer one of the most skilful in naval affairs this country possessed to build us a frigate in holland on a new construction drafts of which we sent you and to go over in her to america and enter your service <\s>
<s> the frigate is almost finished <\s>
<s> she is very large is to carry thirty 24 pounders on one deck and is supposed equal to a ship of the line <\s>
<s> but the infinite difficulties we find in equipping and manning such a ship in any neutral port under the restrictions of treaties together with the want of supplies from you have induced us to sell her to the king who by a large pension offered to our officer has engaged him to remain in his service and pays us what we have expended on her <\s>
<s> we have built a small frigate at nantes which we hope to get away soon laden with supplies of various sorts <\s>
<s> we meet with difficulties too in shipping arms and ammunition in her but hope they will be surmounted <\s>
<s> several other vessels some under the direction of mr ross others belonging to french merchants are almost ready to sail for america and we had thoughts of sending them in a little fleet under convoy of the raleigh and alfred but on consultation considering the spies maintained by england in all the ports and thence the impossibility of making up such a fleet without its being known so as to give time for a superior force to be in wait for it we concluded the chance better of their going off singly as they should be ready <\s>
<s> in these vessels are clothes ready made for thirty thousand men besides arms cloths linens and naval stores to a great amount bought up by us and mr ross <\s>
<s> the private adventures will also be very considerable <\s>
<s> and as we shall continue our endeavor to complete your orders we hope that if the ships have common success in passing you will be better provided for the next campaign than you have been for any of the preceding <\s>
<s> how we are enabled to make these supplies must be a matter of some surprise to you when you reflect that little or nothing from you has been received by us since what came by captain wickes till now by the arrival of the amphitrite and that the seeming uncertainty of your public affairs has prevented hitherto our obtaining the loan proposed <\s>
<s> we have however found or made some friends who have helped and will we are confident continue to help us <\s>
<s> being anxious for supporting the credit of congress paper money we procured a fund for payment of the interest of all the congress had proposed to borrow <\s>
<s> and we mentioned in several of our letters that we should be ready to pay all bills drawn for the discharge of such interest to the full value in money of france that is five livres for every dollar of interest due <\s>
<s> we were persuaded that thus fixing the value of the interest would fix the value of the principal and consequently of the whole mass <\s>
<s> we hope this will be approved though we have yet no answer <\s>
<s> we cannot apply that fund to any other purpose and therefore wish to know as soon as may be the resolution of congress upon it <\s>
<s> possibly none of those letters had reached you or your answers have miscarried for the interruptions of our correspondence have been very considerable <\s>
<s> adams by whom we wrote early this summer was taken on this coast having sunk his despatches <\s>
<s> we hear that hammond shared the same fate on your coast <\s>
<s> johnson by whom we wrote in september was taken going out of the channel and poor captain wickes who sailed at the same time and had duplicates we just now hear foundered near newfoundland every man perishing but the cook <\s>
<s> this loss is extremely to be lamented as he was a gallant officer and a very worthy man <\s>
<s> your despatches also which were coming by a small sloop from morris's river and by the _mere bobie packet were both sunk on those vessels being boarded by english men of war <\s>
<s> the amphitrite's arrival with a cargo of rice and indigo near one thousand barrels of the one and twenty of the other is a seasonable supply to us for our support we not having for some time past as you will see by our former letters any expectations of further supplies from mr morris and though we live here with as much frugality as possible the unavoidable expenses and the continual demands upon us for assistance to americans who escape from english prisons c <\s>
<s> endangered our being brought to great difficulties for subsistence <\s>
<s> the freight of that ship too calls for an enormous sum on account of her long demurrage <\s>
<s> we begin to be much troubled with complaints of our armed vessels taking the ships and merchandise of neutral nations <\s>
<s> from holland they complain of the taking of the sloop chester captain bray belonging to rotterdam by two privateers of charleston called the fair american and the experiment from cadiz of the taking the french ship fortune captain kenguen by the _civil usage privateer having on board spanish property and here of the taking the emperor of germany from cork with beef belonging to the marine of france just off the mouth of bordeaux river <\s>
<s> we send herewith the papers we have received and answers given relating to those captures and we earnestly request that if upon fair trials it shall appear that the allegations are true speedy justice may be done and restitution made to the reclaimants it being of the utmost consequence to our affairs in europe that we should wipe off the aspersions of our enemies who proclaim us every where as pirates and endeavor to excite all the world against us <\s>
<s> the spanish affair has already had very ill effects at that court as we learn by the return of the courier mentioned in our last <\s>
<s> we have by letters to our correspondents at the several ports done all in our power to prevent such mischiefs for the future a copy of which we herewith send you <\s>
<s> the european maritime powers embarrass themselves as well as us by the double part their politics oblige them to act being in their hearts our friends and wishing us success they would allow us every use of their ports consistent with their treaties or that we can make of them without giving open cause of complaint to england and it being so difficult to keep our privateers within those bounds we submit it to consideration whether it would not be better to forbear cruising on their coasts and bringing prizes in here till an open war takes place which though by no means certain seems every now and then to be apprehended on both sides witness among other circumstances the recall of their fishing ships by france and the king of england's late speech <\s>

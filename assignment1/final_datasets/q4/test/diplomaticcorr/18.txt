<s> gentlemen although we have not written to you directly for some time you may be assured we have not been unmindful of your interests your comfort or your liberty <\s>
<s> we have been engaged a long time in negotiating a cartel of exchange <\s>
<s> this work we found attended with many difficulties but at last have obtained assurances from england that an exchange shall take place <\s>
<s> we have also obtained from the government of this kingdom a passport for a vessel to come from england to nantes or l'orient with american prisoners there to take in british prisoners in exchange <\s>
<s> we now sincerely hope that you will obtain your liberty <\s>
<s> we cannot certainly say however that all will be immediately exchanged because we fear we have not an equal number to be sent to england <\s>
<s> those that remain if any will be those who have been the latest in captivity and consequently have suffered the least <\s>
<s> while the british government refused to make any agreement of exchange the commissioners here never discouraged their countrymen from escaping from the prisons in england but on the contrary have lent several sums of money sufficient with great economy to bear their expenses to some seaport to such as have made their way hither <\s>
<s> but if the british government should honorably keep their agreement to make a regular exchange we shall not think it consistent with the honor of the united states to encourage such escapes or to give any assistance to such as shall escape <\s>
<s> such escapes hereafter would have a tendency to excite the british administration to depart from the cartel to treat the prisoners remaining with more rigor and to punish those that escape if retaken with more severity <\s>
<s> on the other hand we have now obtained permission of this government to put all british prisoners whether taken by continental frigates or by privateers into the king's prisons and we are determined to treat such prisoners precisely as our countrymen are treated in england to give them the same allowance of provisions and accommodations and no other <\s>

<s> it is not the province of the government to examine them that matter comes under the jurisdiction of the courts if their sentence should be unfavorable to the original owners you will certainly agree that a third or even a half of the value of the vessel ought to be deposited in the hands of a public officer appointed for that purpose until the two nations shall agree upon some reciprocal regulations concerning vessels recaptured from the common enemy <\s>

<s> the transit regularly gives occasion for a duty on the importation and a second on the exportation only one of these shall be imposed it shall be paid at the office of entry the effects shall be estimated at a very moderate rate if they are not new they shall then be transported with free permits and under seal to secure them from new examinations on the route until they leave the kingdom <\s>
<s> i think you will agree that it would not be possible to grant them more favorable terms <\s>

<s> gentlemen although we have not written to you directly for some time you may be assured we have not been unmindful of your interests your comfort or your liberty <\s>
<s> we have been engaged a long time in negotiating a cartel of exchange <\s>
<s> this work we found attended with many difficulties but at last have obtained assurances from england that an exchange shall take place <\s>
<s> we have also obtained from the government of this kingdom a passport for a vessel to come from england to nantes or l'orient with american prisoners there to take in british prisoners in exchange <\s>
<s> we now sincerely hope that you will obtain your liberty <\s>
<s> we cannot certainly say however that all will be immediately exchanged because we fear we have not an equal number to be sent to england <\s>
<s> those that remain if any will be those who have been the latest in captivity and consequently have suffered the least <\s>
<s> while the british government refused to make any agreement of exchange the commissioners here never discouraged their countrymen from escaping from the prisons in england but on the contrary have lent several sums of money sufficient with great economy to bear their expenses to some seaport to such as have made their way hither <\s>
<s> but if the british government should honorably keep their agreement to make a regular exchange we shall not think it consistent with the honor of the united states to encourage such escapes or to give any assistance to such as shall escape <\s>
<s> such escapes hereafter would have a tendency to excite the british administration to depart from the cartel to treat the prisoners remaining with more rigor and to punish those that escape if retaken with more severity <\s>
<s> on the other hand we have now obtained permission of this government to put all british prisoners whether taken by continental frigates or by privateers into the king's prisons and we are determined to treat such prisoners precisely as our countrymen are treated in england to give them the same allowance of provisions and accommodations and no other <\s>
<s> we therefore request you to inform us with exactness what your allowance is from the government that we may govern ourselves accordingly <\s>

<s> i am sorry that you have not at hand a copy of the laws of the united states relative to this subject <\s>
<s> many difficulties which the distance of the two countries may render very frequent might thus have been prevented <\s>
<s> the laws of massachusetts bay referred to by captain m'neil are different from those of england and somewhat resemble the french <\s>
<s> the english regulations seem to be more favorable to the interests of commerce which should never be lost sight of even in war by allowing half of the vessel in all cases to the original owner <\s>
<s> but it is particularly important that the different states should adopt some uniform and permanent system in regard to this subject so that there may not be different regulations for each state which the ignorance of the commanders of privateers will prevent them from applying to different circumstances thus giving rise to difficulties which might be avoided by uniform legislation <\s>
<s> with regard to the recapture of the isabella by captain m'neil i have merely indicated to you the grounds on which the owners rested their claims in their letter to me <\s>
<s> it is not the province of the government to examine them that matter comes under the jurisdiction of the courts if their sentence should be unfavorable to the original owners you will certainly agree that a third or even a half of the value of the vessel ought to be deposited in the hands of a public officer appointed for that purpose until the two nations shall agree upon some reciprocal regulations concerning vessels recaptured from the common enemy <\s>

<s> subjects and citizens it is true are forbidden by most civilized nations to arm vessels for cruising against their enemies without a commission from the sovereign but it is upon penalty of confiscation or some other perhaps milder punishment not on the penalties of piracy <\s>

<s> gentlemen although we have not written to you directly for some time you may be assured we have not been unmindful of your interests your comfort or your liberty <\s>
<s> we have been engaged a long time in negotiating a cartel of exchange <\s>
<s> this work we found attended with many difficulties but at last have obtained assurances from england that an exchange shall take place <\s>
<s> we have also obtained from the government of this kingdom a passport for a vessel to come from england to nantes or l'orient with american prisoners there to take in british prisoners in exchange <\s>
<s> we now sincerely hope that you will obtain your liberty <\s>
<s> we cannot certainly say however that all will be immediately exchanged because we fear we have not an equal number to be sent to england <\s>
<s> those that remain if any will be those who have been the latest in captivity and consequently have suffered the least <\s>
<s> while the british government refused to make any agreement of exchange the commissioners here never discouraged their countrymen from escaping from the prisons in england but on the contrary have lent several sums of money sufficient with great economy to bear their expenses to some seaport to such as have made their way hither <\s>
<s> but if the british government should honorably keep their agreement to make a regular exchange we shall not think it consistent with the honor of the united states to encourage such escapes or to give any assistance to such as shall escape <\s>
<s> such escapes hereafter would have a tendency to excite the british administration to depart from the cartel to treat the prisoners remaining with more rigor and to punish those that escape if retaken with more severity <\s>
<s> on the other hand we have now obtained permission of this government to put all british prisoners whether taken by continental frigates or by privateers into the king's prisons and we are determined to treat such prisoners precisely as our countrymen are treated in england to give them the same allowance of provisions and accommodations and no other <\s>

<s> it is not the province of the government to examine them that matter comes under the jurisdiction of the courts if their sentence should be unfavorable to the original owners you will certainly agree that a third or even a half of the value of the vessel ought to be deposited in the hands of a public officer appointed for that purpose until the two nations shall agree upon some reciprocal regulations concerning vessels recaptured from the common enemy <\s>

<s> gentlemen although we have not written to you directly for some time you may be assured we have not been unmindful of your interests your comfort or your liberty <\s>
<s> we have been engaged a long time in negotiating a cartel of exchange <\s>
<s> this work we found attended with many difficulties but at last have obtained assurances from england that an exchange shall take place <\s>
<s> we have also obtained from the government of this kingdom a passport for a vessel to come from england to nantes or l'orient with american prisoners there to take in british prisoners in exchange <\s>
<s> we now sincerely hope that you will obtain your liberty <\s>
<s> we cannot certainly say however that all will be immediately exchanged because we fear we have not an equal number to be sent to england <\s>
<s> those that remain if any will be those who have been the latest in captivity and consequently have suffered the least <\s>
<s> while the british government refused to make any agreement of exchange the commissioners here never discouraged their countrymen from escaping from the prisons in england but on the contrary have lent several sums of money sufficient with great economy to bear their expenses to some seaport to such as have made their way hither <\s>
<s> but if the british government should honorably keep their agreement to make a regular exchange we shall not think it consistent with the honor of the united states to encourage such escapes or to give any assistance to such as shall escape <\s>
<s> such escapes hereafter would have a tendency to excite the british administration to depart from the cartel to treat the prisoners remaining with more rigor and to punish those that escape if retaken with more severity <\s>
<s> on the other hand we have now obtained permission of this government to put all british prisoners whether taken by continental frigates or by privateers into the king's prisons and we are determined to treat such prisoners precisely as our countrymen are treated in england to give them the same allowance of provisions and accommodations and no other <\s>

<s> i am sorry that you have not at hand a copy of the laws of the united states relative to this subject <\s>
<s> many difficulties which the distance of the two countries may render very frequent might thus have been prevented <\s>
<s> the laws of massachusetts bay referred to by captain m'neil are different from those of england and somewhat resemble the french <\s>
<s> the english regulations seem to be more favorable to the interests of commerce which should never be lost sight of even in war by allowing half of the vessel in all cases to the original owner <\s>
<s> but it is particularly important that the different states should adopt some uniform and permanent system in regard to this subject so that there may not be different regulations for each state which the ignorance of the commanders of privateers will prevent them from applying to different circumstances thus giving rise to difficulties which might be avoided by uniform legislation <\s>
<s> with regard to the recapture of the isabella by captain m'neil i have merely indicated to you the grounds on which the owners rested their claims in their letter to me <\s>
<s> it is not the province of the government to examine them that matter comes under the jurisdiction of the courts if their sentence should be unfavorable to the original owners you will certainly agree that a third or even a half of the value of the vessel ought to be deposited in the hands of a public officer appointed for that purpose until the two nations shall agree upon some reciprocal regulations concerning vessels recaptured from the common enemy <\s>

<s> subjects and citizens it is true are forbidden by most civilized nations to arm vessels for cruising against their enemies without a commission from the sovereign but it is upon penalty of confiscation or some other perhaps milder punishment not on the penalties of piracy <\s>

<s> gentlemen although we have not written to you directly for some time you may be assured we have not been unmindful of your interests your comfort or your liberty <\s>
<s> we have been engaged a long time in negotiating a cartel of exchange <\s>
<s> this work we found attended with many difficulties but at last have obtained assurances from england that an exchange shall take place <\s>
<s> we have also obtained from the government of this kingdom a passport for a vessel to come from england to nantes or l'orient with american prisoners there to take in british prisoners in exchange <\s>
<s> we now sincerely hope that you will obtain your liberty <\s>
<s> we cannot certainly say however that all will be immediately exchanged because we fear we have not an equal number to be sent to england <\s>
<s> those that remain if any will be those who have been the latest in captivity and consequently have suffered the least <\s>
<s> while the british government refused to make any agreement of exchange the commissioners here never discouraged their countrymen from escaping from the prisons in england but on the contrary have lent several sums of money sufficient with great economy to bear their expenses to some seaport to such as have made their way hither <\s>
<s> but if the british government should honorably keep their agreement to make a regular exchange we shall not think it consistent with the honor of the united states to encourage such escapes or to give any assistance to such as shall escape <\s>
<s> such escapes hereafter would have a tendency to excite the british administration to depart from the cartel to treat the prisoners remaining with more rigor and to punish those that escape if retaken with more severity <\s>
<s> on the other hand we have now obtained permission of this government to put all british prisoners whether taken by continental frigates or by privateers into the king's prisons and we are determined to treat such prisoners precisely as our countrymen are treated in england to give them the same allowance of provisions and accommodations and no other <\s>

<s> it is not the province of the government to examine them that matter comes under the jurisdiction of the courts if their sentence should be unfavorable to the original owners you will certainly agree that a third or even a half of the value of the vessel ought to be deposited in the hands of a public officer appointed for that purpose until the two nations shall agree upon some reciprocal regulations concerning vessels recaptured from the common enemy <\s>

<s> gentlemen although we have not written to you directly for some time you may be assured we have not been unmindful of your interests your comfort or your liberty <\s>
<s> we have been engaged a long time in negotiating a cartel of exchange <\s>
<s> this work we found attended with many difficulties but at last have obtained assurances from england that an exchange shall take place <\s>
<s> we have also obtained from the government of this kingdom a passport for a vessel to come from england to nantes or l'orient with american prisoners there to take in british prisoners in exchange <\s>
<s> we now sincerely hope that you will obtain your liberty <\s>
<s> we cannot certainly say however that all will be immediately exchanged because we fear we have not an equal number to be sent to england <\s>
<s> those that remain if any will be those who have been the latest in captivity and consequently have suffered the least <\s>
<s> while the british government refused to make any agreement of exchange the commissioners here never discouraged their countrymen from escaping from the prisons in england but on the contrary have lent several sums of money sufficient with great economy to bear their expenses to some seaport to such as have made their way hither <\s>
<s> but if the british government should honorably keep their agreement to make a regular exchange we shall not think it consistent with the honor of the united states to encourage such escapes or to give any assistance to such as shall escape <\s>
<s> such escapes hereafter would have a tendency to excite the british administration to depart from the cartel to treat the prisoners remaining with more rigor and to punish those that escape if retaken with more severity <\s>
<s> on the other hand we have now obtained permission of this government to put all british prisoners whether taken by continental frigates or by privateers into the king's prisons and we are determined to treat such prisoners precisely as our countrymen are treated in england to give them the same allowance of provisions and accommodations and no other <\s>

<s> i am sorry that you have not at hand a copy of the laws of the united states relative to this subject <\s>
<s> many difficulties which the distance of the two countries may render very frequent might thus have been prevented <\s>
<s> the laws of massachusetts bay referred to by captain m'neil are different from those of england and somewhat resemble the french <\s>
<s> the english regulations seem to be more favorable to the interests of commerce which should never be lost sight of even in war by allowing half of the vessel in all cases to the original owner <\s>
<s> but it is particularly important that the different states should adopt some uniform and permanent system in regard to this subject so that there may not be different regulations for each state which the ignorance of the commanders of privateers will prevent them from applying to different circumstances thus giving rise to difficulties which might be avoided by uniform legislation <\s>
<s> with regard to the recapture of the isabella by captain m'neil i have merely indicated to you the grounds on which the owners rested their claims in their letter to me <\s>
<s> it is not the province of the government to examine them that matter comes under the jurisdiction of the courts if their sentence should be unfavorable to the original owners you will certainly agree that a third or even a half of the value of the vessel ought to be deposited in the hands of a public officer appointed for that purpose until the two nations shall agree upon some reciprocal regulations concerning vessels recaptured from the common enemy <\s>

<s> subjects and citizens it is true are forbidden by most civilized nations to arm vessels for cruising against their enemies without a commission from the sovereign but it is upon penalty of confiscation or some other perhaps milder punishment not on the penalties of piracy <\s>

<s> gentlemen although we have not written to you directly for some time you may be assured we have not been unmindful of your interests your comfort or your liberty <\s>
<s> we have been engaged a long time in negotiating a cartel of exchange <\s>
<s> this work we found attended with many difficulties but at last have obtained assurances from england that an exchange shall take place <\s>
<s> we have also obtained from the government of this kingdom a passport for a vessel to come from england to nantes or l'orient with american prisoners there to take in british prisoners in exchange <\s>
<s> we now sincerely hope that you will obtain your liberty <\s>
<s> we cannot certainly say however that all will be immediately exchanged because we fear we have not an equal number to be sent to england <\s>
<s> those that remain if any will be those who have been the latest in captivity and consequently have suffered the least <\s>
<s> while the british government refused to make any agreement of exchange the commissioners here never discouraged their countrymen from escaping from the prisons in england but on the contrary have lent several sums of money sufficient with great economy to bear their expenses to some seaport to such as have made their way hither <\s>
<s> but if the british government should honorably keep their agreement to make a regular exchange we shall not think it consistent with the honor of the united states to encourage such escapes or to give any assistance to such as shall escape <\s>
<s> such escapes hereafter would have a tendency to excite the british administration to depart from the cartel to treat the prisoners remaining with more rigor and to punish those that escape if retaken with more severity <\s>
<s> on the other hand we have now obtained permission of this government to put all british prisoners whether taken by continental frigates or by privateers into the king's prisons and we are determined to treat such prisoners precisely as our countrymen are treated in england to give them the same allowance of provisions and accommodations and no other <\s>

<s> it is not the province of the government to examine them that matter comes under the jurisdiction of the courts if their sentence should be unfavorable to the original owners you will certainly agree that a third or even a half of the value of the vessel ought to be deposited in the hands of a public officer appointed for that purpose until the two nations shall agree upon some reciprocal regulations concerning vessels recaptured from the common enemy <\s>

<s> gentlemen although we have not written to you directly for some time you may be assured we have not been unmindful of your interests your comfort or your liberty <\s>
<s> we have been engaged a long time in negotiating a cartel of exchange <\s>
<s> this work we found attended with many difficulties but at last have obtained assurances from england that an exchange shall take place <\s>
<s> we have also obtained from the government of this kingdom a passport for a vessel to come from england to nantes or l'orient with american prisoners there to take in british prisoners in exchange <\s>
<s> we now sincerely hope that you will obtain your liberty <\s>
<s> we cannot certainly say however that all will be immediately exchanged because we fear we have not an equal number to be sent to england <\s>
<s> those that remain if any will be those who have been the latest in captivity and consequently have suffered the least <\s>
<s> while the british government refused to make any agreement of exchange the commissioners here never discouraged their countrymen from escaping from the prisons in england but on the contrary have lent several sums of money sufficient with great economy to bear their expenses to some seaport to such as have made their way hither <\s>
<s> but if the british government should honorably keep their agreement to make a regular exchange we shall not think it consistent with the honor of the united states to encourage such escapes or to give any assistance to such as shall escape <\s>
<s> such escapes hereafter would have a tendency to excite the british administration to depart from the cartel to treat the prisoners remaining with more rigor and to punish those that escape if retaken with more severity <\s>
<s> on the other hand we have now obtained permission of this government to put all british prisoners whether taken by continental frigates or by privateers into the king's prisons and we are determined to treat such prisoners precisely as our countrymen are treated in england to give them the same allowance of provisions and accommodations and no other <\s>

<s> i am sorry that you have not at hand a copy of the laws of the united states relative to this subject <\s>
<s> many difficulties which the distance of the two countries may render very frequent might thus have been prevented <\s>
<s> the laws of massachusetts bay referred to by captain m'neil are different from those of england and somewhat resemble the french <\s>
<s> the english regulations seem to be more favorable to the interests of commerce which should never be lost sight of even in war by allowing half of the vessel in all cases to the original owner <\s>
<s> but it is particularly important that the different states should adopt some uniform and permanent system in regard to this subject so that there may not be different regulations for each state which the ignorance of the commanders of privateers will prevent them from applying to different circumstances thus giving rise to difficulties which might be avoided by uniform legislation <\s>
<s> with regard to the recapture of the isabella by captain m'neil i have merely indicated to you the grounds on which the owners rested their claims in their letter to me <\s>
<s> it is not the province of the government to examine them that matter comes under the jurisdiction of the courts if their sentence should be unfavorable to the original owners you will certainly agree that a third or even a half of the value of the vessel ought to be deposited in the hands of a public officer appointed for that purpose until the two nations shall agree upon some reciprocal regulations concerning vessels recaptured from the common enemy <\s>

<s> subjects and citizens it is true are forbidden by most civilized nations to arm vessels for cruising against their enemies without a commission from the sovereign but it is upon penalty of confiscation or some other perhaps milder punishment not on the penalties of piracy <\s>

<s> gentlemen although we have not written to you directly for some time you may be assured we have not been unmindful of your interests your comfort or your liberty <\s>
<s> we have been engaged a long time in negotiating a cartel of exchange <\s>
<s> this work we found attended with many difficulties but at last have obtained assurances from england that an exchange shall take place <\s>
<s> we have also obtained from the government of this kingdom a passport for a vessel to come from england to nantes or l'orient with american prisoners there to take in british prisoners in exchange <\s>
<s> we now sincerely hope that you will obtain your liberty <\s>
<s> we cannot certainly say however that all will be immediately exchanged because we fear we have not an equal number to be sent to england <\s>
<s> those that remain if any will be those who have been the latest in captivity and consequently have suffered the least <\s>
<s> while the british government refused to make any agreement of exchange the commissioners here never discouraged their countrymen from escaping from the prisons in england but on the contrary have lent several sums of money sufficient with great economy to bear their expenses to some seaport to such as have made their way hither <\s>
<s> but if the british government should honorably keep their agreement to make a regular exchange we shall not think it consistent with the honor of the united states to encourage such escapes or to give any assistance to such as shall escape <\s>
<s> such escapes hereafter would have a tendency to excite the british administration to depart from the cartel to treat the prisoners remaining with more rigor and to punish those that escape if retaken with more severity <\s>
<s> on the other hand we have now obtained permission of this government to put all british prisoners whether taken by continental frigates or by privateers into the king's prisons and we are determined to treat such prisoners precisely as our countrymen are treated in england to give them the same allowance of provisions and accommodations and no other <\s>

<s> it is not the province of the government to examine them that matter comes under the jurisdiction of the courts if their sentence should be unfavorable to the original owners you will certainly agree that a third or even a half of the value of the vessel ought to be deposited in the hands of a public officer appointed for that purpose until the two nations shall agree upon some reciprocal regulations concerning vessels recaptured from the common enemy <\s>

<s> gentlemen although we have not written to you directly for some time you may be assured we have not been unmindful of your interests your comfort or your liberty <\s>
<s> we have been engaged a long time in negotiating a cartel of exchange <\s>
<s> this work we found attended with many difficulties but at last have obtained assurances from england that an exchange shall take place <\s>
<s> we have also obtained from the government of this kingdom a passport for a vessel to come from england to nantes or l'orient with american prisoners there to take in british prisoners in exchange <\s>
<s> we now sincerely hope that you will obtain your liberty <\s>
<s> we cannot certainly say however that all will be immediately exchanged because we fear we have not an equal number to be sent to england <\s>
<s> those that remain if any will be those who have been the latest in captivity and consequently have suffered the least <\s>
<s> while the british government refused to make any agreement of exchange the commissioners here never discouraged their countrymen from escaping from the prisons in england but on the contrary have lent several sums of money sufficient with great economy to bear their expenses to some seaport to such as have made their way hither <\s>
<s> but if the british government should honorably keep their agreement to make a regular exchange we shall not think it consistent with the honor of the united states to encourage such escapes or to give any assistance to such as shall escape <\s>
<s> such escapes hereafter would have a tendency to excite the british administration to depart from the cartel to treat the prisoners remaining with more rigor and to punish those that escape if retaken with more severity <\s>
<s> on the other hand we have now obtained permission of this government to put all british prisoners whether taken by continental frigates or by privateers into the king's prisons and we are determined to treat such prisoners precisely as our countrymen are treated in england to give them the same allowance of provisions and accommodations and no other <\s>

<s> i am sorry that you have not at hand a copy of the laws of the united states relative to this subject <\s>
<s> many difficulties which the distance of the two countries may render very frequent might thus have been prevented <\s>
<s> the laws of massachusetts bay referred to by captain m'neil are different from those of england and somewhat resemble the french <\s>
<s> the english regulations seem to be more favorable to the interests of commerce which should never be lost sight of even in war by allowing half of the vessel in all cases to the original owner <\s>
<s> but it is particularly important that the different states should adopt some uniform and permanent system in regard to this subject so that there may not be different regulations for each state which the ignorance of the commanders of privateers will prevent them from applying to different circumstances thus giving rise to difficulties which might be avoided by uniform legislation <\s>
<s> with regard to the recapture of the isabella by captain m'neil i have merely indicated to you the grounds on which the owners rested their claims in their letter to me <\s>
<s> it is not the province of the government to examine them that matter comes under the jurisdiction of the courts if their sentence should be unfavorable to the original owners you will certainly agree that a third or even a half of the value of the vessel ought to be deposited in the hands of a public officer appointed for that purpose until the two nations shall agree upon some reciprocal regulations concerning vessels recaptured from the common enemy <\s>

<s> subjects and citizens it is true are forbidden by most civilized nations to arm vessels for cruising against their enemies without a commission from the sovereign but it is upon penalty of confiscation or some other perhaps milder punishment not on the penalties of piracy <\s>

<s> gentlemen although we have not written to you directly for some time you may be assured we have not been unmindful of your interests your comfort or your liberty <\s>
<s> we have been engaged a long time in negotiating a cartel of exchange <\s>
<s> this work we found attended with many difficulties but at last have obtained assurances from england that an exchange shall take place <\s>
<s> we have also obtained from the government of this kingdom a passport for a vessel to come from england to nantes or l'orient with american prisoners there to take in british prisoners in exchange <\s>
<s> we now sincerely hope that you will obtain your liberty <\s>
<s> we cannot certainly say however that all will be immediately exchanged because we fear we have not an equal number to be sent to england <\s>
<s> those that remain if any will be those who have been the latest in captivity and consequently have suffered the least <\s>
<s> while the british government refused to make any agreement of exchange the commissioners here never discouraged their countrymen from escaping from the prisons in england but on the contrary have lent several sums of money sufficient with great economy to bear their expenses to some seaport to such as have made their way hither <\s>
<s> but if the british government should honorably keep their agreement to make a regular exchange we shall not think it consistent with the honor of the united states to encourage such escapes or to give any assistance to such as shall escape <\s>
<s> such escapes hereafter would have a tendency to excite the british administration to depart from the cartel to treat the prisoners remaining with more rigor and to punish those that escape if retaken with more severity <\s>
<s> on the other hand we have now obtained permission of this government to put all british prisoners whether taken by continental frigates or by privateers into the king's prisons and we are determined to treat such prisoners precisely as our countrymen are treated in england to give them the same allowance of provisions and accommodations and no other <\s>

<s> it is not the province of the government to examine them that matter comes under the jurisdiction of the courts if their sentence should be unfavorable to the original owners you will certainly agree that a third or even a half of the value of the vessel ought to be deposited in the hands of a public officer appointed for that purpose until the two nations shall agree upon some reciprocal regulations concerning vessels recaptured from the common enemy <\s>

<s> gentlemen although we have not written to you directly for some time you may be assured we have not been unmindful of your interests your comfort or your liberty <\s>
<s> we have been engaged a long time in negotiating a cartel of exchange <\s>
<s> this work we found attended with many difficulties but at last have obtained assurances from england that an exchange shall take place <\s>
<s> we have also obtained from the government of this kingdom a passport for a vessel to come from england to nantes or l'orient with american prisoners there to take in british prisoners in exchange <\s>
<s> we now sincerely hope that you will obtain your liberty <\s>
<s> we cannot certainly say however that all will be immediately exchanged because we fear we have not an equal number to be sent to england <\s>
<s> those that remain if any will be those who have been the latest in captivity and consequently have suffered the least <\s>
<s> while the british government refused to make any agreement of exchange the commissioners here never discouraged their countrymen from escaping from the prisons in england but on the contrary have lent several sums of money sufficient with great economy to bear their expenses to some seaport to such as have made their way hither <\s>
<s> but if the british government should honorably keep their agreement to make a regular exchange we shall not think it consistent with the honor of the united states to encourage such escapes or to give any assistance to such as shall escape <\s>
<s> such escapes hereafter would have a tendency to excite the british administration to depart from the cartel to treat the prisoners remaining with more rigor and to punish those that escape if retaken with more severity <\s>
<s> on the other hand we have now obtained permission of this government to put all british prisoners whether taken by continental frigates or by privateers into the king's prisons and we are determined to treat such prisoners precisely as our countrymen are treated in england to give them the same allowance of provisions and accommodations and no other <\s>

<s> i am sorry that you have not at hand a copy of the laws of the united states relative to this subject <\s>
<s> many difficulties which the distance of the two countries may render very frequent might thus have been prevented <\s>
<s> the laws of massachusetts bay referred to by captain m'neil are different from those of england and somewhat resemble the french <\s>
<s> the english regulations seem to be more favorable to the interests of commerce which should never be lost sight of even in war by allowing half of the vessel in all cases to the original owner <\s>
<s> but it is particularly important that the different states should adopt some uniform and permanent system in regard to this subject so that there may not be different regulations for each state which the ignorance of the commanders of privateers will prevent them from applying to different circumstances thus giving rise to difficulties which might be avoided by uniform legislation <\s>
<s> with regard to the recapture of the isabella by captain m'neil i have merely indicated to you the grounds on which the owners rested their claims in their letter to me <\s>
<s> it is not the province of the government to examine them that matter comes under the jurisdiction of the courts if their sentence should be unfavorable to the original owners you will certainly agree that a third or even a half of the value of the vessel ought to be deposited in the hands of a public officer appointed for that purpose until the two nations shall agree upon some reciprocal regulations concerning vessels recaptured from the common enemy <\s>

<s> subjects and citizens it is true are forbidden by most civilized nations to arm vessels for cruising against their enemies without a commission from the sovereign but it is upon penalty of confiscation or some other perhaps milder punishment not on the penalties of piracy <\s>

<s> gentlemen although we have not written to you directly for some time you may be assured we have not been unmindful of your interests your comfort or your liberty <\s>
<s> we have been engaged a long time in negotiating a cartel of exchange <\s>
<s> this work we found attended with many difficulties but at last have obtained assurances from england that an exchange shall take place <\s>
<s> we have also obtained from the government of this kingdom a passport for a vessel to come from england to nantes or l'orient with american prisoners there to take in british prisoners in exchange <\s>
<s> we now sincerely hope that you will obtain your liberty <\s>
<s> we cannot certainly say however that all will be immediately exchanged because we fear we have not an equal number to be sent to england <\s>
<s> those that remain if any will be those who have been the latest in captivity and consequently have suffered the least <\s>
<s> while the british government refused to make any agreement of exchange the commissioners here never discouraged their countrymen from escaping from the prisons in england but on the contrary have lent several sums of money sufficient with great economy to bear their expenses to some seaport to such as have made their way hither <\s>
<s> but if the british government should honorably keep their agreement to make a regular exchange we shall not think it consistent with the honor of the united states to encourage such escapes or to give any assistance to such as shall escape <\s>
<s> such escapes hereafter would have a tendency to excite the british administration to depart from the cartel to treat the prisoners remaining with more rigor and to punish those that escape if retaken with more severity <\s>
<s> on the other hand we have now obtained permission of this government to put all british prisoners whether taken by continental frigates or by privateers into the king's prisons and we are determined to treat such prisoners precisely as our countrymen are treated in england to give them the same allowance of provisions and accommodations and no other <\s>

<s> it is not the province of the government to examine them that matter comes under the jurisdiction of the courts if their sentence should be unfavorable to the original owners you will certainly agree that a third or even a half of the value of the vessel ought to be deposited in the hands of a public officer appointed for that purpose until the two nations shall agree upon some reciprocal regulations concerning vessels recaptured from the common enemy <\s>

<s> sir i conclude from your note of the 5th instant that the commissioners of the north american congress have informed you that there are many americans in england and other parts of europe who desirous of returning to their country have requested permission to transport their effects through france without being subjected to the payment of duties <\s>
<s> such an exemption would be contrary to all rule and could only be granted by means of passports which would indemnify the public chest you will doubtless see that such is not the case here <\s>
<s> this favor however can be shown them <\s>
<s> the transit regularly gives occasion for a duty on the importation and a second on the exportation only one of these shall be imposed it shall be paid at the office of entry the effects shall be estimated at a very moderate rate if they are not new they shall then be transported with free permits and under seal to secure them from new examinations on the route until they leave the kingdom <\s>
<s> i think you will agree that it would not be possible to grant them more favorable terms <\s>
<s> i beg you to request the commissioners to make known to us those americans for whom this favor is requested that i may give the necessary orders and prevent all abuses in this respect <\s>

<s> gentlemen although we have not written to you directly for some time you may be assured we have not been unmindful of your interests your comfort or your liberty <\s>
<s> we have been engaged a long time in negotiating a cartel of exchange <\s>
<s> this work we found attended with many difficulties but at last have obtained assurances from england that an exchange shall take place <\s>
<s> we have also obtained from the government of this kingdom a passport for a vessel to come from england to nantes or l'orient with american prisoners there to take in british prisoners in exchange <\s>
<s> we now sincerely hope that you will obtain your liberty <\s>
<s> we cannot certainly say however that all will be immediately exchanged because we fear we have not an equal number to be sent to england <\s>
<s> those that remain if any will be those who have been the latest in captivity and consequently have suffered the least <\s>
<s> while the british government refused to make any agreement of exchange the commissioners here never discouraged their countrymen from escaping from the prisons in england but on the contrary have lent several sums of money sufficient with great economy to bear their expenses to some seaport to such as have made their way hither <\s>
<s> but if the british government should honorably keep their agreement to make a regular exchange we shall not think it consistent with the honor of the united states to encourage such escapes or to give any assistance to such as shall escape <\s>
<s> such escapes hereafter would have a tendency to excite the british administration to depart from the cartel to treat the prisoners remaining with more rigor and to punish those that escape if retaken with more severity <\s>
<s> on the other hand we have now obtained permission of this government to put all british prisoners whether taken by continental frigates or by privateers into the king's prisons and we are determined to treat such prisoners precisely as our countrymen are treated in england to give them the same allowance of provisions and accommodations and no other <\s>
<s> we therefore request you to inform us with exactness what your allowance is from the government that we may govern ourselves accordingly <\s>

<s> gentlemen i have had the honor of receiving your note of the 17th instant <\s>
<s> i have no doubt that my observations on the necessity of a perfect reciprocity between the two nations in regard to recaptures at sea appear to you just <\s>
<s> i am sorry that you have not at hand a copy of the laws of the united states relative to this subject <\s>
<s> many difficulties which the distance of the two countries may render very frequent might thus have been prevented <\s>
<s> the laws of massachusetts bay referred to by captain m'neil are different from those of england and somewhat resemble the french <\s>
<s> the english regulations seem to be more favorable to the interests of commerce which should never be lost sight of even in war by allowing half of the vessel in all cases to the original owner <\s>
<s> but it is particularly important that the different states should adopt some uniform and permanent system in regard to this subject so that there may not be different regulations for each state which the ignorance of the commanders of privateers will prevent them from applying to different circumstances thus giving rise to difficulties which might be avoided by uniform legislation <\s>
<s> with regard to the recapture of the isabella by captain m'neil i have merely indicated to you the grounds on which the owners rested their claims in their letter to me <\s>
<s> it is not the province of the government to examine them that matter comes under the jurisdiction of the courts if their sentence should be unfavorable to the original owners you will certainly agree that a third or even a half of the value of the vessel ought to be deposited in the hands of a public officer appointed for that purpose until the two nations shall agree upon some reciprocal regulations concerning vessels recaptured from the common enemy <\s>

<s> it is not the want of a commission as we humbly conceive that makes a man guilty of piracy but committing hostilities against human kind at least against a nation not at war <\s>
<s> commissions are but one species of evidence that nations are at war <\s>
<s> but there are many other ways of proving the same thing <\s>
<s> subjects and citizens it is true are forbidden by most civilized nations to arm vessels for cruising against their enemies without a commission from the sovereign but it is upon penalty of confiscation or some other perhaps milder punishment not on the penalties of piracy <\s>
<s> moreover perhaps prizes made upon enemies by subjects or citizens without commission from their sovereigns may belong to the sovereigns not to the captors by the laws of most nations but perhaps no nation ever punished as pirates their own subjects or citizens for making a prize from an enemy without a commission <\s>

<s> passy 17th september 1778 <\s>
<s> sir the last letter which we have had the honor to write jointly to congress was of the 20th of july 52 and as we have sent several copies of it by different opportunities we hope one of them at least will get safe to hand <\s>
<s> since our last there has been an important action at sea between two very powerful fleets in which in our opinion the french had a manifest and great advantage <\s>
<s> but as all the newspapers in europe are full of this transaction and we have taken in our separate capacities every opportunity to transmit these papers to congress we think it needless to be more particular concerning that event in this letter <\s>
<s> the french fleet on the 11th of last month again put to sea and on the 22d admiral keppel sailed <\s>
<s> by the best intelligence from london the populace are amused and the public funds are supported by hopes given out by administration of peace by an acknowledgment of american independency <\s>
<s> but as the credulity of that nation has no bounds we can draw no inference from this general opinion that such is the intention of government <\s>
<s> we suppose that rumor to be a consequence of the mischievous determination of the cabinet to propose independence on condition of a separate peace <\s>
<s> we are here at this moment in a state of the most anxious and critical suspense having heard nothing from count d'estaing nor from america since the 11th of july <\s>
<s> congress will be informed by mr arthur lee respecting the court of spain <\s>
<s> we have taken measures in amsterdam for borrowing money of the dutch but what success we shall have we cannot yet say <\s>
<s> we have also asked leave of this government to borrow money in this kingdom but having no answer we cannot say whether we shall get permission or not <\s>
<s> we have yesterday applied for a continuation of the quarterly payment of seven hundred and fifty thousand livres what the answer will be we know not if it is in the negative the consequence must be plain to congress and to us <\s>
<s> it is at all times wisest and safest both for the representative and his constituent to be candid and we should think ourselves criminal if we should disguise our just apprehensions <\s>
<s> congress then will be pleased to be informed that all the powers of europe are now armed or arming themselves by land or sea or both as there seems to be a universal apprehension of a general war <\s>
<s> such is the situation of european nations at least that no one can arm itself without borrowing money <\s>
<s> besides this the emperor and king of prussia are at actual war <\s>
<s> all this together has produced this effect that france england the emperor spain russia at least are borrowing money and there is not one of them that we can learn but offers better interest than the united states have offered <\s>
<s> there can be no motive then but simple benevolence to lend to us <\s>
<s> applications have been frequently made to us by americans who have been some time abroad to administer the oath of allegiance to the united states and to give them certificates that they have taken such oaths <\s>
<s> in three instances we have yielded to their importunity in the case of mr moore of new jersey who has large property in the east indies which he designs to transfer immediately to america in the case of mr woodford of virginia a brother of general woodford who has been sometime in italy and means to return to america with his property and yesterday in the case of mr montgomery of philadelphia who is settled at alicant in spain but wishes to send vessels and cargoes of his own property to america <\s>
<s> we have given our opinions to these gentlemen frankly that such certificates are in strictness legally void because there is no act of congress that expressly gives us power to administer oaths <\s>
<s> we have also given two or three commissions by means of the blanks with which congress intrusted us one to mr livingston and one to mr amiel to be lieutenants in the navy and in these cases we have ventured to administer the oaths of allegiance <\s>
<s> we have also in one instance administered the oath of secrecy to one of our secretaries and perhaps it is necessary to administer such an oath as well as that of allegiance to all persons whom we may be obliged in the extensive correspondence we maintain to employ <\s>
<s> we hope we shall not have the disapprobation of congress for what in this way has been done but we wish for explicit powers and instructions upon this head <\s>
<s> there are among the multitude of americans who are scattered about the various parts of europe some we hope many who wish to take the oath of allegiance and to have some mode prescribed by which they may be enabled to send their vessels and cargoes to america with safety from their own friends american men of war and privateers <\s>

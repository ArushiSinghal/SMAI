<s> philadelphia 26th april 1779 <\s>
<s> sir as i have received no reply to my letters of the 30th ult <\s>
<s> and 2d instant i take the liberty of applying again to congress to remind them of my situation <\s>
<s> it is now more than twelve months since in obedience to their orders i left france to return to my native country <\s>
<s> having employed the short interval between the receiving advice of my recall and my embarking in soliciting essential aid and succor for these states i entered on my voyage with the pleasing reflection that after a two years faithful service in a most difficult and embarrassed negotiation the issue had been fortunate equal to my utmost wishes that the supplies i had procured and sent out had enabled my brave countrymen and fellow citizens to resist and humble the enemy that the treaty which i had the honor with my colleagues to conclude had engaged one of the most powerful and generous princes in the world to guaranty the liberties and independence of these states <\s>
<s> the great and seasonable aid sent out by him with which after having received the most honorable testimonials of his approbation and even of his esteem as well as that of his ministers and of my late worthy colleague and friend dr franklin i had the honor to embark gave me in prospect the completion of my most sanguine hopes--the total reduction of the british force in north america <\s>
<s> unfortunately the length of our passage defeated the most essential objects of this great and well concerted enterprise <\s>
<s> extensive and important services were however thereby rendered on which i need not be particular <\s>
<s> immediately on my landing in america _i repaired with all possible despatch to congress to inform them of the state of affairs in europe which i had been advised by their resolution was the business i was ordered to return upon <\s>
<s> between my arrival in this city on the 13th of july and my audience before congress on the 21st of august i was informed that the minds of some of my countrymen were prejudiced against me and that insinuations were industriously circulated to effect others i therefore took the earliest opportunity given me and after having laid before congress a general state of foreign affairs and of my proceedings to request that if any thing had been laid to my charge or suggested to my disadvantage i might be made acquainted therewith for that it was probable that in the difficult complicated and embarrassed scenes i had gone through many things might require explanation <\s>
<s> i received no reply and continuing to solicit to have the business i returned upon concluded i was informed that an honorable member produced in congress an extract from a letter from a private gentleman respecting a conversation which passed between him and mr carmichael which implied a censure on my conduct <\s>
<s> on the 26th of september mr secretary thompson acquainted me with the resolution of congress of that day to postpone further consideration of my requests _until the examination of william carmichael <\s>
<s> what the result of that examination was i never knew but having waited some days the urgent necessity for my speedy return pressing on me i applied again and repeatedly that i might finish the business upon which i had been sent for <\s>
<s> days were repeatedly appointed for that purpose and i must suppose business of more importance prevented <\s>
<s> in those letters i laid before congress the unsettled state in which i had by my sudden departure been obliged to leave the accounts and other mercantile transactions of the commissioners and pointed out the injuries which the public must suffer by a delay of their settlement as well as the personal inconveniences i must be subjected to whilst they remained unsettled <\s>
<s> to these letters i beg leave to refer <\s>
<s> in october extracts from letters from mr arthur lee and mr izard were by order of congress delivered me to which i replied at large on the 12th and 22d of the same month my letters are still before congress and to them i refer particularly to that of the 12th which closes in these words as in commercial transactions there are but two sides to an account and every thing goes to the debit or credit the folio for profit or loss so i must solicit that dr franklin and mr adams may be directed to see the settlement of all those accounts immediately on my return to paris and as there has been a charge made by mr lee of profusion of extravagant contracts and the like that those gentlemen be authorised to submit those accounts with every allegation of the kind to the adjustment and determination of gentlemen of ability and character on the spot and that orders may be given that whatever may be found due from the commissioners or either of them may be instantly paid into the hands of the banker for congress and that in like manner said banker may be ordered to pay whatever may be the balance to the person in whose favor the same shall be found <\s>
<s> by this means truth will be demonstrated and justice done which is all i have ever wished for <\s>
<s> in december last i was directed to lay before congress in writing 21 a narrative of my proceedings whilst their commercial and political agent c <\s>
<s> i must ask leave to refer to that narrative at large as many of the honorable members then in congress are now absent and the representatives of several of the states entirely changed <\s>
<s> on a reference it will be found that i again solicited for as early a decision as possible on my conduct that the most thorough examination might be made and to demonstrate what my commercial conduct had been whilst the agent of these states that my accounts might be put in the way of being settled without delay that the part i had acted and the station i had been in could not be considered as a neutral or indifferent one and that approbation or censure was my due c <\s>
<s> when i was favored with that audience i flattered myself that the delays i had met with had given ample time for the most full and perfect scrutiny into every part of my conduct and that if any charges were to be brought against any part of my conduct i should then be informed of them <\s>
<s> i therefore again requested to know if there were any <\s>
<s> i was informed of none <\s>
<s> soon after i was told that a committee was appointed to examine into and report on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> i previously informed congress that i had no copies of the letters written to them by the commissioners from paris that doctor franklin took the care of them and that my having no apprehension of being questioned on them i had not taken duplicates with me therefore requested that i might have copies of them that i might explain anything which might at first sight appear dubious or contradictory <\s>
<s> i afterwards applied to the members of the honorable committee desiring that if in the course of their examination anything should appear doubtful or such as might support a charge against any part of my conduct i might be heard before any report should be made <\s>
<s> i did not receive copies of the letters nor was i ever called upon by the committee who i am informed have made their report as to which i am wholly uninformed <\s>
<s> soon after this report was delivered to congress having been persecuted in the public papers for several months in the most scandalous virulent and licentious manner and accused before the public of crimes of the blackest complexion i again addressed myself to congress and as their servant claimed their protection and that i might be heard in the most public manner or in any other way they thought proper <\s>
<s> this letter of the 30th of march remains unanswered and i now pray the contents of it may be considered <\s>
<s> the part i acted as political agent and commissioner for congress is well known and may be judged of with certainty at this time and the settlement of mine and the commissioners accounts which i have repeatedly solicited will demonstrate what my commercial conduct has been <\s>
<s> if in the commercial i have not acted with prudence and integrity if i have neglected to supply these states with stores to the utmost of my power and have either wasted or embezzled the public monies the interest of the public requires that speedy justice be done and the settlement of the commissioners accounts will at once acquit or condemn me <\s>
<s> if in my political department i have in any instance neglected or betrayed the interests of my country if i have conducted weakly or wickedly or both the public ought to know it and i ought to be punished <\s>
<s> if on the contrary i sacrificed all private considerations and put my life as well as fortune to the hazard to procure relief and assistance for these states from abroad if unsupported by remittances from hence without credit or friends and a stranger to the language and manners of the country i was sent to negotiate in i surmounted every obstacle and in a few months obtained and sent out large supplies if i was assiduous and indefatigable for the space of near two years in france in the commercial as well as political affairs of these states at times even to my personal danger if so far from having embezzled the public monies i neglected my private fortune and received nothing but my necessary expenses whilst transacting this business if a principal share of the political negotiations fell on me and if jointly with my colleagues i brought them to a happy and honorable issue and individually acquired the confidence and esteem of his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as of the nation in general and if at my private solicitations in part after my recall a strong fleet and armament were sent out to the relief of these states if these are facts which they certainly are and the greater part of them long since fully ascertained and the others ascertainable by the settlement of the commissioners accounts which i have from the first requested i flatter myself justice will be done by congress and that the artifices of interested and wicked men will not prevail to delay it and thereby injure the public and their servant more essentially than injustice itself would do <\s>
<s> i therefore with the sensibility of an innocent yet injured man and with the firmness of a free independent citizen ask for justice fully confident that congress will not refuse or delay it <\s>
<s> i owe too much to those great personages who generously patronized and protected me in europe to my countrymen and to myself to suffer my character and conduct to remain longer under any uncertainty <\s>
<s> when the part i acted abroad in the service of these states my recall the circumstances of my return my reception and the delays i have since met with are reviewed i think my case will be found peculiar <\s>
<s> permit me then to repeat that my services have been in two departments political and commercial every thing respecting the first is already well known the closing of the accounts will demonstrate what the latter has been on the first congress is now able to judge justice to the public as well as to myself calls for their determination <\s>
<s> if there are charges against me in either of the characters i have supported i must consider myself entitled to know what they are and to be permitted to answer <\s>
<s> i cannot close this letter without complaining to congress of the abuse i have met with in the public papers from a writer who was lately their confidential servant and who has abused their confidence to deceive and impose on the free citizens of these states and to injure me in the public opinion also of the partial and injurious manner in which i have been treated by others who deeply interested by family and other connexions to support my enemies represent my conduct and the letters written by the commissioners and myself as inconsistent and contradictory whilst i remain deprived of any opportunity to explain them <\s>
<s> my utmost ambition and wishes have ever been to serve these states and to merit the title of their faithful and approved servant nothing can deprive me of the consciousness of having served faithfully and with integrity <\s>
<s> if my country have no further service for me my first object as well as my duty must be to justify my conduct and to rescue my reputation and character from the injury and abuse of wicked men and to do this i again ask of congress what i consider as my right their decision on my conduct as their servant and if any part thereof is questioned i may be permitted to explain and vindicate the same which i have often said and again repeat the settlement of the commissioners accounts will enable me to do even to mathematical demonstration <\s>
<s> any further delay in my case must have all the consequences of a refusal and as i have ever relied with confidence on the justice of congress and long waited their decision i flatter myself it will no longer be postponed <\s>

<s> in my narrative i informed congress that the clothes cost 32s <\s>

<s> philadelphia 26th april 1779 <\s>
<s> sir i was this day surprised to hear that in a memorial you had presented to congress you had said that the suits of clothes furnished by messrs sabbatier and desprez ought not to cost or did not cost more than 32 or 34 livres each delivered in the ports of france <\s>
<s> permit me to remind you that these clothes were transported from paris and the other places where they were made up to the sea ports at the expense of the commissioners that they cost something more than 34 livres exclusive of the transportation as i am positive the accounts themselves will show <\s>
<s> i must therefore presume if my information is right that you may be under some mistake as to this matter and therefore pray you if you have the copies of these accounts that you will turn to them which must convince you of it or the error is with me for as i recollect these suits of clothes cost when delivered on board nearest 36 livres on an average and those purchased from mons <\s>
<s> monthieu a trifle more and those from m <\s>
<s> coder which were of a different fashion considerably more this occasioned my saying generally in my narrative to congress that the suits cost 32s <\s>

<s> philadelphia 26th april 1779 <\s>
<s> sir i have this moment received your favor of this date <\s>
<s> in my memorial to congress i said that each complete suit ought not to cost more than 33 or 34 livres not 32 or 34 delivered in the sea ports <\s>
<s> i spoke totally from memory and believe i have made a mistake by taking the price in paris or montpellier for the price at which they would stand at the sea ports <\s>
<s> admitting my error they would cost no more than 36 or 37 livres the suit according to the best calculation i can make from memory <\s>

<s> philadelphia 30th april 1779 <\s>
<s> sir in my letter of monday last i mentioned my intention to leave town in the course of the week <\s>
<s> i am now waiting for no other purpose but to know if congress will take notice of the requests i have so often troubled them with <\s>
<s> the circumstances under which i left france in obedience to their orders and with a view of promoting their service in the greatest and most essential manner it is well known rendered it impossible to have the accounts of the commissioners and my own connected immediately with theirs settled and closed so that the vouchers could be procured and brought out with me <\s>
<s> but a few days past between the knowledge of my recall and of my actual setting out on my return <\s>
<s> one condition of sending out the toulon fleet and of my embarking in it was that the most profound secrecy should be observed and the greatest despatch made <\s>
<s> the king's ministers did not think fit to communicate this secret to my colleague mr lee nor did they leave me at liberty to do it i had as little grounds for confidence in that gentleman as the ministers had and it is evident from their letters and declarations that they never had any <\s>
<s> yet such is my peculiar situation that i find myself blamed and censured by many in congress as well as out for not having performed an impossibility and am represented as a defaulter and as having misapplied or embezzled the public monies at once to prevent my future usefulness to my country and to the ruin of my private fortune and character <\s>
<s> thus situated i can but appeal once more to the justice of congress and remind them that i brought with me and delivered them it is now more than seven months since an account from under the banker's hands of all the monies received and paid out by him and to whom paid that in my letter of the 12th of october i explained to congress for what purposes those payments were made and in my answers to mr lee's objections to these contracts that i proved him to have been acquainted with them and that he signed himself the orders for the money for the greater part of them <\s>
<s> i am informed by several honorable gentlemen in congress that many of the members from their absence at the time or from their taking their seats since the delivering in of that account and my letter of the 12th of october are to this moment uninformed of either <\s>
<s> this obliges me to refer to them at this time and though i have not the vouchers to support every article yet i will cheerfully put my reputation as a merchant as an honest man and as a frugal servant of the public on the examination of those accounts the circumstances under which they were taken at the same time to be considered <\s>
<s> that account commences in february 1777 and ends the 27th day of march 1778 three days before my leaving paris <\s>
<s> it will show that the whole amount of the monies received by the commissioners was 3,753 250 livres and their expenditures 4,046 988 livres 7 sols and by the general state of the account delivered the 12th of october it appears for what those expenditures were made <\s>
<s> after deducting the sums paid for large contracts for supplies c <\s>
<s> which are particularised there will be left 219,250 livres 1 sol 11 deniers equal to Â £ 9644 <\s>
<s> 7-1 2 sterling for the commissioners expenses for almost fifteen months and for small purchases and for a variety of services not possible to be particularised without the accounts at large <\s>
<s> i might with safety rest this whole sum on the score of the commissioners expenses for this space of time and support it on mr lee's letter to congress in which he says that mr adams and himself were fully convinced that they could not live at paris under Â £ 3000 sterling or about 70,000 livres each annually <\s>
<s> had the commissioners expended at that rate from february 1777 to march 1778 the whole of the sum would be no more than a sufficiency to supply their expenses but this was not the case <\s>
<s> the commissioners in the whole received out of it the sum of 115,480 livres 5 sols 6 deniers for their expenses and private disbursements as will appear by the account enclosed of this dr franklin received 27,841 livres mr lee 52,039 livres 5 sols 9 deniers and myself 35,600 livres <\s>
<s> it is true at the same time that mr lee had in his hands the whole of the money received from spain which he disposed of without the interference of the other commissioners <\s>

<s> thus situated i can but appeal once more to the justice of congress and remind them that i brought with me and delivered them it is now more than seven months since an account from under the banker's hands of all the monies received and paid out by him and to whom paid that in my letter of the 12th of october i explained to congress for what purposes those payments were made and in my answers to mr lee's objections to these contracts that i proved him to have been acquainted with them and that he signed himself the orders for the money for the greater part of them <\s>

<s> the great and seasonable aid sent out by him with which after having received the most honorable testimonials of his approbation and even of his esteem as well as that of his ministers and of my late worthy colleague and friend dr franklin i had the honor to embark gave me in prospect the completion of my most sanguine hopes--the total reduction of the british force in north america <\s>
<s> unfortunately the length of our passage defeated the most essential objects of this great and well concerted enterprise <\s>
<s> extensive and important services were however thereby rendered on which i need not be particular <\s>
<s> immediately on my landing in america _i repaired with all possible despatch to congress to inform them of the state of affairs in europe which i had been advised by their resolution was the business i was ordered to return upon <\s>
<s> between my arrival in this city on the 13th of july and my audience before congress on the 21st of august i was informed that the minds of some of my countrymen were prejudiced against me and that insinuations were industriously circulated to effect others i therefore took the earliest opportunity given me and after having laid before congress a general state of foreign affairs and of my proceedings to request that if any thing had been laid to my charge or suggested to my disadvantage i might be made acquainted therewith for that it was probable that in the difficult complicated and embarrassed scenes i had gone through many things might require explanation <\s>
<s> i received no reply and continuing to solicit to have the business i returned upon concluded i was informed that an honorable member produced in congress an extract from a letter from a private gentleman respecting a conversation which passed between him and mr carmichael which implied a censure on my conduct <\s>
<s> on the 26th of september mr secretary thompson acquainted me with the resolution of congress of that day to postpone further consideration of my requests _until the examination of william carmichael <\s>
<s> what the result of that examination was i never knew but having waited some days the urgent necessity for my speedy return pressing on me i applied again and repeatedly that i might finish the business upon which i had been sent for <\s>
<s> days were repeatedly appointed for that purpose and i must suppose business of more importance prevented <\s>
<s> in those letters i laid before congress the unsettled state in which i had by my sudden departure been obliged to leave the accounts and other mercantile transactions of the commissioners and pointed out the injuries which the public must suffer by a delay of their settlement as well as the personal inconveniences i must be subjected to whilst they remained unsettled <\s>
<s> to these letters i beg leave to refer <\s>
<s> in october extracts from letters from mr arthur lee and mr izard were by order of congress delivered me to which i replied at large on the 12th and 22d of the same month my letters are still before congress and to them i refer particularly to that of the 12th which closes in these words as in commercial transactions there are but two sides to an account and every thing goes to the debit or credit the folio for profit or loss so i must solicit that dr franklin and mr adams may be directed to see the settlement of all those accounts immediately on my return to paris and as there has been a charge made by mr lee of profusion of extravagant contracts and the like that those gentlemen be authorised to submit those accounts with every allegation of the kind to the adjustment and determination of gentlemen of ability and character on the spot and that orders may be given that whatever may be found due from the commissioners or either of them may be instantly paid into the hands of the banker for congress and that in like manner said banker may be ordered to pay whatever may be the balance to the person in whose favor the same shall be found <\s>
<s> by this means truth will be demonstrated and justice done which is all i have ever wished for <\s>
<s> in december last i was directed to lay before congress in writing 21 a narrative of my proceedings whilst their commercial and political agent c <\s>
<s> i must ask leave to refer to that narrative at large as many of the honorable members then in congress are now absent and the representatives of several of the states entirely changed <\s>
<s> on a reference it will be found that i again solicited for as early a decision as possible on my conduct that the most thorough examination might be made and to demonstrate what my commercial conduct had been whilst the agent of these states that my accounts might be put in the way of being settled without delay that the part i had acted and the station i had been in could not be considered as a neutral or indifferent one and that approbation or censure was my due c <\s>
<s> when i was favored with that audience i flattered myself that the delays i had met with had given ample time for the most full and perfect scrutiny into every part of my conduct and that if any charges were to be brought against any part of my conduct i should then be informed of them <\s>
<s> i therefore again requested to know if there were any <\s>
<s> i was informed of none <\s>
<s> soon after i was told that a committee was appointed to examine into and report on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> i previously informed congress that i had no copies of the letters written to them by the commissioners from paris that doctor franklin took the care of them and that my having no apprehension of being questioned on them i had not taken duplicates with me therefore requested that i might have copies of them that i might explain anything which might at first sight appear dubious or contradictory <\s>
<s> i afterwards applied to the members of the honorable committee desiring that if in the course of their examination anything should appear doubtful or such as might support a charge against any part of my conduct i might be heard before any report should be made <\s>
<s> i did not receive copies of the letters nor was i ever called upon by the committee who i am informed have made their report as to which i am wholly uninformed <\s>
<s> soon after this report was delivered to congress having been persecuted in the public papers for several months in the most scandalous virulent and licentious manner and accused before the public of crimes of the blackest complexion i again addressed myself to congress and as their servant claimed their protection and that i might be heard in the most public manner or in any other way they thought proper <\s>
<s> this letter of the 30th of march remains unanswered and i now pray the contents of it may be considered <\s>
<s> the part i acted as political agent and commissioner for congress is well known and may be judged of with certainty at this time and the settlement of mine and the commissioners accounts which i have repeatedly solicited will demonstrate what my commercial conduct has been <\s>
<s> if in the commercial i have not acted with prudence and integrity if i have neglected to supply these states with stores to the utmost of my power and have either wasted or embezzled the public monies the interest of the public requires that speedy justice be done and the settlement of the commissioners accounts will at once acquit or condemn me <\s>
<s> if in my political department i have in any instance neglected or betrayed the interests of my country if i have conducted weakly or wickedly or both the public ought to know it and i ought to be punished <\s>
<s> if on the contrary i sacrificed all private considerations and put my life as well as fortune to the hazard to procure relief and assistance for these states from abroad if unsupported by remittances from hence without credit or friends and a stranger to the language and manners of the country i was sent to negotiate in i surmounted every obstacle and in a few months obtained and sent out large supplies if i was assiduous and indefatigable for the space of near two years in france in the commercial as well as political affairs of these states at times even to my personal danger if so far from having embezzled the public monies i neglected my private fortune and received nothing but my necessary expenses whilst transacting this business if a principal share of the political negotiations fell on me and if jointly with my colleagues i brought them to a happy and honorable issue and individually acquired the confidence and esteem of his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as of the nation in general and if at my private solicitations in part after my recall a strong fleet and armament were sent out to the relief of these states if these are facts which they certainly are and the greater part of them long since fully ascertained and the others ascertainable by the settlement of the commissioners accounts which i have from the first requested i flatter myself justice will be done by congress and that the artifices of interested and wicked men will not prevail to delay it and thereby injure the public and their servant more essentially than injustice itself would do <\s>
<s> i therefore with the sensibility of an innocent yet injured man and with the firmness of a free independent citizen ask for justice fully confident that congress will not refuse or delay it <\s>
<s> i owe too much to those great personages who generously patronized and protected me in europe to my countrymen and to myself to suffer my character and conduct to remain longer under any uncertainty <\s>

<s> the circumstances under which i left france in obedience to their orders and with a view of promoting their service in the greatest and most essential manner it is well known rendered it impossible to have the accounts of the commissioners and my own connected immediately with theirs settled and closed so that the vouchers could be procured and brought out with me <\s>
<s> but a few days past between the knowledge of my recall and of my actual setting out on my return <\s>
<s> one condition of sending out the toulon fleet and of my embarking in it was that the most profound secrecy should be observed and the greatest despatch made <\s>
<s> the king's ministers did not think fit to communicate this secret to my colleague mr lee nor did they leave me at liberty to do it i had as little grounds for confidence in that gentleman as the ministers had and it is evident from their letters and declarations that they never had any <\s>

<s> thus situated i can but appeal once more to the justice of congress and remind them that i brought with me and delivered them it is now more than seven months since an account from under the banker's hands of all the monies received and paid out by him and to whom paid that in my letter of the 12th of october i explained to congress for what purposes those payments were made and in my answers to mr lee's objections to these contracts that i proved him to have been acquainted with them and that he signed himself the orders for the money for the greater part of them <\s>

<s> that account commences in february 1777 and ends the 27th day of march 1778 three days before my leaving paris <\s>
<s> it will show that the whole amount of the monies received by the commissioners was 3,753 250 livres and their expenditures 4,046 988 livres 7 sols and by the general state of the account delivered the 12th of october it appears for what those expenditures were made <\s>

<s> had the commissioners expended at that rate from february 1777 to march 1778 the whole of the sum would be no more than a sufficiency to supply their expenses but this was not the case <\s>

<s> the great and seasonable aid sent out by him with which after having received the most honorable testimonials of his approbation and even of his esteem as well as that of his ministers and of my late worthy colleague and friend dr franklin i had the honor to embark gave me in prospect the completion of my most sanguine hopes--the total reduction of the british force in north america <\s>

<s> i received no reply and continuing to solicit to have the business i returned upon concluded i was informed that an honorable member produced in congress an extract from a letter from a private gentleman respecting a conversation which passed between him and mr carmichael which implied a censure on my conduct <\s>

<s> sir i was this day surprised to hear that in a memorial you had presented to congress you had said that the suits of clothes furnished by messrs sabbatier and desprez ought not to cost or did not cost more than 32 or 34 livres each delivered in the ports of france <\s>
<s> permit me to remind you that these clothes were transported from paris and the other places where they were made up to the sea ports at the expense of the commissioners that they cost something more than 34 livres exclusive of the transportation as i am positive the accounts themselves will show <\s>

<s> monthieu a trifle more and those from m <\s>

<s> i spoke totally from memory and believe i have made a mistake by taking the price in paris or montpellier for the price at which they would stand at the sea ports <\s>

<s> sir in my letter of monday last i mentioned my intention to leave town in the course of the week <\s>
<s> i am now waiting for no other purpose but to know if congress will take notice of the requests i have so often troubled them with <\s>
<s> the circumstances under which i left france in obedience to their orders and with a view of promoting their service in the greatest and most essential manner it is well known rendered it impossible to have the accounts of the commissioners and my own connected immediately with theirs settled and closed so that the vouchers could be procured and brought out with me <\s>
<s> but a few days past between the knowledge of my recall and of my actual setting out on my return <\s>
<s> one condition of sending out the toulon fleet and of my embarking in it was that the most profound secrecy should be observed and the greatest despatch made <\s>
<s> the king's ministers did not think fit to communicate this secret to my colleague mr lee nor did they leave me at liberty to do it i had as little grounds for confidence in that gentleman as the ministers had and it is evident from their letters and declarations that they never had any <\s>
<s> yet such is my peculiar situation that i find myself blamed and censured by many in congress as well as out for not having performed an impossibility and am represented as a defaulter and as having misapplied or embezzled the public monies at once to prevent my future usefulness to my country and to the ruin of my private fortune and character <\s>
<s> thus situated i can but appeal once more to the justice of congress and remind them that i brought with me and delivered them it is now more than seven months since an account from under the banker's hands of all the monies received and paid out by him and to whom paid that in my letter of the 12th of october i explained to congress for what purposes those payments were made and in my answers to mr lee's objections to these contracts that i proved him to have been acquainted with them and that he signed himself the orders for the money for the greater part of them <\s>
<s> i am informed by several honorable gentlemen in congress that many of the members from their absence at the time or from their taking their seats since the delivering in of that account and my letter of the 12th of october are to this moment uninformed of either <\s>

<s> that account commences in february 1777 and ends the 27th day of march 1778 three days before my leaving paris <\s>
<s> it will show that the whole amount of the monies received by the commissioners was 3,753 250 livres and their expenditures 4,046 988 livres 7 sols and by the general state of the account delivered the 12th of october it appears for what those expenditures were made <\s>

<s> and 2d instant i take the liberty of applying again to congress to remind them of my situation <\s>
<s> it is now more than twelve months since in obedience to their orders i left france to return to my native country <\s>
<s> having employed the short interval between the receiving advice of my recall and my embarking in soliciting essential aid and succor for these states i entered on my voyage with the pleasing reflection that after a two years faithful service in a most difficult and embarrassed negotiation the issue had been fortunate equal to my utmost wishes that the supplies i had procured and sent out had enabled my brave countrymen and fellow citizens to resist and humble the enemy that the treaty which i had the honor with my colleagues to conclude had engaged one of the most powerful and generous princes in the world to guaranty the liberties and independence of these states <\s>
<s> the great and seasonable aid sent out by him with which after having received the most honorable testimonials of his approbation and even of his esteem as well as that of his ministers and of my late worthy colleague and friend dr franklin i had the honor to embark gave me in prospect the completion of my most sanguine hopes--the total reduction of the british force in north america <\s>
<s> unfortunately the length of our passage defeated the most essential objects of this great and well concerted enterprise <\s>
<s> extensive and important services were however thereby rendered on which i need not be particular <\s>
<s> immediately on my landing in america _i repaired with all possible despatch to congress to inform them of the state of affairs in europe which i had been advised by their resolution was the business i was ordered to return upon <\s>
<s> between my arrival in this city on the 13th of july and my audience before congress on the 21st of august i was informed that the minds of some of my countrymen were prejudiced against me and that insinuations were industriously circulated to effect others i therefore took the earliest opportunity given me and after having laid before congress a general state of foreign affairs and of my proceedings to request that if any thing had been laid to my charge or suggested to my disadvantage i might be made acquainted therewith for that it was probable that in the difficult complicated and embarrassed scenes i had gone through many things might require explanation <\s>
<s> i received no reply and continuing to solicit to have the business i returned upon concluded i was informed that an honorable member produced in congress an extract from a letter from a private gentleman respecting a conversation which passed between him and mr carmichael which implied a censure on my conduct <\s>
<s> on the 26th of september mr secretary thompson acquainted me with the resolution of congress of that day to postpone further consideration of my requests _until the examination of william carmichael <\s>
<s> what the result of that examination was i never knew but having waited some days the urgent necessity for my speedy return pressing on me i applied again and repeatedly that i might finish the business upon which i had been sent for <\s>
<s> days were repeatedly appointed for that purpose and i must suppose business of more importance prevented <\s>
<s> in those letters i laid before congress the unsettled state in which i had by my sudden departure been obliged to leave the accounts and other mercantile transactions of the commissioners and pointed out the injuries which the public must suffer by a delay of their settlement as well as the personal inconveniences i must be subjected to whilst they remained unsettled <\s>
<s> to these letters i beg leave to refer <\s>
<s> in october extracts from letters from mr arthur lee and mr izard were by order of congress delivered me to which i replied at large on the 12th and 22d of the same month my letters are still before congress and to them i refer particularly to that of the 12th which closes in these words as in commercial transactions there are but two sides to an account and every thing goes to the debit or credit the folio for profit or loss so i must solicit that dr franklin and mr adams may be directed to see the settlement of all those accounts immediately on my return to paris and as there has been a charge made by mr lee of profusion of extravagant contracts and the like that those gentlemen be authorised to submit those accounts with every allegation of the kind to the adjustment and determination of gentlemen of ability and character on the spot and that orders may be given that whatever may be found due from the commissioners or either of them may be instantly paid into the hands of the banker for congress and that in like manner said banker may be ordered to pay whatever may be the balance to the person in whose favor the same shall be found <\s>
<s> by this means truth will be demonstrated and justice done which is all i have ever wished for <\s>
<s> in december last i was directed to lay before congress in writing 21 a narrative of my proceedings whilst their commercial and political agent c <\s>
<s> i must ask leave to refer to that narrative at large as many of the honorable members then in congress are now absent and the representatives of several of the states entirely changed <\s>
<s> on a reference it will be found that i again solicited for as early a decision as possible on my conduct that the most thorough examination might be made and to demonstrate what my commercial conduct had been whilst the agent of these states that my accounts might be put in the way of being settled without delay that the part i had acted and the station i had been in could not be considered as a neutral or indifferent one and that approbation or censure was my due c <\s>
<s> when i was favored with that audience i flattered myself that the delays i had met with had given ample time for the most full and perfect scrutiny into every part of my conduct and that if any charges were to be brought against any part of my conduct i should then be informed of them <\s>
<s> i therefore again requested to know if there were any <\s>
<s> i was informed of none <\s>
<s> soon after i was told that a committee was appointed to examine into and report on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> i previously informed congress that i had no copies of the letters written to them by the commissioners from paris that doctor franklin took the care of them and that my having no apprehension of being questioned on them i had not taken duplicates with me therefore requested that i might have copies of them that i might explain anything which might at first sight appear dubious or contradictory <\s>
<s> i afterwards applied to the members of the honorable committee desiring that if in the course of their examination anything should appear doubtful or such as might support a charge against any part of my conduct i might be heard before any report should be made <\s>
<s> i did not receive copies of the letters nor was i ever called upon by the committee who i am informed have made their report as to which i am wholly uninformed <\s>
<s> soon after this report was delivered to congress having been persecuted in the public papers for several months in the most scandalous virulent and licentious manner and accused before the public of crimes of the blackest complexion i again addressed myself to congress and as their servant claimed their protection and that i might be heard in the most public manner or in any other way they thought proper <\s>
<s> this letter of the 30th of march remains unanswered and i now pray the contents of it may be considered <\s>
<s> the part i acted as political agent and commissioner for congress is well known and may be judged of with certainty at this time and the settlement of mine and the commissioners accounts which i have repeatedly solicited will demonstrate what my commercial conduct has been <\s>
<s> if in the commercial i have not acted with prudence and integrity if i have neglected to supply these states with stores to the utmost of my power and have either wasted or embezzled the public monies the interest of the public requires that speedy justice be done and the settlement of the commissioners accounts will at once acquit or condemn me <\s>
<s> if in my political department i have in any instance neglected or betrayed the interests of my country if i have conducted weakly or wickedly or both the public ought to know it and i ought to be punished <\s>
<s> if on the contrary i sacrificed all private considerations and put my life as well as fortune to the hazard to procure relief and assistance for these states from abroad if unsupported by remittances from hence without credit or friends and a stranger to the language and manners of the country i was sent to negotiate in i surmounted every obstacle and in a few months obtained and sent out large supplies if i was assiduous and indefatigable for the space of near two years in france in the commercial as well as political affairs of these states at times even to my personal danger if so far from having embezzled the public monies i neglected my private fortune and received nothing but my necessary expenses whilst transacting this business if a principal share of the political negotiations fell on me and if jointly with my colleagues i brought them to a happy and honorable issue and individually acquired the confidence and esteem of his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as of the nation in general and if at my private solicitations in part after my recall a strong fleet and armament were sent out to the relief of these states if these are facts which they certainly are and the greater part of them long since fully ascertained and the others ascertainable by the settlement of the commissioners accounts which i have from the first requested i flatter myself justice will be done by congress and that the artifices of interested and wicked men will not prevail to delay it and thereby injure the public and their servant more essentially than injustice itself would do <\s>
<s> i therefore with the sensibility of an innocent yet injured man and with the firmness of a free independent citizen ask for justice fully confident that congress will not refuse or delay it <\s>
<s> i owe too much to those great personages who generously patronized and protected me in europe to my countrymen and to myself to suffer my character and conduct to remain longer under any uncertainty <\s>
<s> when the part i acted abroad in the service of these states my recall the circumstances of my return my reception and the delays i have since met with are reviewed i think my case will be found peculiar <\s>
<s> permit me then to repeat that my services have been in two departments political and commercial every thing respecting the first is already well known the closing of the accounts will demonstrate what the latter has been on the first congress is now able to judge justice to the public as well as to myself calls for their determination <\s>
<s> if there are charges against me in either of the characters i have supported i must consider myself entitled to know what they are and to be permitted to answer <\s>
<s> i cannot close this letter without complaining to congress of the abuse i have met with in the public papers from a writer who was lately their confidential servant and who has abused their confidence to deceive and impose on the free citizens of these states and to injure me in the public opinion also of the partial and injurious manner in which i have been treated by others who deeply interested by family and other connexions to support my enemies represent my conduct and the letters written by the commissioners and myself as inconsistent and contradictory whilst i remain deprived of any opportunity to explain them <\s>
<s> my utmost ambition and wishes have ever been to serve these states and to merit the title of their faithful and approved servant nothing can deprive me of the consciousness of having served faithfully and with integrity <\s>
<s> if my country have no further service for me my first object as well as my duty must be to justify my conduct and to rescue my reputation and character from the injury and abuse of wicked men and to do this i again ask of congress what i consider as my right their decision on my conduct as their servant and if any part thereof is questioned i may be permitted to explain and vindicate the same which i have often said and again repeat the settlement of the commissioners accounts will enable me to do even to mathematical demonstration <\s>
<s> any further delay in my case must have all the consequences of a refusal and as i have ever relied with confidence on the justice of congress and long waited their decision i flatter myself it will no longer be postponed <\s>

<s> having employed the short interval between the receiving advice of my recall and my embarking in soliciting essential aid and succor for these states i entered on my voyage with the pleasing reflection that after a two years faithful service in a most difficult and embarrassed negotiation the issue had been fortunate equal to my utmost wishes that the supplies i had procured and sent out had enabled my brave countrymen and fellow citizens to resist and humble the enemy that the treaty which i had the honor with my colleagues to conclude had engaged one of the most powerful and generous princes in the world to guaranty the liberties and independence of these states <\s>
<s> the great and seasonable aid sent out by him with which after having received the most honorable testimonials of his approbation and even of his esteem as well as that of his ministers and of my late worthy colleague and friend dr franklin i had the honor to embark gave me in prospect the completion of my most sanguine hopes--the total reduction of the british force in north america <\s>
<s> unfortunately the length of our passage defeated the most essential objects of this great and well concerted enterprise <\s>

<s> between my arrival in this city on the 13th of july and my audience before congress on the 21st of august i was informed that the minds of some of my countrymen were prejudiced against me and that insinuations were industriously circulated to effect others i therefore took the earliest opportunity given me and after having laid before congress a general state of foreign affairs and of my proceedings to request that if any thing had been laid to my charge or suggested to my disadvantage i might be made acquainted therewith for that it was probable that in the difficult complicated and embarrassed scenes i had gone through many things might require explanation <\s>
<s> i received no reply and continuing to solicit to have the business i returned upon concluded i was informed that an honorable member produced in congress an extract from a letter from a private gentleman respecting a conversation which passed between him and mr carmichael which implied a censure on my conduct <\s>
<s> on the 26th of september mr secretary thompson acquainted me with the resolution of congress of that day to postpone further consideration of my requests _until the examination of william carmichael <\s>
<s> what the result of that examination was i never knew but having waited some days the urgent necessity for my speedy return pressing on me i applied again and repeatedly that i might finish the business upon which i had been sent for <\s>
<s> days were repeatedly appointed for that purpose and i must suppose business of more importance prevented <\s>
<s> in those letters i laid before congress the unsettled state in which i had by my sudden departure been obliged to leave the accounts and other mercantile transactions of the commissioners and pointed out the injuries which the public must suffer by a delay of their settlement as well as the personal inconveniences i must be subjected to whilst they remained unsettled <\s>
<s> to these letters i beg leave to refer <\s>
<s> in october extracts from letters from mr arthur lee and mr izard were by order of congress delivered me to which i replied at large on the 12th and 22d of the same month my letters are still before congress and to them i refer particularly to that of the 12th which closes in these words as in commercial transactions there are but two sides to an account and every thing goes to the debit or credit the folio for profit or loss so i must solicit that dr franklin and mr adams may be directed to see the settlement of all those accounts immediately on my return to paris and as there has been a charge made by mr lee of profusion of extravagant contracts and the like that those gentlemen be authorised to submit those accounts with every allegation of the kind to the adjustment and determination of gentlemen of ability and character on the spot and that orders may be given that whatever may be found due from the commissioners or either of them may be instantly paid into the hands of the banker for congress and that in like manner said banker may be ordered to pay whatever may be the balance to the person in whose favor the same shall be found <\s>
<s> by this means truth will be demonstrated and justice done which is all i have ever wished for <\s>

<s> on a reference it will be found that i again solicited for as early a decision as possible on my conduct that the most thorough examination might be made and to demonstrate what my commercial conduct had been whilst the agent of these states that my accounts might be put in the way of being settled without delay that the part i had acted and the station i had been in could not be considered as a neutral or indifferent one and that approbation or censure was my due c <\s>
<s> when i was favored with that audience i flattered myself that the delays i had met with had given ample time for the most full and perfect scrutiny into every part of my conduct and that if any charges were to be brought against any part of my conduct i should then be informed of them <\s>

<s> to these letters i beg leave to refer <\s>
<s> in october extracts from letters from mr arthur lee and mr izard were by order of congress delivered me to which i replied at large on the 12th and 22d of the same month my letters are still before congress and to them i refer particularly to that of the 12th which closes in these words as in commercial transactions there are but two sides to an account and every thing goes to the debit or credit the folio for profit or loss so i must solicit that dr franklin and mr adams may be directed to see the settlement of all those accounts immediately on my return to paris and as there has been a charge made by mr lee of profusion of extravagant contracts and the like that those gentlemen be authorised to submit those accounts with every allegation of the kind to the adjustment and determination of gentlemen of ability and character on the spot and that orders may be given that whatever may be found due from the commissioners or either of them may be instantly paid into the hands of the banker for congress and that in like manner said banker may be ordered to pay whatever may be the balance to the person in whose favor the same shall be found <\s>

<s> sir in my letter of monday last i mentioned my intention to leave town in the course of the week <\s>
<s> i am now waiting for no other purpose but to know if congress will take notice of the requests i have so often troubled them with <\s>
<s> the circumstances under which i left france in obedience to their orders and with a view of promoting their service in the greatest and most essential manner it is well known rendered it impossible to have the accounts of the commissioners and my own connected immediately with theirs settled and closed so that the vouchers could be procured and brought out with me <\s>
<s> but a few days past between the knowledge of my recall and of my actual setting out on my return <\s>
<s> one condition of sending out the toulon fleet and of my embarking in it was that the most profound secrecy should be observed and the greatest despatch made <\s>
<s> the king's ministers did not think fit to communicate this secret to my colleague mr lee nor did they leave me at liberty to do it i had as little grounds for confidence in that gentleman as the ministers had and it is evident from their letters and declarations that they never had any <\s>
<s> yet such is my peculiar situation that i find myself blamed and censured by many in congress as well as out for not having performed an impossibility and am represented as a defaulter and as having misapplied or embezzled the public monies at once to prevent my future usefulness to my country and to the ruin of my private fortune and character <\s>
<s> thus situated i can but appeal once more to the justice of congress and remind them that i brought with me and delivered them it is now more than seven months since an account from under the banker's hands of all the monies received and paid out by him and to whom paid that in my letter of the 12th of october i explained to congress for what purposes those payments were made and in my answers to mr lee's objections to these contracts that i proved him to have been acquainted with them and that he signed himself the orders for the money for the greater part of them <\s>
<s> i am informed by several honorable gentlemen in congress that many of the members from their absence at the time or from their taking their seats since the delivering in of that account and my letter of the 12th of october are to this moment uninformed of either <\s>

<s> that account commences in february 1777 and ends the 27th day of march 1778 three days before my leaving paris <\s>
<s> it will show that the whole amount of the monies received by the commissioners was 3,753 250 livres and their expenditures 4,046 988 livres 7 sols and by the general state of the account delivered the 12th of october it appears for what those expenditures were made <\s>

<s> 7-1 2 sterling for the commissioners expenses for almost fifteen months and for small purchases and for a variety of services not possible to be particularised without the accounts at large <\s>
<s> i might with safety rest this whole sum on the score of the commissioners expenses for this space of time and support it on mr lee's letter to congress in which he says that mr adams and himself were fully convinced that they could not live at paris under Â £ 3000 sterling or about 70,000 livres each annually <\s>
<s> had the commissioners expended at that rate from february 1777 to march 1778 the whole of the sum would be no more than a sufficiency to supply their expenses but this was not the case <\s>

<s> i spoke totally from memory and believe i have made a mistake by taking the price in paris or montpellier for the price at which they would stand at the sea ports <\s>

<s> sir in my letter of monday last i mentioned my intention to leave town in the course of the week <\s>
<s> i am now waiting for no other purpose but to know if congress will take notice of the requests i have so often troubled them with <\s>
<s> the circumstances under which i left france in obedience to their orders and with a view of promoting their service in the greatest and most essential manner it is well known rendered it impossible to have the accounts of the commissioners and my own connected immediately with theirs settled and closed so that the vouchers could be procured and brought out with me <\s>
<s> but a few days past between the knowledge of my recall and of my actual setting out on my return <\s>
<s> one condition of sending out the toulon fleet and of my embarking in it was that the most profound secrecy should be observed and the greatest despatch made <\s>
<s> the king's ministers did not think fit to communicate this secret to my colleague mr lee nor did they leave me at liberty to do it i had as little grounds for confidence in that gentleman as the ministers had and it is evident from their letters and declarations that they never had any <\s>
<s> yet such is my peculiar situation that i find myself blamed and censured by many in congress as well as out for not having performed an impossibility and am represented as a defaulter and as having misapplied or embezzled the public monies at once to prevent my future usefulness to my country and to the ruin of my private fortune and character <\s>
<s> thus situated i can but appeal once more to the justice of congress and remind them that i brought with me and delivered them it is now more than seven months since an account from under the banker's hands of all the monies received and paid out by him and to whom paid that in my letter of the 12th of october i explained to congress for what purposes those payments were made and in my answers to mr lee's objections to these contracts that i proved him to have been acquainted with them and that he signed himself the orders for the money for the greater part of them <\s>
<s> i am informed by several honorable gentlemen in congress that many of the members from their absence at the time or from their taking their seats since the delivering in of that account and my letter of the 12th of october are to this moment uninformed of either <\s>
<s> this obliges me to refer to them at this time and though i have not the vouchers to support every article yet i will cheerfully put my reputation as a merchant as an honest man and as a frugal servant of the public on the examination of those accounts the circumstances under which they were taken at the same time to be considered <\s>
<s> that account commences in february 1777 and ends the 27th day of march 1778 three days before my leaving paris <\s>
<s> it will show that the whole amount of the monies received by the commissioners was 3,753 250 livres and their expenditures 4,046 988 livres 7 sols and by the general state of the account delivered the 12th of october it appears for what those expenditures were made <\s>

<s> i might with safety rest this whole sum on the score of the commissioners expenses for this space of time and support it on mr lee's letter to congress in which he says that mr adams and himself were fully convinced that they could not live at paris under Â £ 3000 sterling or about 70,000 livres each annually <\s>
<s> had the commissioners expended at that rate from february 1777 to march 1778 the whole of the sum would be no more than a sufficiency to supply their expenses but this was not the case <\s>

<s> and 2d instant i take the liberty of applying again to congress to remind them of my situation <\s>
<s> it is now more than twelve months since in obedience to their orders i left france to return to my native country <\s>
<s> having employed the short interval between the receiving advice of my recall and my embarking in soliciting essential aid and succor for these states i entered on my voyage with the pleasing reflection that after a two years faithful service in a most difficult and embarrassed negotiation the issue had been fortunate equal to my utmost wishes that the supplies i had procured and sent out had enabled my brave countrymen and fellow citizens to resist and humble the enemy that the treaty which i had the honor with my colleagues to conclude had engaged one of the most powerful and generous princes in the world to guaranty the liberties and independence of these states <\s>
<s> the great and seasonable aid sent out by him with which after having received the most honorable testimonials of his approbation and even of his esteem as well as that of his ministers and of my late worthy colleague and friend dr franklin i had the honor to embark gave me in prospect the completion of my most sanguine hopes--the total reduction of the british force in north america <\s>
<s> unfortunately the length of our passage defeated the most essential objects of this great and well concerted enterprise <\s>
<s> extensive and important services were however thereby rendered on which i need not be particular <\s>

<s> between my arrival in this city on the 13th of july and my audience before congress on the 21st of august i was informed that the minds of some of my countrymen were prejudiced against me and that insinuations were industriously circulated to effect others i therefore took the earliest opportunity given me and after having laid before congress a general state of foreign affairs and of my proceedings to request that if any thing had been laid to my charge or suggested to my disadvantage i might be made acquainted therewith for that it was probable that in the difficult complicated and embarrassed scenes i had gone through many things might require explanation <\s>
<s> i received no reply and continuing to solicit to have the business i returned upon concluded i was informed that an honorable member produced in congress an extract from a letter from a private gentleman respecting a conversation which passed between him and mr carmichael which implied a censure on my conduct <\s>
<s> on the 26th of september mr secretary thompson acquainted me with the resolution of congress of that day to postpone further consideration of my requests _until the examination of william carmichael <\s>
<s> what the result of that examination was i never knew but having waited some days the urgent necessity for my speedy return pressing on me i applied again and repeatedly that i might finish the business upon which i had been sent for <\s>
<s> days were repeatedly appointed for that purpose and i must suppose business of more importance prevented <\s>
<s> in those letters i laid before congress the unsettled state in which i had by my sudden departure been obliged to leave the accounts and other mercantile transactions of the commissioners and pointed out the injuries which the public must suffer by a delay of their settlement as well as the personal inconveniences i must be subjected to whilst they remained unsettled <\s>
<s> to these letters i beg leave to refer <\s>
<s> in october extracts from letters from mr arthur lee and mr izard were by order of congress delivered me to which i replied at large on the 12th and 22d of the same month my letters are still before congress and to them i refer particularly to that of the 12th which closes in these words as in commercial transactions there are but two sides to an account and every thing goes to the debit or credit the folio for profit or loss so i must solicit that dr franklin and mr adams may be directed to see the settlement of all those accounts immediately on my return to paris and as there has been a charge made by mr lee of profusion of extravagant contracts and the like that those gentlemen be authorised to submit those accounts with every allegation of the kind to the adjustment and determination of gentlemen of ability and character on the spot and that orders may be given that whatever may be found due from the commissioners or either of them may be instantly paid into the hands of the banker for congress and that in like manner said banker may be ordered to pay whatever may be the balance to the person in whose favor the same shall be found <\s>
<s> by this means truth will be demonstrated and justice done which is all i have ever wished for <\s>
<s> in december last i was directed to lay before congress in writing 21 a narrative of my proceedings whilst their commercial and political agent c <\s>
<s> i must ask leave to refer to that narrative at large as many of the honorable members then in congress are now absent and the representatives of several of the states entirely changed <\s>
<s> on a reference it will be found that i again solicited for as early a decision as possible on my conduct that the most thorough examination might be made and to demonstrate what my commercial conduct had been whilst the agent of these states that my accounts might be put in the way of being settled without delay that the part i had acted and the station i had been in could not be considered as a neutral or indifferent one and that approbation or censure was my due c <\s>
<s> when i was favored with that audience i flattered myself that the delays i had met with had given ample time for the most full and perfect scrutiny into every part of my conduct and that if any charges were to be brought against any part of my conduct i should then be informed of them <\s>
<s> i therefore again requested to know if there were any <\s>
<s> i was informed of none <\s>
<s> soon after i was told that a committee was appointed to examine into and report on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> i previously informed congress that i had no copies of the letters written to them by the commissioners from paris that doctor franklin took the care of them and that my having no apprehension of being questioned on them i had not taken duplicates with me therefore requested that i might have copies of them that i might explain anything which might at first sight appear dubious or contradictory <\s>
<s> i afterwards applied to the members of the honorable committee desiring that if in the course of their examination anything should appear doubtful or such as might support a charge against any part of my conduct i might be heard before any report should be made <\s>
<s> i did not receive copies of the letters nor was i ever called upon by the committee who i am informed have made their report as to which i am wholly uninformed <\s>
<s> soon after this report was delivered to congress having been persecuted in the public papers for several months in the most scandalous virulent and licentious manner and accused before the public of crimes of the blackest complexion i again addressed myself to congress and as their servant claimed their protection and that i might be heard in the most public manner or in any other way they thought proper <\s>
<s> this letter of the 30th of march remains unanswered and i now pray the contents of it may be considered <\s>
<s> the part i acted as political agent and commissioner for congress is well known and may be judged of with certainty at this time and the settlement of mine and the commissioners accounts which i have repeatedly solicited will demonstrate what my commercial conduct has been <\s>
<s> if in the commercial i have not acted with prudence and integrity if i have neglected to supply these states with stores to the utmost of my power and have either wasted or embezzled the public monies the interest of the public requires that speedy justice be done and the settlement of the commissioners accounts will at once acquit or condemn me <\s>
<s> if in my political department i have in any instance neglected or betrayed the interests of my country if i have conducted weakly or wickedly or both the public ought to know it and i ought to be punished <\s>
<s> if on the contrary i sacrificed all private considerations and put my life as well as fortune to the hazard to procure relief and assistance for these states from abroad if unsupported by remittances from hence without credit or friends and a stranger to the language and manners of the country i was sent to negotiate in i surmounted every obstacle and in a few months obtained and sent out large supplies if i was assiduous and indefatigable for the space of near two years in france in the commercial as well as political affairs of these states at times even to my personal danger if so far from having embezzled the public monies i neglected my private fortune and received nothing but my necessary expenses whilst transacting this business if a principal share of the political negotiations fell on me and if jointly with my colleagues i brought them to a happy and honorable issue and individually acquired the confidence and esteem of his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as of the nation in general and if at my private solicitations in part after my recall a strong fleet and armament were sent out to the relief of these states if these are facts which they certainly are and the greater part of them long since fully ascertained and the others ascertainable by the settlement of the commissioners accounts which i have from the first requested i flatter myself justice will be done by congress and that the artifices of interested and wicked men will not prevail to delay it and thereby injure the public and their servant more essentially than injustice itself would do <\s>
<s> i therefore with the sensibility of an innocent yet injured man and with the firmness of a free independent citizen ask for justice fully confident that congress will not refuse or delay it <\s>
<s> i owe too much to those great personages who generously patronized and protected me in europe to my countrymen and to myself to suffer my character and conduct to remain longer under any uncertainty <\s>
<s> when the part i acted abroad in the service of these states my recall the circumstances of my return my reception and the delays i have since met with are reviewed i think my case will be found peculiar <\s>
<s> permit me then to repeat that my services have been in two departments political and commercial every thing respecting the first is already well known the closing of the accounts will demonstrate what the latter has been on the first congress is now able to judge justice to the public as well as to myself calls for their determination <\s>
<s> if there are charges against me in either of the characters i have supported i must consider myself entitled to know what they are and to be permitted to answer <\s>
<s> i cannot close this letter without complaining to congress of the abuse i have met with in the public papers from a writer who was lately their confidential servant and who has abused their confidence to deceive and impose on the free citizens of these states and to injure me in the public opinion also of the partial and injurious manner in which i have been treated by others who deeply interested by family and other connexions to support my enemies represent my conduct and the letters written by the commissioners and myself as inconsistent and contradictory whilst i remain deprived of any opportunity to explain them <\s>
<s> my utmost ambition and wishes have ever been to serve these states and to merit the title of their faithful and approved servant nothing can deprive me of the consciousness of having served faithfully and with integrity <\s>
<s> if my country have no further service for me my first object as well as my duty must be to justify my conduct and to rescue my reputation and character from the injury and abuse of wicked men and to do this i again ask of congress what i consider as my right their decision on my conduct as their servant and if any part thereof is questioned i may be permitted to explain and vindicate the same which i have often said and again repeat the settlement of the commissioners accounts will enable me to do even to mathematical demonstration <\s>
<s> any further delay in my case must have all the consequences of a refusal and as i have ever relied with confidence on the justice of congress and long waited their decision i flatter myself it will no longer be postponed <\s>

<s> permit me to remind you that these clothes were transported from paris and the other places where they were made up to the sea ports at the expense of the commissioners that they cost something more than 34 livres exclusive of the transportation as i am positive the accounts themselves will show <\s>

<s> the great and seasonable aid sent out by him with which after having received the most honorable testimonials of his approbation and even of his esteem as well as that of his ministers and of my late worthy colleague and friend dr franklin i had the honor to embark gave me in prospect the completion of my most sanguine hopes--the total reduction of the british force in north america <\s>
<s> unfortunately the length of our passage defeated the most essential objects of this great and well concerted enterprise <\s>
<s> extensive and important services were however thereby rendered on which i need not be particular <\s>
<s> immediately on my landing in america _i repaired with all possible despatch to congress to inform them of the state of affairs in europe which i had been advised by their resolution was the business i was ordered to return upon <\s>
<s> between my arrival in this city on the 13th of july and my audience before congress on the 21st of august i was informed that the minds of some of my countrymen were prejudiced against me and that insinuations were industriously circulated to effect others i therefore took the earliest opportunity given me and after having laid before congress a general state of foreign affairs and of my proceedings to request that if any thing had been laid to my charge or suggested to my disadvantage i might be made acquainted therewith for that it was probable that in the difficult complicated and embarrassed scenes i had gone through many things might require explanation <\s>
<s> i received no reply and continuing to solicit to have the business i returned upon concluded i was informed that an honorable member produced in congress an extract from a letter from a private gentleman respecting a conversation which passed between him and mr carmichael which implied a censure on my conduct <\s>
<s> on the 26th of september mr secretary thompson acquainted me with the resolution of congress of that day to postpone further consideration of my requests _until the examination of william carmichael <\s>
<s> what the result of that examination was i never knew but having waited some days the urgent necessity for my speedy return pressing on me i applied again and repeatedly that i might finish the business upon which i had been sent for <\s>
<s> days were repeatedly appointed for that purpose and i must suppose business of more importance prevented <\s>
<s> in those letters i laid before congress the unsettled state in which i had by my sudden departure been obliged to leave the accounts and other mercantile transactions of the commissioners and pointed out the injuries which the public must suffer by a delay of their settlement as well as the personal inconveniences i must be subjected to whilst they remained unsettled <\s>
<s> to these letters i beg leave to refer <\s>
<s> in october extracts from letters from mr arthur lee and mr izard were by order of congress delivered me to which i replied at large on the 12th and 22d of the same month my letters are still before congress and to them i refer particularly to that of the 12th which closes in these words as in commercial transactions there are but two sides to an account and every thing goes to the debit or credit the folio for profit or loss so i must solicit that dr franklin and mr adams may be directed to see the settlement of all those accounts immediately on my return to paris and as there has been a charge made by mr lee of profusion of extravagant contracts and the like that those gentlemen be authorised to submit those accounts with every allegation of the kind to the adjustment and determination of gentlemen of ability and character on the spot and that orders may be given that whatever may be found due from the commissioners or either of them may be instantly paid into the hands of the banker for congress and that in like manner said banker may be ordered to pay whatever may be the balance to the person in whose favor the same shall be found <\s>
<s> by this means truth will be demonstrated and justice done which is all i have ever wished for <\s>
<s> in december last i was directed to lay before congress in writing 21 a narrative of my proceedings whilst their commercial and political agent c <\s>
<s> i must ask leave to refer to that narrative at large as many of the honorable members then in congress are now absent and the representatives of several of the states entirely changed <\s>
<s> on a reference it will be found that i again solicited for as early a decision as possible on my conduct that the most thorough examination might be made and to demonstrate what my commercial conduct had been whilst the agent of these states that my accounts might be put in the way of being settled without delay that the part i had acted and the station i had been in could not be considered as a neutral or indifferent one and that approbation or censure was my due c <\s>
<s> when i was favored with that audience i flattered myself that the delays i had met with had given ample time for the most full and perfect scrutiny into every part of my conduct and that if any charges were to be brought against any part of my conduct i should then be informed of them <\s>
<s> i therefore again requested to know if there were any <\s>
<s> i was informed of none <\s>
<s> soon after i was told that a committee was appointed to examine into and report on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> i previously informed congress that i had no copies of the letters written to them by the commissioners from paris that doctor franklin took the care of them and that my having no apprehension of being questioned on them i had not taken duplicates with me therefore requested that i might have copies of them that i might explain anything which might at first sight appear dubious or contradictory <\s>
<s> i afterwards applied to the members of the honorable committee desiring that if in the course of their examination anything should appear doubtful or such as might support a charge against any part of my conduct i might be heard before any report should be made <\s>
<s> i did not receive copies of the letters nor was i ever called upon by the committee who i am informed have made their report as to which i am wholly uninformed <\s>
<s> soon after this report was delivered to congress having been persecuted in the public papers for several months in the most scandalous virulent and licentious manner and accused before the public of crimes of the blackest complexion i again addressed myself to congress and as their servant claimed their protection and that i might be heard in the most public manner or in any other way they thought proper <\s>
<s> this letter of the 30th of march remains unanswered and i now pray the contents of it may be considered <\s>
<s> the part i acted as political agent and commissioner for congress is well known and may be judged of with certainty at this time and the settlement of mine and the commissioners accounts which i have repeatedly solicited will demonstrate what my commercial conduct has been <\s>
<s> if in the commercial i have not acted with prudence and integrity if i have neglected to supply these states with stores to the utmost of my power and have either wasted or embezzled the public monies the interest of the public requires that speedy justice be done and the settlement of the commissioners accounts will at once acquit or condemn me <\s>
<s> if in my political department i have in any instance neglected or betrayed the interests of my country if i have conducted weakly or wickedly or both the public ought to know it and i ought to be punished <\s>
<s> if on the contrary i sacrificed all private considerations and put my life as well as fortune to the hazard to procure relief and assistance for these states from abroad if unsupported by remittances from hence without credit or friends and a stranger to the language and manners of the country i was sent to negotiate in i surmounted every obstacle and in a few months obtained and sent out large supplies if i was assiduous and indefatigable for the space of near two years in france in the commercial as well as political affairs of these states at times even to my personal danger if so far from having embezzled the public monies i neglected my private fortune and received nothing but my necessary expenses whilst transacting this business if a principal share of the political negotiations fell on me and if jointly with my colleagues i brought them to a happy and honorable issue and individually acquired the confidence and esteem of his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as of the nation in general and if at my private solicitations in part after my recall a strong fleet and armament were sent out to the relief of these states if these are facts which they certainly are and the greater part of them long since fully ascertained and the others ascertainable by the settlement of the commissioners accounts which i have from the first requested i flatter myself justice will be done by congress and that the artifices of interested and wicked men will not prevail to delay it and thereby injure the public and their servant more essentially than injustice itself would do <\s>
<s> i therefore with the sensibility of an innocent yet injured man and with the firmness of a free independent citizen ask for justice fully confident that congress will not refuse or delay it <\s>
<s> i owe too much to those great personages who generously patronized and protected me in europe to my countrymen and to myself to suffer my character and conduct to remain longer under any uncertainty <\s>

<s> the circumstances under which i left france in obedience to their orders and with a view of promoting their service in the greatest and most essential manner it is well known rendered it impossible to have the accounts of the commissioners and my own connected immediately with theirs settled and closed so that the vouchers could be procured and brought out with me <\s>
<s> but a few days past between the knowledge of my recall and of my actual setting out on my return <\s>
<s> one condition of sending out the toulon fleet and of my embarking in it was that the most profound secrecy should be observed and the greatest despatch made <\s>
<s> the king's ministers did not think fit to communicate this secret to my colleague mr lee nor did they leave me at liberty to do it i had as little grounds for confidence in that gentleman as the ministers had and it is evident from their letters and declarations that they never had any <\s>

<s> thus situated i can but appeal once more to the justice of congress and remind them that i brought with me and delivered them it is now more than seven months since an account from under the banker's hands of all the monies received and paid out by him and to whom paid that in my letter of the 12th of october i explained to congress for what purposes those payments were made and in my answers to mr lee's objections to these contracts that i proved him to have been acquainted with them and that he signed himself the orders for the money for the greater part of them <\s>

<s> that account commences in february 1777 and ends the 27th day of march 1778 three days before my leaving paris <\s>
<s> it will show that the whole amount of the monies received by the commissioners was 3,753 250 livres and their expenditures 4,046 988 livres 7 sols and by the general state of the account delivered the 12th of october it appears for what those expenditures were made <\s>

<s> had the commissioners expended at that rate from february 1777 to march 1778 the whole of the sum would be no more than a sufficiency to supply their expenses but this was not the case <\s>

<s> the great and seasonable aid sent out by him with which after having received the most honorable testimonials of his approbation and even of his esteem as well as that of his ministers and of my late worthy colleague and friend dr franklin i had the honor to embark gave me in prospect the completion of my most sanguine hopes--the total reduction of the british force in north america <\s>

<s> i received no reply and continuing to solicit to have the business i returned upon concluded i was informed that an honorable member produced in congress an extract from a letter from a private gentleman respecting a conversation which passed between him and mr carmichael which implied a censure on my conduct <\s>

<s> sir i was this day surprised to hear that in a memorial you had presented to congress you had said that the suits of clothes furnished by messrs sabbatier and desprez ought not to cost or did not cost more than 32 or 34 livres each delivered in the ports of france <\s>
<s> permit me to remind you that these clothes were transported from paris and the other places where they were made up to the sea ports at the expense of the commissioners that they cost something more than 34 livres exclusive of the transportation as i am positive the accounts themselves will show <\s>

<s> monthieu a trifle more and those from m <\s>

<s> i spoke totally from memory and believe i have made a mistake by taking the price in paris or montpellier for the price at which they would stand at the sea ports <\s>

<s> sir in my letter of monday last i mentioned my intention to leave town in the course of the week <\s>
<s> i am now waiting for no other purpose but to know if congress will take notice of the requests i have so often troubled them with <\s>
<s> the circumstances under which i left france in obedience to their orders and with a view of promoting their service in the greatest and most essential manner it is well known rendered it impossible to have the accounts of the commissioners and my own connected immediately with theirs settled and closed so that the vouchers could be procured and brought out with me <\s>
<s> but a few days past between the knowledge of my recall and of my actual setting out on my return <\s>
<s> one condition of sending out the toulon fleet and of my embarking in it was that the most profound secrecy should be observed and the greatest despatch made <\s>
<s> the king's ministers did not think fit to communicate this secret to my colleague mr lee nor did they leave me at liberty to do it i had as little grounds for confidence in that gentleman as the ministers had and it is evident from their letters and declarations that they never had any <\s>
<s> yet such is my peculiar situation that i find myself blamed and censured by many in congress as well as out for not having performed an impossibility and am represented as a defaulter and as having misapplied or embezzled the public monies at once to prevent my future usefulness to my country and to the ruin of my private fortune and character <\s>
<s> thus situated i can but appeal once more to the justice of congress and remind them that i brought with me and delivered them it is now more than seven months since an account from under the banker's hands of all the monies received and paid out by him and to whom paid that in my letter of the 12th of october i explained to congress for what purposes those payments were made and in my answers to mr lee's objections to these contracts that i proved him to have been acquainted with them and that he signed himself the orders for the money for the greater part of them <\s>
<s> i am informed by several honorable gentlemen in congress that many of the members from their absence at the time or from their taking their seats since the delivering in of that account and my letter of the 12th of october are to this moment uninformed of either <\s>

<s> that account commences in february 1777 and ends the 27th day of march 1778 three days before my leaving paris <\s>
<s> it will show that the whole amount of the monies received by the commissioners was 3,753 250 livres and their expenditures 4,046 988 livres 7 sols and by the general state of the account delivered the 12th of october it appears for what those expenditures were made <\s>

<s> and 2d instant i take the liberty of applying again to congress to remind them of my situation <\s>
<s> it is now more than twelve months since in obedience to their orders i left france to return to my native country <\s>
<s> having employed the short interval between the receiving advice of my recall and my embarking in soliciting essential aid and succor for these states i entered on my voyage with the pleasing reflection that after a two years faithful service in a most difficult and embarrassed negotiation the issue had been fortunate equal to my utmost wishes that the supplies i had procured and sent out had enabled my brave countrymen and fellow citizens to resist and humble the enemy that the treaty which i had the honor with my colleagues to conclude had engaged one of the most powerful and generous princes in the world to guaranty the liberties and independence of these states <\s>
<s> the great and seasonable aid sent out by him with which after having received the most honorable testimonials of his approbation and even of his esteem as well as that of his ministers and of my late worthy colleague and friend dr franklin i had the honor to embark gave me in prospect the completion of my most sanguine hopes--the total reduction of the british force in north america <\s>
<s> unfortunately the length of our passage defeated the most essential objects of this great and well concerted enterprise <\s>
<s> extensive and important services were however thereby rendered on which i need not be particular <\s>
<s> immediately on my landing in america _i repaired with all possible despatch to congress to inform them of the state of affairs in europe which i had been advised by their resolution was the business i was ordered to return upon <\s>
<s> between my arrival in this city on the 13th of july and my audience before congress on the 21st of august i was informed that the minds of some of my countrymen were prejudiced against me and that insinuations were industriously circulated to effect others i therefore took the earliest opportunity given me and after having laid before congress a general state of foreign affairs and of my proceedings to request that if any thing had been laid to my charge or suggested to my disadvantage i might be made acquainted therewith for that it was probable that in the difficult complicated and embarrassed scenes i had gone through many things might require explanation <\s>
<s> i received no reply and continuing to solicit to have the business i returned upon concluded i was informed that an honorable member produced in congress an extract from a letter from a private gentleman respecting a conversation which passed between him and mr carmichael which implied a censure on my conduct <\s>
<s> on the 26th of september mr secretary thompson acquainted me with the resolution of congress of that day to postpone further consideration of my requests _until the examination of william carmichael <\s>
<s> what the result of that examination was i never knew but having waited some days the urgent necessity for my speedy return pressing on me i applied again and repeatedly that i might finish the business upon which i had been sent for <\s>
<s> days were repeatedly appointed for that purpose and i must suppose business of more importance prevented <\s>
<s> in those letters i laid before congress the unsettled state in which i had by my sudden departure been obliged to leave the accounts and other mercantile transactions of the commissioners and pointed out the injuries which the public must suffer by a delay of their settlement as well as the personal inconveniences i must be subjected to whilst they remained unsettled <\s>
<s> to these letters i beg leave to refer <\s>
<s> in october extracts from letters from mr arthur lee and mr izard were by order of congress delivered me to which i replied at large on the 12th and 22d of the same month my letters are still before congress and to them i refer particularly to that of the 12th which closes in these words as in commercial transactions there are but two sides to an account and every thing goes to the debit or credit the folio for profit or loss so i must solicit that dr franklin and mr adams may be directed to see the settlement of all those accounts immediately on my return to paris and as there has been a charge made by mr lee of profusion of extravagant contracts and the like that those gentlemen be authorised to submit those accounts with every allegation of the kind to the adjustment and determination of gentlemen of ability and character on the spot and that orders may be given that whatever may be found due from the commissioners or either of them may be instantly paid into the hands of the banker for congress and that in like manner said banker may be ordered to pay whatever may be the balance to the person in whose favor the same shall be found <\s>
<s> by this means truth will be demonstrated and justice done which is all i have ever wished for <\s>
<s> in december last i was directed to lay before congress in writing 21 a narrative of my proceedings whilst their commercial and political agent c <\s>
<s> i must ask leave to refer to that narrative at large as many of the honorable members then in congress are now absent and the representatives of several of the states entirely changed <\s>
<s> on a reference it will be found that i again solicited for as early a decision as possible on my conduct that the most thorough examination might be made and to demonstrate what my commercial conduct had been whilst the agent of these states that my accounts might be put in the way of being settled without delay that the part i had acted and the station i had been in could not be considered as a neutral or indifferent one and that approbation or censure was my due c <\s>
<s> when i was favored with that audience i flattered myself that the delays i had met with had given ample time for the most full and perfect scrutiny into every part of my conduct and that if any charges were to be brought against any part of my conduct i should then be informed of them <\s>
<s> i therefore again requested to know if there were any <\s>
<s> i was informed of none <\s>
<s> soon after i was told that a committee was appointed to examine into and report on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> i previously informed congress that i had no copies of the letters written to them by the commissioners from paris that doctor franklin took the care of them and that my having no apprehension of being questioned on them i had not taken duplicates with me therefore requested that i might have copies of them that i might explain anything which might at first sight appear dubious or contradictory <\s>
<s> i afterwards applied to the members of the honorable committee desiring that if in the course of their examination anything should appear doubtful or such as might support a charge against any part of my conduct i might be heard before any report should be made <\s>
<s> i did not receive copies of the letters nor was i ever called upon by the committee who i am informed have made their report as to which i am wholly uninformed <\s>
<s> soon after this report was delivered to congress having been persecuted in the public papers for several months in the most scandalous virulent and licentious manner and accused before the public of crimes of the blackest complexion i again addressed myself to congress and as their servant claimed their protection and that i might be heard in the most public manner or in any other way they thought proper <\s>
<s> this letter of the 30th of march remains unanswered and i now pray the contents of it may be considered <\s>
<s> the part i acted as political agent and commissioner for congress is well known and may be judged of with certainty at this time and the settlement of mine and the commissioners accounts which i have repeatedly solicited will demonstrate what my commercial conduct has been <\s>
<s> if in the commercial i have not acted with prudence and integrity if i have neglected to supply these states with stores to the utmost of my power and have either wasted or embezzled the public monies the interest of the public requires that speedy justice be done and the settlement of the commissioners accounts will at once acquit or condemn me <\s>
<s> if in my political department i have in any instance neglected or betrayed the interests of my country if i have conducted weakly or wickedly or both the public ought to know it and i ought to be punished <\s>
<s> if on the contrary i sacrificed all private considerations and put my life as well as fortune to the hazard to procure relief and assistance for these states from abroad if unsupported by remittances from hence without credit or friends and a stranger to the language and manners of the country i was sent to negotiate in i surmounted every obstacle and in a few months obtained and sent out large supplies if i was assiduous and indefatigable for the space of near two years in france in the commercial as well as political affairs of these states at times even to my personal danger if so far from having embezzled the public monies i neglected my private fortune and received nothing but my necessary expenses whilst transacting this business if a principal share of the political negotiations fell on me and if jointly with my colleagues i brought them to a happy and honorable issue and individually acquired the confidence and esteem of his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as of the nation in general and if at my private solicitations in part after my recall a strong fleet and armament were sent out to the relief of these states if these are facts which they certainly are and the greater part of them long since fully ascertained and the others ascertainable by the settlement of the commissioners accounts which i have from the first requested i flatter myself justice will be done by congress and that the artifices of interested and wicked men will not prevail to delay it and thereby injure the public and their servant more essentially than injustice itself would do <\s>
<s> i therefore with the sensibility of an innocent yet injured man and with the firmness of a free independent citizen ask for justice fully confident that congress will not refuse or delay it <\s>
<s> i owe too much to those great personages who generously patronized and protected me in europe to my countrymen and to myself to suffer my character and conduct to remain longer under any uncertainty <\s>
<s> when the part i acted abroad in the service of these states my recall the circumstances of my return my reception and the delays i have since met with are reviewed i think my case will be found peculiar <\s>
<s> permit me then to repeat that my services have been in two departments political and commercial every thing respecting the first is already well known the closing of the accounts will demonstrate what the latter has been on the first congress is now able to judge justice to the public as well as to myself calls for their determination <\s>
<s> if there are charges against me in either of the characters i have supported i must consider myself entitled to know what they are and to be permitted to answer <\s>
<s> i cannot close this letter without complaining to congress of the abuse i have met with in the public papers from a writer who was lately their confidential servant and who has abused their confidence to deceive and impose on the free citizens of these states and to injure me in the public opinion also of the partial and injurious manner in which i have been treated by others who deeply interested by family and other connexions to support my enemies represent my conduct and the letters written by the commissioners and myself as inconsistent and contradictory whilst i remain deprived of any opportunity to explain them <\s>
<s> my utmost ambition and wishes have ever been to serve these states and to merit the title of their faithful and approved servant nothing can deprive me of the consciousness of having served faithfully and with integrity <\s>
<s> if my country have no further service for me my first object as well as my duty must be to justify my conduct and to rescue my reputation and character from the injury and abuse of wicked men and to do this i again ask of congress what i consider as my right their decision on my conduct as their servant and if any part thereof is questioned i may be permitted to explain and vindicate the same which i have often said and again repeat the settlement of the commissioners accounts will enable me to do even to mathematical demonstration <\s>
<s> any further delay in my case must have all the consequences of a refusal and as i have ever relied with confidence on the justice of congress and long waited their decision i flatter myself it will no longer be postponed <\s>

<s> having employed the short interval between the receiving advice of my recall and my embarking in soliciting essential aid and succor for these states i entered on my voyage with the pleasing reflection that after a two years faithful service in a most difficult and embarrassed negotiation the issue had been fortunate equal to my utmost wishes that the supplies i had procured and sent out had enabled my brave countrymen and fellow citizens to resist and humble the enemy that the treaty which i had the honor with my colleagues to conclude had engaged one of the most powerful and generous princes in the world to guaranty the liberties and independence of these states <\s>
<s> the great and seasonable aid sent out by him with which after having received the most honorable testimonials of his approbation and even of his esteem as well as that of his ministers and of my late worthy colleague and friend dr franklin i had the honor to embark gave me in prospect the completion of my most sanguine hopes--the total reduction of the british force in north america <\s>
<s> unfortunately the length of our passage defeated the most essential objects of this great and well concerted enterprise <\s>

<s> between my arrival in this city on the 13th of july and my audience before congress on the 21st of august i was informed that the minds of some of my countrymen were prejudiced against me and that insinuations were industriously circulated to effect others i therefore took the earliest opportunity given me and after having laid before congress a general state of foreign affairs and of my proceedings to request that if any thing had been laid to my charge or suggested to my disadvantage i might be made acquainted therewith for that it was probable that in the difficult complicated and embarrassed scenes i had gone through many things might require explanation <\s>
<s> i received no reply and continuing to solicit to have the business i returned upon concluded i was informed that an honorable member produced in congress an extract from a letter from a private gentleman respecting a conversation which passed between him and mr carmichael which implied a censure on my conduct <\s>
<s> on the 26th of september mr secretary thompson acquainted me with the resolution of congress of that day to postpone further consideration of my requests _until the examination of william carmichael <\s>
<s> what the result of that examination was i never knew but having waited some days the urgent necessity for my speedy return pressing on me i applied again and repeatedly that i might finish the business upon which i had been sent for <\s>
<s> days were repeatedly appointed for that purpose and i must suppose business of more importance prevented <\s>
<s> in those letters i laid before congress the unsettled state in which i had by my sudden departure been obliged to leave the accounts and other mercantile transactions of the commissioners and pointed out the injuries which the public must suffer by a delay of their settlement as well as the personal inconveniences i must be subjected to whilst they remained unsettled <\s>
<s> to these letters i beg leave to refer <\s>
<s> in october extracts from letters from mr arthur lee and mr izard were by order of congress delivered me to which i replied at large on the 12th and 22d of the same month my letters are still before congress and to them i refer particularly to that of the 12th which closes in these words as in commercial transactions there are but two sides to an account and every thing goes to the debit or credit the folio for profit or loss so i must solicit that dr franklin and mr adams may be directed to see the settlement of all those accounts immediately on my return to paris and as there has been a charge made by mr lee of profusion of extravagant contracts and the like that those gentlemen be authorised to submit those accounts with every allegation of the kind to the adjustment and determination of gentlemen of ability and character on the spot and that orders may be given that whatever may be found due from the commissioners or either of them may be instantly paid into the hands of the banker for congress and that in like manner said banker may be ordered to pay whatever may be the balance to the person in whose favor the same shall be found <\s>
<s> by this means truth will be demonstrated and justice done which is all i have ever wished for <\s>

<s> on a reference it will be found that i again solicited for as early a decision as possible on my conduct that the most thorough examination might be made and to demonstrate what my commercial conduct had been whilst the agent of these states that my accounts might be put in the way of being settled without delay that the part i had acted and the station i had been in could not be considered as a neutral or indifferent one and that approbation or censure was my due c <\s>
<s> when i was favored with that audience i flattered myself that the delays i had met with had given ample time for the most full and perfect scrutiny into every part of my conduct and that if any charges were to be brought against any part of my conduct i should then be informed of them <\s>

<s> to these letters i beg leave to refer <\s>
<s> in october extracts from letters from mr arthur lee and mr izard were by order of congress delivered me to which i replied at large on the 12th and 22d of the same month my letters are still before congress and to them i refer particularly to that of the 12th which closes in these words as in commercial transactions there are but two sides to an account and every thing goes to the debit or credit the folio for profit or loss so i must solicit that dr franklin and mr adams may be directed to see the settlement of all those accounts immediately on my return to paris and as there has been a charge made by mr lee of profusion of extravagant contracts and the like that those gentlemen be authorised to submit those accounts with every allegation of the kind to the adjustment and determination of gentlemen of ability and character on the spot and that orders may be given that whatever may be found due from the commissioners or either of them may be instantly paid into the hands of the banker for congress and that in like manner said banker may be ordered to pay whatever may be the balance to the person in whose favor the same shall be found <\s>

<s> sir in my letter of monday last i mentioned my intention to leave town in the course of the week <\s>
<s> i am now waiting for no other purpose but to know if congress will take notice of the requests i have so often troubled them with <\s>
<s> the circumstances under which i left france in obedience to their orders and with a view of promoting their service in the greatest and most essential manner it is well known rendered it impossible to have the accounts of the commissioners and my own connected immediately with theirs settled and closed so that the vouchers could be procured and brought out with me <\s>
<s> but a few days past between the knowledge of my recall and of my actual setting out on my return <\s>
<s> one condition of sending out the toulon fleet and of my embarking in it was that the most profound secrecy should be observed and the greatest despatch made <\s>
<s> the king's ministers did not think fit to communicate this secret to my colleague mr lee nor did they leave me at liberty to do it i had as little grounds for confidence in that gentleman as the ministers had and it is evident from their letters and declarations that they never had any <\s>
<s> yet such is my peculiar situation that i find myself blamed and censured by many in congress as well as out for not having performed an impossibility and am represented as a defaulter and as having misapplied or embezzled the public monies at once to prevent my future usefulness to my country and to the ruin of my private fortune and character <\s>
<s> thus situated i can but appeal once more to the justice of congress and remind them that i brought with me and delivered them it is now more than seven months since an account from under the banker's hands of all the monies received and paid out by him and to whom paid that in my letter of the 12th of october i explained to congress for what purposes those payments were made and in my answers to mr lee's objections to these contracts that i proved him to have been acquainted with them and that he signed himself the orders for the money for the greater part of them <\s>
<s> i am informed by several honorable gentlemen in congress that many of the members from their absence at the time or from their taking their seats since the delivering in of that account and my letter of the 12th of october are to this moment uninformed of either <\s>

<s> that account commences in february 1777 and ends the 27th day of march 1778 three days before my leaving paris <\s>
<s> it will show that the whole amount of the monies received by the commissioners was 3,753 250 livres and their expenditures 4,046 988 livres 7 sols and by the general state of the account delivered the 12th of october it appears for what those expenditures were made <\s>

<s> 7-1 2 sterling for the commissioners expenses for almost fifteen months and for small purchases and for a variety of services not possible to be particularised without the accounts at large <\s>
<s> i might with safety rest this whole sum on the score of the commissioners expenses for this space of time and support it on mr lee's letter to congress in which he says that mr adams and himself were fully convinced that they could not live at paris under Â £ 3000 sterling or about 70,000 livres each annually <\s>
<s> had the commissioners expended at that rate from february 1777 to march 1778 the whole of the sum would be no more than a sufficiency to supply their expenses but this was not the case <\s>

<s> i spoke totally from memory and believe i have made a mistake by taking the price in paris or montpellier for the price at which they would stand at the sea ports <\s>

<s> sir in my letter of monday last i mentioned my intention to leave town in the course of the week <\s>
<s> i am now waiting for no other purpose but to know if congress will take notice of the requests i have so often troubled them with <\s>
<s> the circumstances under which i left france in obedience to their orders and with a view of promoting their service in the greatest and most essential manner it is well known rendered it impossible to have the accounts of the commissioners and my own connected immediately with theirs settled and closed so that the vouchers could be procured and brought out with me <\s>
<s> but a few days past between the knowledge of my recall and of my actual setting out on my return <\s>
<s> one condition of sending out the toulon fleet and of my embarking in it was that the most profound secrecy should be observed and the greatest despatch made <\s>
<s> the king's ministers did not think fit to communicate this secret to my colleague mr lee nor did they leave me at liberty to do it i had as little grounds for confidence in that gentleman as the ministers had and it is evident from their letters and declarations that they never had any <\s>
<s> yet such is my peculiar situation that i find myself blamed and censured by many in congress as well as out for not having performed an impossibility and am represented as a defaulter and as having misapplied or embezzled the public monies at once to prevent my future usefulness to my country and to the ruin of my private fortune and character <\s>
<s> thus situated i can but appeal once more to the justice of congress and remind them that i brought with me and delivered them it is now more than seven months since an account from under the banker's hands of all the monies received and paid out by him and to whom paid that in my letter of the 12th of october i explained to congress for what purposes those payments were made and in my answers to mr lee's objections to these contracts that i proved him to have been acquainted with them and that he signed himself the orders for the money for the greater part of them <\s>
<s> i am informed by several honorable gentlemen in congress that many of the members from their absence at the time or from their taking their seats since the delivering in of that account and my letter of the 12th of october are to this moment uninformed of either <\s>
<s> this obliges me to refer to them at this time and though i have not the vouchers to support every article yet i will cheerfully put my reputation as a merchant as an honest man and as a frugal servant of the public on the examination of those accounts the circumstances under which they were taken at the same time to be considered <\s>
<s> that account commences in february 1777 and ends the 27th day of march 1778 three days before my leaving paris <\s>
<s> it will show that the whole amount of the monies received by the commissioners was 3,753 250 livres and their expenditures 4,046 988 livres 7 sols and by the general state of the account delivered the 12th of october it appears for what those expenditures were made <\s>

<s> i might with safety rest this whole sum on the score of the commissioners expenses for this space of time and support it on mr lee's letter to congress in which he says that mr adams and himself were fully convinced that they could not live at paris under Â £ 3000 sterling or about 70,000 livres each annually <\s>
<s> had the commissioners expended at that rate from february 1777 to march 1778 the whole of the sum would be no more than a sufficiency to supply their expenses but this was not the case <\s>

<s> and 2d instant i take the liberty of applying again to congress to remind them of my situation <\s>
<s> it is now more than twelve months since in obedience to their orders i left france to return to my native country <\s>
<s> having employed the short interval between the receiving advice of my recall and my embarking in soliciting essential aid and succor for these states i entered on my voyage with the pleasing reflection that after a two years faithful service in a most difficult and embarrassed negotiation the issue had been fortunate equal to my utmost wishes that the supplies i had procured and sent out had enabled my brave countrymen and fellow citizens to resist and humble the enemy that the treaty which i had the honor with my colleagues to conclude had engaged one of the most powerful and generous princes in the world to guaranty the liberties and independence of these states <\s>
<s> the great and seasonable aid sent out by him with which after having received the most honorable testimonials of his approbation and even of his esteem as well as that of his ministers and of my late worthy colleague and friend dr franklin i had the honor to embark gave me in prospect the completion of my most sanguine hopes--the total reduction of the british force in north america <\s>
<s> unfortunately the length of our passage defeated the most essential objects of this great and well concerted enterprise <\s>
<s> extensive and important services were however thereby rendered on which i need not be particular <\s>

<s> between my arrival in this city on the 13th of july and my audience before congress on the 21st of august i was informed that the minds of some of my countrymen were prejudiced against me and that insinuations were industriously circulated to effect others i therefore took the earliest opportunity given me and after having laid before congress a general state of foreign affairs and of my proceedings to request that if any thing had been laid to my charge or suggested to my disadvantage i might be made acquainted therewith for that it was probable that in the difficult complicated and embarrassed scenes i had gone through many things might require explanation <\s>
<s> i received no reply and continuing to solicit to have the business i returned upon concluded i was informed that an honorable member produced in congress an extract from a letter from a private gentleman respecting a conversation which passed between him and mr carmichael which implied a censure on my conduct <\s>
<s> on the 26th of september mr secretary thompson acquainted me with the resolution of congress of that day to postpone further consideration of my requests _until the examination of william carmichael <\s>
<s> what the result of that examination was i never knew but having waited some days the urgent necessity for my speedy return pressing on me i applied again and repeatedly that i might finish the business upon which i had been sent for <\s>
<s> days were repeatedly appointed for that purpose and i must suppose business of more importance prevented <\s>
<s> in those letters i laid before congress the unsettled state in which i had by my sudden departure been obliged to leave the accounts and other mercantile transactions of the commissioners and pointed out the injuries which the public must suffer by a delay of their settlement as well as the personal inconveniences i must be subjected to whilst they remained unsettled <\s>
<s> to these letters i beg leave to refer <\s>
<s> in october extracts from letters from mr arthur lee and mr izard were by order of congress delivered me to which i replied at large on the 12th and 22d of the same month my letters are still before congress and to them i refer particularly to that of the 12th which closes in these words as in commercial transactions there are but two sides to an account and every thing goes to the debit or credit the folio for profit or loss so i must solicit that dr franklin and mr adams may be directed to see the settlement of all those accounts immediately on my return to paris and as there has been a charge made by mr lee of profusion of extravagant contracts and the like that those gentlemen be authorised to submit those accounts with every allegation of the kind to the adjustment and determination of gentlemen of ability and character on the spot and that orders may be given that whatever may be found due from the commissioners or either of them may be instantly paid into the hands of the banker for congress and that in like manner said banker may be ordered to pay whatever may be the balance to the person in whose favor the same shall be found <\s>
<s> by this means truth will be demonstrated and justice done which is all i have ever wished for <\s>
<s> in december last i was directed to lay before congress in writing 21 a narrative of my proceedings whilst their commercial and political agent c <\s>
<s> i must ask leave to refer to that narrative at large as many of the honorable members then in congress are now absent and the representatives of several of the states entirely changed <\s>
<s> on a reference it will be found that i again solicited for as early a decision as possible on my conduct that the most thorough examination might be made and to demonstrate what my commercial conduct had been whilst the agent of these states that my accounts might be put in the way of being settled without delay that the part i had acted and the station i had been in could not be considered as a neutral or indifferent one and that approbation or censure was my due c <\s>
<s> when i was favored with that audience i flattered myself that the delays i had met with had given ample time for the most full and perfect scrutiny into every part of my conduct and that if any charges were to be brought against any part of my conduct i should then be informed of them <\s>
<s> i therefore again requested to know if there were any <\s>
<s> i was informed of none <\s>
<s> soon after i was told that a committee was appointed to examine into and report on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> i previously informed congress that i had no copies of the letters written to them by the commissioners from paris that doctor franklin took the care of them and that my having no apprehension of being questioned on them i had not taken duplicates with me therefore requested that i might have copies of them that i might explain anything which might at first sight appear dubious or contradictory <\s>
<s> i afterwards applied to the members of the honorable committee desiring that if in the course of their examination anything should appear doubtful or such as might support a charge against any part of my conduct i might be heard before any report should be made <\s>
<s> i did not receive copies of the letters nor was i ever called upon by the committee who i am informed have made their report as to which i am wholly uninformed <\s>
<s> soon after this report was delivered to congress having been persecuted in the public papers for several months in the most scandalous virulent and licentious manner and accused before the public of crimes of the blackest complexion i again addressed myself to congress and as their servant claimed their protection and that i might be heard in the most public manner or in any other way they thought proper <\s>
<s> this letter of the 30th of march remains unanswered and i now pray the contents of it may be considered <\s>
<s> the part i acted as political agent and commissioner for congress is well known and may be judged of with certainty at this time and the settlement of mine and the commissioners accounts which i have repeatedly solicited will demonstrate what my commercial conduct has been <\s>
<s> if in the commercial i have not acted with prudence and integrity if i have neglected to supply these states with stores to the utmost of my power and have either wasted or embezzled the public monies the interest of the public requires that speedy justice be done and the settlement of the commissioners accounts will at once acquit or condemn me <\s>
<s> if in my political department i have in any instance neglected or betrayed the interests of my country if i have conducted weakly or wickedly or both the public ought to know it and i ought to be punished <\s>
<s> if on the contrary i sacrificed all private considerations and put my life as well as fortune to the hazard to procure relief and assistance for these states from abroad if unsupported by remittances from hence without credit or friends and a stranger to the language and manners of the country i was sent to negotiate in i surmounted every obstacle and in a few months obtained and sent out large supplies if i was assiduous and indefatigable for the space of near two years in france in the commercial as well as political affairs of these states at times even to my personal danger if so far from having embezzled the public monies i neglected my private fortune and received nothing but my necessary expenses whilst transacting this business if a principal share of the political negotiations fell on me and if jointly with my colleagues i brought them to a happy and honorable issue and individually acquired the confidence and esteem of his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as of the nation in general and if at my private solicitations in part after my recall a strong fleet and armament were sent out to the relief of these states if these are facts which they certainly are and the greater part of them long since fully ascertained and the others ascertainable by the settlement of the commissioners accounts which i have from the first requested i flatter myself justice will be done by congress and that the artifices of interested and wicked men will not prevail to delay it and thereby injure the public and their servant more essentially than injustice itself would do <\s>
<s> i therefore with the sensibility of an innocent yet injured man and with the firmness of a free independent citizen ask for justice fully confident that congress will not refuse or delay it <\s>
<s> i owe too much to those great personages who generously patronized and protected me in europe to my countrymen and to myself to suffer my character and conduct to remain longer under any uncertainty <\s>
<s> when the part i acted abroad in the service of these states my recall the circumstances of my return my reception and the delays i have since met with are reviewed i think my case will be found peculiar <\s>
<s> permit me then to repeat that my services have been in two departments political and commercial every thing respecting the first is already well known the closing of the accounts will demonstrate what the latter has been on the first congress is now able to judge justice to the public as well as to myself calls for their determination <\s>
<s> if there are charges against me in either of the characters i have supported i must consider myself entitled to know what they are and to be permitted to answer <\s>
<s> i cannot close this letter without complaining to congress of the abuse i have met with in the public papers from a writer who was lately their confidential servant and who has abused their confidence to deceive and impose on the free citizens of these states and to injure me in the public opinion also of the partial and injurious manner in which i have been treated by others who deeply interested by family and other connexions to support my enemies represent my conduct and the letters written by the commissioners and myself as inconsistent and contradictory whilst i remain deprived of any opportunity to explain them <\s>
<s> my utmost ambition and wishes have ever been to serve these states and to merit the title of their faithful and approved servant nothing can deprive me of the consciousness of having served faithfully and with integrity <\s>
<s> if my country have no further service for me my first object as well as my duty must be to justify my conduct and to rescue my reputation and character from the injury and abuse of wicked men and to do this i again ask of congress what i consider as my right their decision on my conduct as their servant and if any part thereof is questioned i may be permitted to explain and vindicate the same which i have often said and again repeat the settlement of the commissioners accounts will enable me to do even to mathematical demonstration <\s>
<s> any further delay in my case must have all the consequences of a refusal and as i have ever relied with confidence on the justice of congress and long waited their decision i flatter myself it will no longer be postponed <\s>

<s> permit me to remind you that these clothes were transported from paris and the other places where they were made up to the sea ports at the expense of the commissioners that they cost something more than 34 livres exclusive of the transportation as i am positive the accounts themselves will show <\s>

<s> the great and seasonable aid sent out by him with which after having received the most honorable testimonials of his approbation and even of his esteem as well as that of his ministers and of my late worthy colleague and friend dr franklin i had the honor to embark gave me in prospect the completion of my most sanguine hopes--the total reduction of the british force in north america <\s>
<s> unfortunately the length of our passage defeated the most essential objects of this great and well concerted enterprise <\s>
<s> extensive and important services were however thereby rendered on which i need not be particular <\s>
<s> immediately on my landing in america _i repaired with all possible despatch to congress to inform them of the state of affairs in europe which i had been advised by their resolution was the business i was ordered to return upon <\s>
<s> between my arrival in this city on the 13th of july and my audience before congress on the 21st of august i was informed that the minds of some of my countrymen were prejudiced against me and that insinuations were industriously circulated to effect others i therefore took the earliest opportunity given me and after having laid before congress a general state of foreign affairs and of my proceedings to request that if any thing had been laid to my charge or suggested to my disadvantage i might be made acquainted therewith for that it was probable that in the difficult complicated and embarrassed scenes i had gone through many things might require explanation <\s>
<s> i received no reply and continuing to solicit to have the business i returned upon concluded i was informed that an honorable member produced in congress an extract from a letter from a private gentleman respecting a conversation which passed between him and mr carmichael which implied a censure on my conduct <\s>
<s> on the 26th of september mr secretary thompson acquainted me with the resolution of congress of that day to postpone further consideration of my requests _until the examination of william carmichael <\s>
<s> what the result of that examination was i never knew but having waited some days the urgent necessity for my speedy return pressing on me i applied again and repeatedly that i might finish the business upon which i had been sent for <\s>
<s> days were repeatedly appointed for that purpose and i must suppose business of more importance prevented <\s>
<s> in those letters i laid before congress the unsettled state in which i had by my sudden departure been obliged to leave the accounts and other mercantile transactions of the commissioners and pointed out the injuries which the public must suffer by a delay of their settlement as well as the personal inconveniences i must be subjected to whilst they remained unsettled <\s>
<s> to these letters i beg leave to refer <\s>
<s> in october extracts from letters from mr arthur lee and mr izard were by order of congress delivered me to which i replied at large on the 12th and 22d of the same month my letters are still before congress and to them i refer particularly to that of the 12th which closes in these words as in commercial transactions there are but two sides to an account and every thing goes to the debit or credit the folio for profit or loss so i must solicit that dr franklin and mr adams may be directed to see the settlement of all those accounts immediately on my return to paris and as there has been a charge made by mr lee of profusion of extravagant contracts and the like that those gentlemen be authorised to submit those accounts with every allegation of the kind to the adjustment and determination of gentlemen of ability and character on the spot and that orders may be given that whatever may be found due from the commissioners or either of them may be instantly paid into the hands of the banker for congress and that in like manner said banker may be ordered to pay whatever may be the balance to the person in whose favor the same shall be found <\s>
<s> by this means truth will be demonstrated and justice done which is all i have ever wished for <\s>
<s> in december last i was directed to lay before congress in writing 21 a narrative of my proceedings whilst their commercial and political agent c <\s>
<s> i must ask leave to refer to that narrative at large as many of the honorable members then in congress are now absent and the representatives of several of the states entirely changed <\s>
<s> on a reference it will be found that i again solicited for as early a decision as possible on my conduct that the most thorough examination might be made and to demonstrate what my commercial conduct had been whilst the agent of these states that my accounts might be put in the way of being settled without delay that the part i had acted and the station i had been in could not be considered as a neutral or indifferent one and that approbation or censure was my due c <\s>
<s> when i was favored with that audience i flattered myself that the delays i had met with had given ample time for the most full and perfect scrutiny into every part of my conduct and that if any charges were to be brought against any part of my conduct i should then be informed of them <\s>
<s> i therefore again requested to know if there were any <\s>
<s> i was informed of none <\s>
<s> soon after i was told that a committee was appointed to examine into and report on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> i previously informed congress that i had no copies of the letters written to them by the commissioners from paris that doctor franklin took the care of them and that my having no apprehension of being questioned on them i had not taken duplicates with me therefore requested that i might have copies of them that i might explain anything which might at first sight appear dubious or contradictory <\s>
<s> i afterwards applied to the members of the honorable committee desiring that if in the course of their examination anything should appear doubtful or such as might support a charge against any part of my conduct i might be heard before any report should be made <\s>
<s> i did not receive copies of the letters nor was i ever called upon by the committee who i am informed have made their report as to which i am wholly uninformed <\s>
<s> soon after this report was delivered to congress having been persecuted in the public papers for several months in the most scandalous virulent and licentious manner and accused before the public of crimes of the blackest complexion i again addressed myself to congress and as their servant claimed their protection and that i might be heard in the most public manner or in any other way they thought proper <\s>
<s> this letter of the 30th of march remains unanswered and i now pray the contents of it may be considered <\s>
<s> the part i acted as political agent and commissioner for congress is well known and may be judged of with certainty at this time and the settlement of mine and the commissioners accounts which i have repeatedly solicited will demonstrate what my commercial conduct has been <\s>
<s> if in the commercial i have not acted with prudence and integrity if i have neglected to supply these states with stores to the utmost of my power and have either wasted or embezzled the public monies the interest of the public requires that speedy justice be done and the settlement of the commissioners accounts will at once acquit or condemn me <\s>
<s> if in my political department i have in any instance neglected or betrayed the interests of my country if i have conducted weakly or wickedly or both the public ought to know it and i ought to be punished <\s>
<s> if on the contrary i sacrificed all private considerations and put my life as well as fortune to the hazard to procure relief and assistance for these states from abroad if unsupported by remittances from hence without credit or friends and a stranger to the language and manners of the country i was sent to negotiate in i surmounted every obstacle and in a few months obtained and sent out large supplies if i was assiduous and indefatigable for the space of near two years in france in the commercial as well as political affairs of these states at times even to my personal danger if so far from having embezzled the public monies i neglected my private fortune and received nothing but my necessary expenses whilst transacting this business if a principal share of the political negotiations fell on me and if jointly with my colleagues i brought them to a happy and honorable issue and individually acquired the confidence and esteem of his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as of the nation in general and if at my private solicitations in part after my recall a strong fleet and armament were sent out to the relief of these states if these are facts which they certainly are and the greater part of them long since fully ascertained and the others ascertainable by the settlement of the commissioners accounts which i have from the first requested i flatter myself justice will be done by congress and that the artifices of interested and wicked men will not prevail to delay it and thereby injure the public and their servant more essentially than injustice itself would do <\s>
<s> i therefore with the sensibility of an innocent yet injured man and with the firmness of a free independent citizen ask for justice fully confident that congress will not refuse or delay it <\s>
<s> i owe too much to those great personages who generously patronized and protected me in europe to my countrymen and to myself to suffer my character and conduct to remain longer under any uncertainty <\s>

<s> the circumstances under which i left france in obedience to their orders and with a view of promoting their service in the greatest and most essential manner it is well known rendered it impossible to have the accounts of the commissioners and my own connected immediately with theirs settled and closed so that the vouchers could be procured and brought out with me <\s>
<s> but a few days past between the knowledge of my recall and of my actual setting out on my return <\s>
<s> one condition of sending out the toulon fleet and of my embarking in it was that the most profound secrecy should be observed and the greatest despatch made <\s>
<s> the king's ministers did not think fit to communicate this secret to my colleague mr lee nor did they leave me at liberty to do it i had as little grounds for confidence in that gentleman as the ministers had and it is evident from their letters and declarations that they never had any <\s>

<s> thus situated i can but appeal once more to the justice of congress and remind them that i brought with me and delivered them it is now more than seven months since an account from under the banker's hands of all the monies received and paid out by him and to whom paid that in my letter of the 12th of october i explained to congress for what purposes those payments were made and in my answers to mr lee's objections to these contracts that i proved him to have been acquainted with them and that he signed himself the orders for the money for the greater part of them <\s>

<s> that account commences in february 1777 and ends the 27th day of march 1778 three days before my leaving paris <\s>
<s> it will show that the whole amount of the monies received by the commissioners was 3,753 250 livres and their expenditures 4,046 988 livres 7 sols and by the general state of the account delivered the 12th of october it appears for what those expenditures were made <\s>

<s> had the commissioners expended at that rate from february 1777 to march 1778 the whole of the sum would be no more than a sufficiency to supply their expenses but this was not the case <\s>

<s> the great and seasonable aid sent out by him with which after having received the most honorable testimonials of his approbation and even of his esteem as well as that of his ministers and of my late worthy colleague and friend dr franklin i had the honor to embark gave me in prospect the completion of my most sanguine hopes--the total reduction of the british force in north america <\s>

<s> i received no reply and continuing to solicit to have the business i returned upon concluded i was informed that an honorable member produced in congress an extract from a letter from a private gentleman respecting a conversation which passed between him and mr carmichael which implied a censure on my conduct <\s>

<s> sir i was this day surprised to hear that in a memorial you had presented to congress you had said that the suits of clothes furnished by messrs sabbatier and desprez ought not to cost or did not cost more than 32 or 34 livres each delivered in the ports of france <\s>
<s> permit me to remind you that these clothes were transported from paris and the other places where they were made up to the sea ports at the expense of the commissioners that they cost something more than 34 livres exclusive of the transportation as i am positive the accounts themselves will show <\s>

<s> monthieu a trifle more and those from m <\s>

<s> i spoke totally from memory and believe i have made a mistake by taking the price in paris or montpellier for the price at which they would stand at the sea ports <\s>

<s> sir in my letter of monday last i mentioned my intention to leave town in the course of the week <\s>
<s> i am now waiting for no other purpose but to know if congress will take notice of the requests i have so often troubled them with <\s>
<s> the circumstances under which i left france in obedience to their orders and with a view of promoting their service in the greatest and most essential manner it is well known rendered it impossible to have the accounts of the commissioners and my own connected immediately with theirs settled and closed so that the vouchers could be procured and brought out with me <\s>
<s> but a few days past between the knowledge of my recall and of my actual setting out on my return <\s>
<s> one condition of sending out the toulon fleet and of my embarking in it was that the most profound secrecy should be observed and the greatest despatch made <\s>
<s> the king's ministers did not think fit to communicate this secret to my colleague mr lee nor did they leave me at liberty to do it i had as little grounds for confidence in that gentleman as the ministers had and it is evident from their letters and declarations that they never had any <\s>
<s> yet such is my peculiar situation that i find myself blamed and censured by many in congress as well as out for not having performed an impossibility and am represented as a defaulter and as having misapplied or embezzled the public monies at once to prevent my future usefulness to my country and to the ruin of my private fortune and character <\s>
<s> thus situated i can but appeal once more to the justice of congress and remind them that i brought with me and delivered them it is now more than seven months since an account from under the banker's hands of all the monies received and paid out by him and to whom paid that in my letter of the 12th of october i explained to congress for what purposes those payments were made and in my answers to mr lee's objections to these contracts that i proved him to have been acquainted with them and that he signed himself the orders for the money for the greater part of them <\s>
<s> i am informed by several honorable gentlemen in congress that many of the members from their absence at the time or from their taking their seats since the delivering in of that account and my letter of the 12th of october are to this moment uninformed of either <\s>

<s> that account commences in february 1777 and ends the 27th day of march 1778 three days before my leaving paris <\s>
<s> it will show that the whole amount of the monies received by the commissioners was 3,753 250 livres and their expenditures 4,046 988 livres 7 sols and by the general state of the account delivered the 12th of october it appears for what those expenditures were made <\s>

<s> and 2d instant i take the liberty of applying again to congress to remind them of my situation <\s>
<s> it is now more than twelve months since in obedience to their orders i left france to return to my native country <\s>
<s> having employed the short interval between the receiving advice of my recall and my embarking in soliciting essential aid and succor for these states i entered on my voyage with the pleasing reflection that after a two years faithful service in a most difficult and embarrassed negotiation the issue had been fortunate equal to my utmost wishes that the supplies i had procured and sent out had enabled my brave countrymen and fellow citizens to resist and humble the enemy that the treaty which i had the honor with my colleagues to conclude had engaged one of the most powerful and generous princes in the world to guaranty the liberties and independence of these states <\s>
<s> the great and seasonable aid sent out by him with which after having received the most honorable testimonials of his approbation and even of his esteem as well as that of his ministers and of my late worthy colleague and friend dr franklin i had the honor to embark gave me in prospect the completion of my most sanguine hopes--the total reduction of the british force in north america <\s>
<s> unfortunately the length of our passage defeated the most essential objects of this great and well concerted enterprise <\s>
<s> extensive and important services were however thereby rendered on which i need not be particular <\s>
<s> immediately on my landing in america _i repaired with all possible despatch to congress to inform them of the state of affairs in europe which i had been advised by their resolution was the business i was ordered to return upon <\s>
<s> between my arrival in this city on the 13th of july and my audience before congress on the 21st of august i was informed that the minds of some of my countrymen were prejudiced against me and that insinuations were industriously circulated to effect others i therefore took the earliest opportunity given me and after having laid before congress a general state of foreign affairs and of my proceedings to request that if any thing had been laid to my charge or suggested to my disadvantage i might be made acquainted therewith for that it was probable that in the difficult complicated and embarrassed scenes i had gone through many things might require explanation <\s>
<s> i received no reply and continuing to solicit to have the business i returned upon concluded i was informed that an honorable member produced in congress an extract from a letter from a private gentleman respecting a conversation which passed between him and mr carmichael which implied a censure on my conduct <\s>
<s> on the 26th of september mr secretary thompson acquainted me with the resolution of congress of that day to postpone further consideration of my requests _until the examination of william carmichael <\s>
<s> what the result of that examination was i never knew but having waited some days the urgent necessity for my speedy return pressing on me i applied again and repeatedly that i might finish the business upon which i had been sent for <\s>
<s> days were repeatedly appointed for that purpose and i must suppose business of more importance prevented <\s>
<s> in those letters i laid before congress the unsettled state in which i had by my sudden departure been obliged to leave the accounts and other mercantile transactions of the commissioners and pointed out the injuries which the public must suffer by a delay of their settlement as well as the personal inconveniences i must be subjected to whilst they remained unsettled <\s>
<s> to these letters i beg leave to refer <\s>
<s> in october extracts from letters from mr arthur lee and mr izard were by order of congress delivered me to which i replied at large on the 12th and 22d of the same month my letters are still before congress and to them i refer particularly to that of the 12th which closes in these words as in commercial transactions there are but two sides to an account and every thing goes to the debit or credit the folio for profit or loss so i must solicit that dr franklin and mr adams may be directed to see the settlement of all those accounts immediately on my return to paris and as there has been a charge made by mr lee of profusion of extravagant contracts and the like that those gentlemen be authorised to submit those accounts with every allegation of the kind to the adjustment and determination of gentlemen of ability and character on the spot and that orders may be given that whatever may be found due from the commissioners or either of them may be instantly paid into the hands of the banker for congress and that in like manner said banker may be ordered to pay whatever may be the balance to the person in whose favor the same shall be found <\s>
<s> by this means truth will be demonstrated and justice done which is all i have ever wished for <\s>
<s> in december last i was directed to lay before congress in writing 21 a narrative of my proceedings whilst their commercial and political agent c <\s>
<s> i must ask leave to refer to that narrative at large as many of the honorable members then in congress are now absent and the representatives of several of the states entirely changed <\s>
<s> on a reference it will be found that i again solicited for as early a decision as possible on my conduct that the most thorough examination might be made and to demonstrate what my commercial conduct had been whilst the agent of these states that my accounts might be put in the way of being settled without delay that the part i had acted and the station i had been in could not be considered as a neutral or indifferent one and that approbation or censure was my due c <\s>
<s> when i was favored with that audience i flattered myself that the delays i had met with had given ample time for the most full and perfect scrutiny into every part of my conduct and that if any charges were to be brought against any part of my conduct i should then be informed of them <\s>
<s> i therefore again requested to know if there were any <\s>
<s> i was informed of none <\s>
<s> soon after i was told that a committee was appointed to examine into and report on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> i previously informed congress that i had no copies of the letters written to them by the commissioners from paris that doctor franklin took the care of them and that my having no apprehension of being questioned on them i had not taken duplicates with me therefore requested that i might have copies of them that i might explain anything which might at first sight appear dubious or contradictory <\s>
<s> i afterwards applied to the members of the honorable committee desiring that if in the course of their examination anything should appear doubtful or such as might support a charge against any part of my conduct i might be heard before any report should be made <\s>
<s> i did not receive copies of the letters nor was i ever called upon by the committee who i am informed have made their report as to which i am wholly uninformed <\s>
<s> soon after this report was delivered to congress having been persecuted in the public papers for several months in the most scandalous virulent and licentious manner and accused before the public of crimes of the blackest complexion i again addressed myself to congress and as their servant claimed their protection and that i might be heard in the most public manner or in any other way they thought proper <\s>
<s> this letter of the 30th of march remains unanswered and i now pray the contents of it may be considered <\s>
<s> the part i acted as political agent and commissioner for congress is well known and may be judged of with certainty at this time and the settlement of mine and the commissioners accounts which i have repeatedly solicited will demonstrate what my commercial conduct has been <\s>
<s> if in the commercial i have not acted with prudence and integrity if i have neglected to supply these states with stores to the utmost of my power and have either wasted or embezzled the public monies the interest of the public requires that speedy justice be done and the settlement of the commissioners accounts will at once acquit or condemn me <\s>
<s> if in my political department i have in any instance neglected or betrayed the interests of my country if i have conducted weakly or wickedly or both the public ought to know it and i ought to be punished <\s>
<s> if on the contrary i sacrificed all private considerations and put my life as well as fortune to the hazard to procure relief and assistance for these states from abroad if unsupported by remittances from hence without credit or friends and a stranger to the language and manners of the country i was sent to negotiate in i surmounted every obstacle and in a few months obtained and sent out large supplies if i was assiduous and indefatigable for the space of near two years in france in the commercial as well as political affairs of these states at times even to my personal danger if so far from having embezzled the public monies i neglected my private fortune and received nothing but my necessary expenses whilst transacting this business if a principal share of the political negotiations fell on me and if jointly with my colleagues i brought them to a happy and honorable issue and individually acquired the confidence and esteem of his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as of the nation in general and if at my private solicitations in part after my recall a strong fleet and armament were sent out to the relief of these states if these are facts which they certainly are and the greater part of them long since fully ascertained and the others ascertainable by the settlement of the commissioners accounts which i have from the first requested i flatter myself justice will be done by congress and that the artifices of interested and wicked men will not prevail to delay it and thereby injure the public and their servant more essentially than injustice itself would do <\s>
<s> i therefore with the sensibility of an innocent yet injured man and with the firmness of a free independent citizen ask for justice fully confident that congress will not refuse or delay it <\s>
<s> i owe too much to those great personages who generously patronized and protected me in europe to my countrymen and to myself to suffer my character and conduct to remain longer under any uncertainty <\s>
<s> when the part i acted abroad in the service of these states my recall the circumstances of my return my reception and the delays i have since met with are reviewed i think my case will be found peculiar <\s>
<s> permit me then to repeat that my services have been in two departments political and commercial every thing respecting the first is already well known the closing of the accounts will demonstrate what the latter has been on the first congress is now able to judge justice to the public as well as to myself calls for their determination <\s>
<s> if there are charges against me in either of the characters i have supported i must consider myself entitled to know what they are and to be permitted to answer <\s>
<s> i cannot close this letter without complaining to congress of the abuse i have met with in the public papers from a writer who was lately their confidential servant and who has abused their confidence to deceive and impose on the free citizens of these states and to injure me in the public opinion also of the partial and injurious manner in which i have been treated by others who deeply interested by family and other connexions to support my enemies represent my conduct and the letters written by the commissioners and myself as inconsistent and contradictory whilst i remain deprived of any opportunity to explain them <\s>
<s> my utmost ambition and wishes have ever been to serve these states and to merit the title of their faithful and approved servant nothing can deprive me of the consciousness of having served faithfully and with integrity <\s>
<s> if my country have no further service for me my first object as well as my duty must be to justify my conduct and to rescue my reputation and character from the injury and abuse of wicked men and to do this i again ask of congress what i consider as my right their decision on my conduct as their servant and if any part thereof is questioned i may be permitted to explain and vindicate the same which i have often said and again repeat the settlement of the commissioners accounts will enable me to do even to mathematical demonstration <\s>
<s> any further delay in my case must have all the consequences of a refusal and as i have ever relied with confidence on the justice of congress and long waited their decision i flatter myself it will no longer be postponed <\s>

<s> having employed the short interval between the receiving advice of my recall and my embarking in soliciting essential aid and succor for these states i entered on my voyage with the pleasing reflection that after a two years faithful service in a most difficult and embarrassed negotiation the issue had been fortunate equal to my utmost wishes that the supplies i had procured and sent out had enabled my brave countrymen and fellow citizens to resist and humble the enemy that the treaty which i had the honor with my colleagues to conclude had engaged one of the most powerful and generous princes in the world to guaranty the liberties and independence of these states <\s>
<s> the great and seasonable aid sent out by him with which after having received the most honorable testimonials of his approbation and even of his esteem as well as that of his ministers and of my late worthy colleague and friend dr franklin i had the honor to embark gave me in prospect the completion of my most sanguine hopes--the total reduction of the british force in north america <\s>
<s> unfortunately the length of our passage defeated the most essential objects of this great and well concerted enterprise <\s>

<s> between my arrival in this city on the 13th of july and my audience before congress on the 21st of august i was informed that the minds of some of my countrymen were prejudiced against me and that insinuations were industriously circulated to effect others i therefore took the earliest opportunity given me and after having laid before congress a general state of foreign affairs and of my proceedings to request that if any thing had been laid to my charge or suggested to my disadvantage i might be made acquainted therewith for that it was probable that in the difficult complicated and embarrassed scenes i had gone through many things might require explanation <\s>
<s> i received no reply and continuing to solicit to have the business i returned upon concluded i was informed that an honorable member produced in congress an extract from a letter from a private gentleman respecting a conversation which passed between him and mr carmichael which implied a censure on my conduct <\s>
<s> on the 26th of september mr secretary thompson acquainted me with the resolution of congress of that day to postpone further consideration of my requests _until the examination of william carmichael <\s>
<s> what the result of that examination was i never knew but having waited some days the urgent necessity for my speedy return pressing on me i applied again and repeatedly that i might finish the business upon which i had been sent for <\s>
<s> days were repeatedly appointed for that purpose and i must suppose business of more importance prevented <\s>
<s> in those letters i laid before congress the unsettled state in which i had by my sudden departure been obliged to leave the accounts and other mercantile transactions of the commissioners and pointed out the injuries which the public must suffer by a delay of their settlement as well as the personal inconveniences i must be subjected to whilst they remained unsettled <\s>
<s> to these letters i beg leave to refer <\s>
<s> in october extracts from letters from mr arthur lee and mr izard were by order of congress delivered me to which i replied at large on the 12th and 22d of the same month my letters are still before congress and to them i refer particularly to that of the 12th which closes in these words as in commercial transactions there are but two sides to an account and every thing goes to the debit or credit the folio for profit or loss so i must solicit that dr franklin and mr adams may be directed to see the settlement of all those accounts immediately on my return to paris and as there has been a charge made by mr lee of profusion of extravagant contracts and the like that those gentlemen be authorised to submit those accounts with every allegation of the kind to the adjustment and determination of gentlemen of ability and character on the spot and that orders may be given that whatever may be found due from the commissioners or either of them may be instantly paid into the hands of the banker for congress and that in like manner said banker may be ordered to pay whatever may be the balance to the person in whose favor the same shall be found <\s>
<s> by this means truth will be demonstrated and justice done which is all i have ever wished for <\s>

<s> on a reference it will be found that i again solicited for as early a decision as possible on my conduct that the most thorough examination might be made and to demonstrate what my commercial conduct had been whilst the agent of these states that my accounts might be put in the way of being settled without delay that the part i had acted and the station i had been in could not be considered as a neutral or indifferent one and that approbation or censure was my due c <\s>
<s> when i was favored with that audience i flattered myself that the delays i had met with had given ample time for the most full and perfect scrutiny into every part of my conduct and that if any charges were to be brought against any part of my conduct i should then be informed of them <\s>

<s> to these letters i beg leave to refer <\s>
<s> in october extracts from letters from mr arthur lee and mr izard were by order of congress delivered me to which i replied at large on the 12th and 22d of the same month my letters are still before congress and to them i refer particularly to that of the 12th which closes in these words as in commercial transactions there are but two sides to an account and every thing goes to the debit or credit the folio for profit or loss so i must solicit that dr franklin and mr adams may be directed to see the settlement of all those accounts immediately on my return to paris and as there has been a charge made by mr lee of profusion of extravagant contracts and the like that those gentlemen be authorised to submit those accounts with every allegation of the kind to the adjustment and determination of gentlemen of ability and character on the spot and that orders may be given that whatever may be found due from the commissioners or either of them may be instantly paid into the hands of the banker for congress and that in like manner said banker may be ordered to pay whatever may be the balance to the person in whose favor the same shall be found <\s>

<s> sir in my letter of monday last i mentioned my intention to leave town in the course of the week <\s>
<s> i am now waiting for no other purpose but to know if congress will take notice of the requests i have so often troubled them with <\s>
<s> the circumstances under which i left france in obedience to their orders and with a view of promoting their service in the greatest and most essential manner it is well known rendered it impossible to have the accounts of the commissioners and my own connected immediately with theirs settled and closed so that the vouchers could be procured and brought out with me <\s>
<s> but a few days past between the knowledge of my recall and of my actual setting out on my return <\s>
<s> one condition of sending out the toulon fleet and of my embarking in it was that the most profound secrecy should be observed and the greatest despatch made <\s>
<s> the king's ministers did not think fit to communicate this secret to my colleague mr lee nor did they leave me at liberty to do it i had as little grounds for confidence in that gentleman as the ministers had and it is evident from their letters and declarations that they never had any <\s>
<s> yet such is my peculiar situation that i find myself blamed and censured by many in congress as well as out for not having performed an impossibility and am represented as a defaulter and as having misapplied or embezzled the public monies at once to prevent my future usefulness to my country and to the ruin of my private fortune and character <\s>
<s> thus situated i can but appeal once more to the justice of congress and remind them that i brought with me and delivered them it is now more than seven months since an account from under the banker's hands of all the monies received and paid out by him and to whom paid that in my letter of the 12th of october i explained to congress for what purposes those payments were made and in my answers to mr lee's objections to these contracts that i proved him to have been acquainted with them and that he signed himself the orders for the money for the greater part of them <\s>
<s> i am informed by several honorable gentlemen in congress that many of the members from their absence at the time or from their taking their seats since the delivering in of that account and my letter of the 12th of october are to this moment uninformed of either <\s>

<s> that account commences in february 1777 and ends the 27th day of march 1778 three days before my leaving paris <\s>
<s> it will show that the whole amount of the monies received by the commissioners was 3,753 250 livres and their expenditures 4,046 988 livres 7 sols and by the general state of the account delivered the 12th of october it appears for what those expenditures were made <\s>

<s> 7-1 2 sterling for the commissioners expenses for almost fifteen months and for small purchases and for a variety of services not possible to be particularised without the accounts at large <\s>
<s> i might with safety rest this whole sum on the score of the commissioners expenses for this space of time and support it on mr lee's letter to congress in which he says that mr adams and himself were fully convinced that they could not live at paris under Â £ 3000 sterling or about 70,000 livres each annually <\s>
<s> had the commissioners expended at that rate from february 1777 to march 1778 the whole of the sum would be no more than a sufficiency to supply their expenses but this was not the case <\s>

<s> i spoke totally from memory and believe i have made a mistake by taking the price in paris or montpellier for the price at which they would stand at the sea ports <\s>

<s> sir in my letter of monday last i mentioned my intention to leave town in the course of the week <\s>
<s> i am now waiting for no other purpose but to know if congress will take notice of the requests i have so often troubled them with <\s>
<s> the circumstances under which i left france in obedience to their orders and with a view of promoting their service in the greatest and most essential manner it is well known rendered it impossible to have the accounts of the commissioners and my own connected immediately with theirs settled and closed so that the vouchers could be procured and brought out with me <\s>
<s> but a few days past between the knowledge of my recall and of my actual setting out on my return <\s>
<s> one condition of sending out the toulon fleet and of my embarking in it was that the most profound secrecy should be observed and the greatest despatch made <\s>
<s> the king's ministers did not think fit to communicate this secret to my colleague mr lee nor did they leave me at liberty to do it i had as little grounds for confidence in that gentleman as the ministers had and it is evident from their letters and declarations that they never had any <\s>
<s> yet such is my peculiar situation that i find myself blamed and censured by many in congress as well as out for not having performed an impossibility and am represented as a defaulter and as having misapplied or embezzled the public monies at once to prevent my future usefulness to my country and to the ruin of my private fortune and character <\s>
<s> thus situated i can but appeal once more to the justice of congress and remind them that i brought with me and delivered them it is now more than seven months since an account from under the banker's hands of all the monies received and paid out by him and to whom paid that in my letter of the 12th of october i explained to congress for what purposes those payments were made and in my answers to mr lee's objections to these contracts that i proved him to have been acquainted with them and that he signed himself the orders for the money for the greater part of them <\s>
<s> i am informed by several honorable gentlemen in congress that many of the members from their absence at the time or from their taking their seats since the delivering in of that account and my letter of the 12th of october are to this moment uninformed of either <\s>
<s> this obliges me to refer to them at this time and though i have not the vouchers to support every article yet i will cheerfully put my reputation as a merchant as an honest man and as a frugal servant of the public on the examination of those accounts the circumstances under which they were taken at the same time to be considered <\s>
<s> that account commences in february 1777 and ends the 27th day of march 1778 three days before my leaving paris <\s>
<s> it will show that the whole amount of the monies received by the commissioners was 3,753 250 livres and their expenditures 4,046 988 livres 7 sols and by the general state of the account delivered the 12th of october it appears for what those expenditures were made <\s>

<s> i might with safety rest this whole sum on the score of the commissioners expenses for this space of time and support it on mr lee's letter to congress in which he says that mr adams and himself were fully convinced that they could not live at paris under Â £ 3000 sterling or about 70,000 livres each annually <\s>
<s> had the commissioners expended at that rate from february 1777 to march 1778 the whole of the sum would be no more than a sufficiency to supply their expenses but this was not the case <\s>

<s> and 2d instant i take the liberty of applying again to congress to remind them of my situation <\s>
<s> it is now more than twelve months since in obedience to their orders i left france to return to my native country <\s>
<s> having employed the short interval between the receiving advice of my recall and my embarking in soliciting essential aid and succor for these states i entered on my voyage with the pleasing reflection that after a two years faithful service in a most difficult and embarrassed negotiation the issue had been fortunate equal to my utmost wishes that the supplies i had procured and sent out had enabled my brave countrymen and fellow citizens to resist and humble the enemy that the treaty which i had the honor with my colleagues to conclude had engaged one of the most powerful and generous princes in the world to guaranty the liberties and independence of these states <\s>
<s> the great and seasonable aid sent out by him with which after having received the most honorable testimonials of his approbation and even of his esteem as well as that of his ministers and of my late worthy colleague and friend dr franklin i had the honor to embark gave me in prospect the completion of my most sanguine hopes--the total reduction of the british force in north america <\s>
<s> unfortunately the length of our passage defeated the most essential objects of this great and well concerted enterprise <\s>
<s> extensive and important services were however thereby rendered on which i need not be particular <\s>

<s> between my arrival in this city on the 13th of july and my audience before congress on the 21st of august i was informed that the minds of some of my countrymen were prejudiced against me and that insinuations were industriously circulated to effect others i therefore took the earliest opportunity given me and after having laid before congress a general state of foreign affairs and of my proceedings to request that if any thing had been laid to my charge or suggested to my disadvantage i might be made acquainted therewith for that it was probable that in the difficult complicated and embarrassed scenes i had gone through many things might require explanation <\s>
<s> i received no reply and continuing to solicit to have the business i returned upon concluded i was informed that an honorable member produced in congress an extract from a letter from a private gentleman respecting a conversation which passed between him and mr carmichael which implied a censure on my conduct <\s>
<s> on the 26th of september mr secretary thompson acquainted me with the resolution of congress of that day to postpone further consideration of my requests _until the examination of william carmichael <\s>
<s> what the result of that examination was i never knew but having waited some days the urgent necessity for my speedy return pressing on me i applied again and repeatedly that i might finish the business upon which i had been sent for <\s>
<s> days were repeatedly appointed for that purpose and i must suppose business of more importance prevented <\s>
<s> in those letters i laid before congress the unsettled state in which i had by my sudden departure been obliged to leave the accounts and other mercantile transactions of the commissioners and pointed out the injuries which the public must suffer by a delay of their settlement as well as the personal inconveniences i must be subjected to whilst they remained unsettled <\s>
<s> to these letters i beg leave to refer <\s>
<s> in october extracts from letters from mr arthur lee and mr izard were by order of congress delivered me to which i replied at large on the 12th and 22d of the same month my letters are still before congress and to them i refer particularly to that of the 12th which closes in these words as in commercial transactions there are but two sides to an account and every thing goes to the debit or credit the folio for profit or loss so i must solicit that dr franklin and mr adams may be directed to see the settlement of all those accounts immediately on my return to paris and as there has been a charge made by mr lee of profusion of extravagant contracts and the like that those gentlemen be authorised to submit those accounts with every allegation of the kind to the adjustment and determination of gentlemen of ability and character on the spot and that orders may be given that whatever may be found due from the commissioners or either of them may be instantly paid into the hands of the banker for congress and that in like manner said banker may be ordered to pay whatever may be the balance to the person in whose favor the same shall be found <\s>
<s> by this means truth will be demonstrated and justice done which is all i have ever wished for <\s>
<s> in december last i was directed to lay before congress in writing 21 a narrative of my proceedings whilst their commercial and political agent c <\s>
<s> i must ask leave to refer to that narrative at large as many of the honorable members then in congress are now absent and the representatives of several of the states entirely changed <\s>
<s> on a reference it will be found that i again solicited for as early a decision as possible on my conduct that the most thorough examination might be made and to demonstrate what my commercial conduct had been whilst the agent of these states that my accounts might be put in the way of being settled without delay that the part i had acted and the station i had been in could not be considered as a neutral or indifferent one and that approbation or censure was my due c <\s>
<s> when i was favored with that audience i flattered myself that the delays i had met with had given ample time for the most full and perfect scrutiny into every part of my conduct and that if any charges were to be brought against any part of my conduct i should then be informed of them <\s>
<s> i therefore again requested to know if there were any <\s>
<s> i was informed of none <\s>
<s> soon after i was told that a committee was appointed to examine into and report on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> i previously informed congress that i had no copies of the letters written to them by the commissioners from paris that doctor franklin took the care of them and that my having no apprehension of being questioned on them i had not taken duplicates with me therefore requested that i might have copies of them that i might explain anything which might at first sight appear dubious or contradictory <\s>
<s> i afterwards applied to the members of the honorable committee desiring that if in the course of their examination anything should appear doubtful or such as might support a charge against any part of my conduct i might be heard before any report should be made <\s>
<s> i did not receive copies of the letters nor was i ever called upon by the committee who i am informed have made their report as to which i am wholly uninformed <\s>
<s> soon after this report was delivered to congress having been persecuted in the public papers for several months in the most scandalous virulent and licentious manner and accused before the public of crimes of the blackest complexion i again addressed myself to congress and as their servant claimed their protection and that i might be heard in the most public manner or in any other way they thought proper <\s>
<s> this letter of the 30th of march remains unanswered and i now pray the contents of it may be considered <\s>
<s> the part i acted as political agent and commissioner for congress is well known and may be judged of with certainty at this time and the settlement of mine and the commissioners accounts which i have repeatedly solicited will demonstrate what my commercial conduct has been <\s>
<s> if in the commercial i have not acted with prudence and integrity if i have neglected to supply these states with stores to the utmost of my power and have either wasted or embezzled the public monies the interest of the public requires that speedy justice be done and the settlement of the commissioners accounts will at once acquit or condemn me <\s>
<s> if in my political department i have in any instance neglected or betrayed the interests of my country if i have conducted weakly or wickedly or both the public ought to know it and i ought to be punished <\s>
<s> if on the contrary i sacrificed all private considerations and put my life as well as fortune to the hazard to procure relief and assistance for these states from abroad if unsupported by remittances from hence without credit or friends and a stranger to the language and manners of the country i was sent to negotiate in i surmounted every obstacle and in a few months obtained and sent out large supplies if i was assiduous and indefatigable for the space of near two years in france in the commercial as well as political affairs of these states at times even to my personal danger if so far from having embezzled the public monies i neglected my private fortune and received nothing but my necessary expenses whilst transacting this business if a principal share of the political negotiations fell on me and if jointly with my colleagues i brought them to a happy and honorable issue and individually acquired the confidence and esteem of his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as of the nation in general and if at my private solicitations in part after my recall a strong fleet and armament were sent out to the relief of these states if these are facts which they certainly are and the greater part of them long since fully ascertained and the others ascertainable by the settlement of the commissioners accounts which i have from the first requested i flatter myself justice will be done by congress and that the artifices of interested and wicked men will not prevail to delay it and thereby injure the public and their servant more essentially than injustice itself would do <\s>
<s> i therefore with the sensibility of an innocent yet injured man and with the firmness of a free independent citizen ask for justice fully confident that congress will not refuse or delay it <\s>
<s> i owe too much to those great personages who generously patronized and protected me in europe to my countrymen and to myself to suffer my character and conduct to remain longer under any uncertainty <\s>
<s> when the part i acted abroad in the service of these states my recall the circumstances of my return my reception and the delays i have since met with are reviewed i think my case will be found peculiar <\s>
<s> permit me then to repeat that my services have been in two departments political and commercial every thing respecting the first is already well known the closing of the accounts will demonstrate what the latter has been on the first congress is now able to judge justice to the public as well as to myself calls for their determination <\s>
<s> if there are charges against me in either of the characters i have supported i must consider myself entitled to know what they are and to be permitted to answer <\s>
<s> i cannot close this letter without complaining to congress of the abuse i have met with in the public papers from a writer who was lately their confidential servant and who has abused their confidence to deceive and impose on the free citizens of these states and to injure me in the public opinion also of the partial and injurious manner in which i have been treated by others who deeply interested by family and other connexions to support my enemies represent my conduct and the letters written by the commissioners and myself as inconsistent and contradictory whilst i remain deprived of any opportunity to explain them <\s>
<s> my utmost ambition and wishes have ever been to serve these states and to merit the title of their faithful and approved servant nothing can deprive me of the consciousness of having served faithfully and with integrity <\s>
<s> if my country have no further service for me my first object as well as my duty must be to justify my conduct and to rescue my reputation and character from the injury and abuse of wicked men and to do this i again ask of congress what i consider as my right their decision on my conduct as their servant and if any part thereof is questioned i may be permitted to explain and vindicate the same which i have often said and again repeat the settlement of the commissioners accounts will enable me to do even to mathematical demonstration <\s>
<s> any further delay in my case must have all the consequences of a refusal and as i have ever relied with confidence on the justice of congress and long waited their decision i flatter myself it will no longer be postponed <\s>

<s> permit me to remind you that these clothes were transported from paris and the other places where they were made up to the sea ports at the expense of the commissioners that they cost something more than 34 livres exclusive of the transportation as i am positive the accounts themselves will show <\s>

<s> the great and seasonable aid sent out by him with which after having received the most honorable testimonials of his approbation and even of his esteem as well as that of his ministers and of my late worthy colleague and friend dr franklin i had the honor to embark gave me in prospect the completion of my most sanguine hopes--the total reduction of the british force in north america <\s>
<s> unfortunately the length of our passage defeated the most essential objects of this great and well concerted enterprise <\s>
<s> extensive and important services were however thereby rendered on which i need not be particular <\s>
<s> immediately on my landing in america _i repaired with all possible despatch to congress to inform them of the state of affairs in europe which i had been advised by their resolution was the business i was ordered to return upon <\s>
<s> between my arrival in this city on the 13th of july and my audience before congress on the 21st of august i was informed that the minds of some of my countrymen were prejudiced against me and that insinuations were industriously circulated to effect others i therefore took the earliest opportunity given me and after having laid before congress a general state of foreign affairs and of my proceedings to request that if any thing had been laid to my charge or suggested to my disadvantage i might be made acquainted therewith for that it was probable that in the difficult complicated and embarrassed scenes i had gone through many things might require explanation <\s>
<s> i received no reply and continuing to solicit to have the business i returned upon concluded i was informed that an honorable member produced in congress an extract from a letter from a private gentleman respecting a conversation which passed between him and mr carmichael which implied a censure on my conduct <\s>
<s> on the 26th of september mr secretary thompson acquainted me with the resolution of congress of that day to postpone further consideration of my requests _until the examination of william carmichael <\s>
<s> what the result of that examination was i never knew but having waited some days the urgent necessity for my speedy return pressing on me i applied again and repeatedly that i might finish the business upon which i had been sent for <\s>
<s> days were repeatedly appointed for that purpose and i must suppose business of more importance prevented <\s>
<s> in those letters i laid before congress the unsettled state in which i had by my sudden departure been obliged to leave the accounts and other mercantile transactions of the commissioners and pointed out the injuries which the public must suffer by a delay of their settlement as well as the personal inconveniences i must be subjected to whilst they remained unsettled <\s>
<s> to these letters i beg leave to refer <\s>
<s> in october extracts from letters from mr arthur lee and mr izard were by order of congress delivered me to which i replied at large on the 12th and 22d of the same month my letters are still before congress and to them i refer particularly to that of the 12th which closes in these words as in commercial transactions there are but two sides to an account and every thing goes to the debit or credit the folio for profit or loss so i must solicit that dr franklin and mr adams may be directed to see the settlement of all those accounts immediately on my return to paris and as there has been a charge made by mr lee of profusion of extravagant contracts and the like that those gentlemen be authorised to submit those accounts with every allegation of the kind to the adjustment and determination of gentlemen of ability and character on the spot and that orders may be given that whatever may be found due from the commissioners or either of them may be instantly paid into the hands of the banker for congress and that in like manner said banker may be ordered to pay whatever may be the balance to the person in whose favor the same shall be found <\s>
<s> by this means truth will be demonstrated and justice done which is all i have ever wished for <\s>
<s> in december last i was directed to lay before congress in writing 21 a narrative of my proceedings whilst their commercial and political agent c <\s>
<s> i must ask leave to refer to that narrative at large as many of the honorable members then in congress are now absent and the representatives of several of the states entirely changed <\s>
<s> on a reference it will be found that i again solicited for as early a decision as possible on my conduct that the most thorough examination might be made and to demonstrate what my commercial conduct had been whilst the agent of these states that my accounts might be put in the way of being settled without delay that the part i had acted and the station i had been in could not be considered as a neutral or indifferent one and that approbation or censure was my due c <\s>
<s> when i was favored with that audience i flattered myself that the delays i had met with had given ample time for the most full and perfect scrutiny into every part of my conduct and that if any charges were to be brought against any part of my conduct i should then be informed of them <\s>
<s> i therefore again requested to know if there were any <\s>
<s> i was informed of none <\s>
<s> soon after i was told that a committee was appointed to examine into and report on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> i previously informed congress that i had no copies of the letters written to them by the commissioners from paris that doctor franklin took the care of them and that my having no apprehension of being questioned on them i had not taken duplicates with me therefore requested that i might have copies of them that i might explain anything which might at first sight appear dubious or contradictory <\s>
<s> i afterwards applied to the members of the honorable committee desiring that if in the course of their examination anything should appear doubtful or such as might support a charge against any part of my conduct i might be heard before any report should be made <\s>
<s> i did not receive copies of the letters nor was i ever called upon by the committee who i am informed have made their report as to which i am wholly uninformed <\s>
<s> soon after this report was delivered to congress having been persecuted in the public papers for several months in the most scandalous virulent and licentious manner and accused before the public of crimes of the blackest complexion i again addressed myself to congress and as their servant claimed their protection and that i might be heard in the most public manner or in any other way they thought proper <\s>
<s> this letter of the 30th of march remains unanswered and i now pray the contents of it may be considered <\s>
<s> the part i acted as political agent and commissioner for congress is well known and may be judged of with certainty at this time and the settlement of mine and the commissioners accounts which i have repeatedly solicited will demonstrate what my commercial conduct has been <\s>
<s> if in the commercial i have not acted with prudence and integrity if i have neglected to supply these states with stores to the utmost of my power and have either wasted or embezzled the public monies the interest of the public requires that speedy justice be done and the settlement of the commissioners accounts will at once acquit or condemn me <\s>
<s> if in my political department i have in any instance neglected or betrayed the interests of my country if i have conducted weakly or wickedly or both the public ought to know it and i ought to be punished <\s>
<s> if on the contrary i sacrificed all private considerations and put my life as well as fortune to the hazard to procure relief and assistance for these states from abroad if unsupported by remittances from hence without credit or friends and a stranger to the language and manners of the country i was sent to negotiate in i surmounted every obstacle and in a few months obtained and sent out large supplies if i was assiduous and indefatigable for the space of near two years in france in the commercial as well as political affairs of these states at times even to my personal danger if so far from having embezzled the public monies i neglected my private fortune and received nothing but my necessary expenses whilst transacting this business if a principal share of the political negotiations fell on me and if jointly with my colleagues i brought them to a happy and honorable issue and individually acquired the confidence and esteem of his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as of the nation in general and if at my private solicitations in part after my recall a strong fleet and armament were sent out to the relief of these states if these are facts which they certainly are and the greater part of them long since fully ascertained and the others ascertainable by the settlement of the commissioners accounts which i have from the first requested i flatter myself justice will be done by congress and that the artifices of interested and wicked men will not prevail to delay it and thereby injure the public and their servant more essentially than injustice itself would do <\s>
<s> i therefore with the sensibility of an innocent yet injured man and with the firmness of a free independent citizen ask for justice fully confident that congress will not refuse or delay it <\s>
<s> i owe too much to those great personages who generously patronized and protected me in europe to my countrymen and to myself to suffer my character and conduct to remain longer under any uncertainty <\s>

<s> in october extracts from letters from mr arthur lee and mr izard were by order of congress delivered me to which i replied at large on the 12th and 22d of the same month my letters are still before congress and to them i refer particularly to that of the 12th which closes in these words as in commercial transactions there are but two sides to an account and every thing goes to the debit or credit the folio for profit or loss so i must solicit that dr franklin and mr adams may be directed to see the settlement of all those accounts immediately on my return to paris and as there has been a charge made by mr lee of profusion of extravagant contracts and the like that those gentlemen be authorised to submit those accounts with every allegation of the kind to the adjustment and determination of gentlemen of ability and character on the spot and that orders may be given that whatever may be found due from the commissioners or either of them may be instantly paid into the hands of the banker for congress and that in like manner said banker may be ordered to pay whatever may be the balance to the person in whose favor the same shall be found <\s>
<s> by this means truth will be demonstrated and justice done which is all i have ever wished for <\s>
<s> in december last i was directed to lay before congress in writing 21 a narrative of my proceedings whilst their commercial and political agent c <\s>
<s> i must ask leave to refer to that narrative at large as many of the honorable members then in congress are now absent and the representatives of several of the states entirely changed <\s>
<s> on a reference it will be found that i again solicited for as early a decision as possible on my conduct that the most thorough examination might be made and to demonstrate what my commercial conduct had been whilst the agent of these states that my accounts might be put in the way of being settled without delay that the part i had acted and the station i had been in could not be considered as a neutral or indifferent one and that approbation or censure was my due c <\s>
<s> when i was favored with that audience i flattered myself that the delays i had met with had given ample time for the most full and perfect scrutiny into every part of my conduct and that if any charges were to be brought against any part of my conduct i should then be informed of them <\s>
<s> i therefore again requested to know if there were any <\s>
<s> i was informed of none <\s>
<s> soon after i was told that a committee was appointed to examine into and report on foreign affairs <\s>
<s> i previously informed congress that i had no copies of the letters written to them by the commissioners from paris that doctor franklin took the care of them and that my having no apprehension of being questioned on them i had not taken duplicates with me therefore requested that i might have copies of them that i might explain anything which might at first sight appear dubious or contradictory <\s>
<s> i afterwards applied to the members of the honorable committee desiring that if in the course of their examination anything should appear doubtful or such as might support a charge against any part of my conduct i might be heard before any report should be made <\s>
<s> i did not receive copies of the letters nor was i ever called upon by the committee who i am informed have made their report as to which i am wholly uninformed <\s>
<s> soon after this report was delivered to congress having been persecuted in the public papers for several months in the most scandalous virulent and licentious manner and accused before the public of crimes of the blackest complexion i again addressed myself to congress and as their servant claimed their protection and that i might be heard in the most public manner or in any other way they thought proper <\s>
<s> this letter of the 30th of march remains unanswered and i now pray the contents of it may be considered <\s>
<s> the part i acted as political agent and commissioner for congress is well known and may be judged of with certainty at this time and the settlement of mine and the commissioners accounts which i have repeatedly solicited will demonstrate what my commercial conduct has been <\s>
<s> if in the commercial i have not acted with prudence and integrity if i have neglected to supply these states with stores to the utmost of my power and have either wasted or embezzled the public monies the interest of the public requires that speedy justice be done and the settlement of the commissioners accounts will at once acquit or condemn me <\s>
<s> if in my political department i have in any instance neglected or betrayed the interests of my country if i have conducted weakly or wickedly or both the public ought to know it and i ought to be punished <\s>
<s> if on the contrary i sacrificed all private considerations and put my life as well as fortune to the hazard to procure relief and assistance for these states from abroad if unsupported by remittances from hence without credit or friends and a stranger to the language and manners of the country i was sent to negotiate in i surmounted every obstacle and in a few months obtained and sent out large supplies if i was assiduous and indefatigable for the space of near two years in france in the commercial as well as political affairs of these states at times even to my personal danger if so far from having embezzled the public monies i neglected my private fortune and received nothing but my necessary expenses whilst transacting this business if a principal share of the political negotiations fell on me and if jointly with my colleagues i brought them to a happy and honorable issue and individually acquired the confidence and esteem of his most christian majesty and his ministers as well as of the nation in general and if at my private solicitations in part after my recall a strong fleet and armament were sent out to the relief of these states if these are facts which they certainly are and the greater part of them long since fully ascertained and the others ascertainable by the settlement of the commissioners accounts which i have from the first requested i flatter myself justice will be done by congress and that the artifices of interested and wicked men will not prevail to delay it and thereby injure the public and their servant more essentially than injustice itself would do <\s>
<s> i therefore with the sensibility of an innocent yet injured man and with the firmness of a free independent citizen ask for justice fully confident that congress will not refuse or delay it <\s>
<s> i owe too much to those great personages who generously patronized and protected me in europe to my countrymen and to myself to suffer my character and conduct to remain longer under any uncertainty <\s>
<s> when the part i acted abroad in the service of these states my recall the circumstances of my return my reception and the delays i have since met with are reviewed i think my case will be found peculiar <\s>
<s> permit me then to repeat that my services have been in two departments political and commercial every thing respecting the first is already well known the closing of the accounts will demonstrate what the latter has been on the first congress is now able to judge justice to the public as well as to myself calls for their determination <\s>
<s> if there are charges against me in either of the characters i have supported i must consider myself entitled to know what they are and to be permitted to answer <\s>
<s> i cannot close this letter without complaining to congress of the abuse i have met with in the public papers from a writer who was lately their confidential servant and who has abused their confidence to deceive and impose on the free citizens of these states and to injure me in the public opinion also of the partial and injurious manner in which i have been treated by others who deeply interested by family and other connexions to support my enemies represent my conduct and the letters written by the commissioners and myself as inconsistent and contradictory whilst i remain deprived of any opportunity to explain them <\s>
<s> my utmost ambition and wishes have ever been to serve these states and to merit the title of their faithful and approved servant nothing can deprive me of the consciousness of having served faithfully and with integrity <\s>
<s> if my country have no further service for me my first object as well as my duty must be to justify my conduct and to rescue my reputation and character from the injury and abuse of wicked men and to do this i again ask of congress what i consider as my right their decision on my conduct as their servant and if any part thereof is questioned i may be permitted to explain and vindicate the same which i have often said and again repeat the settlement of the commissioners accounts will enable me to do even to mathematical demonstration <\s>
<s> any further delay in my case must have all the consequences of a refusal and as i have ever relied with confidence on the justice of congress and long waited their decision i flatter myself it will no longer be postponed <\s>
<s> i shall leave philadelphia in the course of this week on my private affairs and wish to do it as early as possible <\s>

<s> in my narrative i informed congress that the clothes cost 32s <\s>

<s> sir i was this day surprised to hear that in a memorial you had presented to congress you had said that the suits of clothes furnished by messrs sabbatier and desprez ought not to cost or did not cost more than 32 or 34 livres each delivered in the ports of france <\s>
<s> permit me to remind you that these clothes were transported from paris and the other places where they were made up to the sea ports at the expense of the commissioners that they cost something more than 34 livres exclusive of the transportation as i am positive the accounts themselves will show <\s>
<s> i must therefore presume if my information is right that you may be under some mistake as to this matter and therefore pray you if you have the copies of these accounts that you will turn to them which must convince you of it or the error is with me for as i recollect these suits of clothes cost when delivered on board nearest 36 livres on an average and those purchased from mons <\s>
<s> monthieu a trifle more and those from m <\s>
<s> coder which were of a different fashion considerably more this occasioned my saying generally in my narrative to congress that the suits cost 32s <\s>

<s> i spoke totally from memory and believe i have made a mistake by taking the price in paris or montpellier for the price at which they would stand at the sea ports <\s>

<s> sir in my letter of monday last i mentioned my intention to leave town in the course of the week <\s>
<s> i am now waiting for no other purpose but to know if congress will take notice of the requests i have so often troubled them with <\s>
<s> the circumstances under which i left france in obedience to their orders and with a view of promoting their service in the greatest and most essential manner it is well known rendered it impossible to have the accounts of the commissioners and my own connected immediately with theirs settled and closed so that the vouchers could be procured and brought out with me <\s>
<s> but a few days past between the knowledge of my recall and of my actual setting out on my return <\s>
<s> one condition of sending out the toulon fleet and of my embarking in it was that the most profound secrecy should be observed and the greatest despatch made <\s>
<s> the king's ministers did not think fit to communicate this secret to my colleague mr lee nor did they leave me at liberty to do it i had as little grounds for confidence in that gentleman as the ministers had and it is evident from their letters and declarations that they never had any <\s>
<s> yet such is my peculiar situation that i find myself blamed and censured by many in congress as well as out for not having performed an impossibility and am represented as a defaulter and as having misapplied or embezzled the public monies at once to prevent my future usefulness to my country and to the ruin of my private fortune and character <\s>
<s> thus situated i can but appeal once more to the justice of congress and remind them that i brought with me and delivered them it is now more than seven months since an account from under the banker's hands of all the monies received and paid out by him and to whom paid that in my letter of the 12th of october i explained to congress for what purposes those payments were made and in my answers to mr lee's objections to these contracts that i proved him to have been acquainted with them and that he signed himself the orders for the money for the greater part of them <\s>
<s> i am informed by several honorable gentlemen in congress that many of the members from their absence at the time or from their taking their seats since the delivering in of that account and my letter of the 12th of october are to this moment uninformed of either <\s>
<s> this obliges me to refer to them at this time and though i have not the vouchers to support every article yet i will cheerfully put my reputation as a merchant as an honest man and as a frugal servant of the public on the examination of those accounts the circumstances under which they were taken at the same time to be considered <\s>
<s> that account commences in february 1777 and ends the 27th day of march 1778 three days before my leaving paris <\s>
<s> it will show that the whole amount of the monies received by the commissioners was 3,753 250 livres and their expenditures 4,046 988 livres 7 sols and by the general state of the account delivered the 12th of october it appears for what those expenditures were made <\s>
<s> after deducting the sums paid for large contracts for supplies c <\s>
<s> which are particularised there will be left 219,250 livres 1 sol 11 deniers equal to Â £ 9644 <\s>
<s> 7-1 2 sterling for the commissioners expenses for almost fifteen months and for small purchases and for a variety of services not possible to be particularised without the accounts at large <\s>
<s> i might with safety rest this whole sum on the score of the commissioners expenses for this space of time and support it on mr lee's letter to congress in which he says that mr adams and himself were fully convinced that they could not live at paris under Â £ 3000 sterling or about 70,000 livres each annually <\s>
<s> had the commissioners expended at that rate from february 1777 to march 1778 the whole of the sum would be no more than a sufficiency to supply their expenses but this was not the case <\s>
<s> the commissioners in the whole received out of it the sum of 115,480 livres 5 sols 6 deniers for their expenses and private disbursements as will appear by the account enclosed of this dr franklin received 27,841 livres mr lee 52,039 livres 5 sols 9 deniers and myself 35,600 livres <\s>
<s> it is true at the same time that mr lee had in his hands the whole of the money received from spain which he disposed of without the interference of the other commissioners <\s>

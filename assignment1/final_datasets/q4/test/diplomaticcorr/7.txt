<s> had i received proper powers in season this supply would before this have been in america and that under the convoy of a strong fleet the disappointment is distracting and i will dismiss the subject after taking the liberty to which a freeman and an american is entitled of declaring that by this neglect the cause of the united states has suffered in this and the neighboring courts and the blood that will be spilt through the want of these supplies and the devastation if any must be laid at this door <\s>
<s> captain cochran having arrived at nantes i sent to him to come to me <\s>
<s> he is now with me and by him i send this with a packet of letters <\s>
<s> he can inform you of the price of american produce in europe the very advance on which will pay you for fitting out a navy <\s>
<s> rice is from 30 to 50 livres per cwt tobacco 8d and 9d per lb flour and wheat are growing scarce and rising masts spars and other naval stores are in demand and the more so as a war with great britain is considered as near at hand <\s>
<s> du coudray who has the character of being one of the best officers of artillery in europe has been indefatigable in our service and i hope the terms i have made with him will not be thought exorbitant as he was a principal means of engaging the stores <\s>
<s> the rage as i may say for entering into the american service increases and the consequence is that i am pressed with offers and proposals many of them from persons of the first rank and eminence in the sea as well as land service <\s>
<s> count broglio who commanded the army of france during the last war did me the honor to call on me twice yesterday with an officer who served as his quarter master general the last war and has now a regiment in this service but being a german 7 and having travelled through america a few years since he is desirous of engaging in the service of the united states of north america <\s>
<s> i can by no means let slip an opportunity of engaging a person of so much experience and who is by every one recommended as one of the bravest and most skilful officers in the kingdom yet i am distressed on every such occasion for want of your particular instructions <\s>
<s> this gentleman has an independent fortune and a certain prospect of advancement here but being a zealous friend to liberty civil and religious he is actuated by the most independent and generous principles in the offer he makes of his services to the states of america <\s>
<s> enclosed you have also the plan of a french naval officer for burning ships which he gave me and at the same time showed me his draughts of ships and rates for constructing and regulating a navy of which i have the highest opinion he has seen much service is a person of study and letters as well as fortune and is ambitious of planning a navy for america which shall at once be much cheaper and more effectual than any thing of the kind which can be produced on the european system <\s>
<s> he has the command of a ship of the line in this service but is rather disgusted at not having his proposed regulations for the navy of france attended to <\s>
<s> his proposal generally is to build vessels something on the model of those designed by the marine committee to carry from 24 to 36 heavy guns on one deck which will be as formidable a battery as any ship of the line can avail itself of and by fighting them on the upper deck a much surer one <\s>
<s> had i power to treat with this gentleman i believe his character and friends are such that he could have two or three such frigates immediately constructed here on credit and manned and sent to america but the want of instruction or intelligence or remittances with the late check on long island has sunk our credit to nothing with individuals and the goods for the indian contract cannot be shipped unless remittances are made to a much greater amount than at present <\s>
<s> not ten thousand pounds have been received for forty thousand delivered in america as early as last february and i am ignorant what has become of the effects shipped <\s>
<s> under these circumstances i have no courage to urge a credit which i have no prospect of supporting but i will take mr morris's hint and write a letter solely on business but politics and my business are almost inseparably connected <\s>

<s> gentlemen this serves only to enclose and explain the within _state of the commerce of leghorn which was given me by the envoy of the grand duke of tuscany a gentleman of universal knowledge and a warm friend to america and indeed to all mankind <\s>
<s> i have the honor of his acquaintance in an intimate degree and have communicated to him a memoir setting forth the particular state of the commerce of america with the history of its rise and increase and its present importance it being a copy of what i delivered to this court <\s>
<s> he has marked the articles generally in demand after which he enumerates their articles for exportation which in my turn i marked and observed upon as you will see <\s>
<s> i have only to add that the grand duke has taken off all duties on the american commerce to give it encouragement <\s>
<s> this indeed is done rather privately to prevent complaint of other powers of a seeming partiality <\s>
<s> when i add to this that it is agreed on all hands that ships of war may be purchased at leghorn ready fitted for sea cheaper than in any other port in europe i think a good acquaintance ought to be cultivated with this state <\s>

<s> gentlemen in a former letter i mentioned a naval enterprise which might at first appear romantic but the more it is considered the less danger i shall be in of being taxed on that score <\s>
<s> admiral montague lately returned from the banks where the fishermen have had a wretched season in consequence of the american privateers <\s>
<s> he left two small sloops of war there of 14 and 16 guns <\s>
<s> in common years they leave six or seven thousand of their laborers or fishermen there as in a prison through the winter employed in taking seals repairing boats stages c these are unarmed and ever dissatisfied to the last degree with their situation <\s>
<s> two frigates arriving early in february would destroy the fishery for one if not two years and obtain an acquisition of a fine body of recruits for your navy <\s>
<s> i have conferred with some persons here on the subject who highly approve the enterprise but i submit it to your opinion after urging despatch in whatever is done or attempted on that subject <\s>

<s> lee at bilboa gives every encouragement to adventurers in these seas where the prizes are valuable and where you have constantly harbors at hand on the coast of france and spain to repair to and refit in and where constant and certain intelligence can be had of the situation of the british ships of war as well as of commerce <\s>
<s> i need not add on a subject so plain and at the same time so important but will only remind you that the dutch in the space of two or three years after their first revolt from spain attacked the spaniards so successfully and unexpectedly in every quarter of the globe that the treasures they obtained thereby enabled them to carry on the war <\s>
<s> let me repeat that if you empower me or any other person here you may obtain any number of ships of war on credit from individuals on paying interest at five per cent until the principal is discharged <\s>

<s> gentlemen your favor of the 7th of august last covering a copy of yours of the 8th of july i received though the original never came to hand <\s>
<s> this letter also enclosed the _declaration of independency with instructions to make it known to this and the other powers of europe and i received it the 7th inst <\s>
<s> though the vessel which brought it had but 38 days passage from salem <\s>
<s> this letter was very far from relieving me as it enclosed what had been circulated through europe for two months before and my pretending to inform this court would be only a matter of form in consequence of your orders which were expressed in the style of any common affair <\s>
<s> i certainly prefer simplicity of style as well as manners but something is due to the dignity of old and powerful states or if you please to their prejudices in favor of long established form and etiquette and as the united states of america by this act introduce themselves among the established powers and rank with them it must of course be expected that at the first introduction or the announcing of it some mode more formal or if i may so say more respectful would have been made use of than simply two or three lines from the committee of congress in a letter something more apparently authentic not that either your power or the reality of your letter could be doubted <\s>
<s> i mention it as deserving consideration whether in your application here and your powers and instructions of a public nature it is not always proper to use a seal <\s>
<s> this is a very ancient custom in all public and even private concerns of any consequence <\s>
<s> further to keep a proper intercourse with europe it is by no means sufficient to write a single letter and leave it to be forwarded when the captain of a vessel thinks of it or has nothing else to do <\s>
<s> duplicates of every letter should be lodged in every port in the hands of faithful and attentive persons to be forwarded by the first conveyance to any part of europe <\s>
<s> had this been practised since my leaving america instead of receiving but two short letters from you i might have had intelligence every month let me urge you from the danger our affairs have been in of totally miscarrying for want of intelligence to pay some attention to this in future <\s>
<s> as the copy was dated the eighth of july i took occasion to observe that the honorable congress had taken the earliest opportunity of informing this court of the declaration of their independency and that the variety of important affairs before congress with the critical situation of the armies in their neighborhood and the obstructions of their commerce had prevented that intelligence which had been wished for but that the present served to shew the early and principal attention of the united states to this court and as their independency was now in form declared the queries i had formerly put in consequence of my first instructions might now be resolved and i hoped favorably <\s>
<s> to this i was answered unless france by a public acknowledgment of your independency makes war on great britain in your favor what service can such acknowledgment be of to the united states <\s>
<s> you are known here our ports are open and free for your commerce and your ships are protected in them and greater indulgencies allowed than to any other nations <\s>
<s> if france should be obliged to make war on england it will be much more just and honorable in the eyes of the world to make it on some other account and if made at all it is the same thing to the united states of america and in one important view better for them to have it originate from any other cause as america will be under the less immediate obligation <\s>
<s> further france has alliances and cannot resolve a question which must perhaps involve her in a war without previously consulting them <\s>
<s> meantime the united states can receive the same succors and assistance from france without as well as with such an open acknowledgment and perhaps much more advantageously <\s>
<s> to this and such like arguments i had the less to reply as you informed me that articles for a proposed alliance with france were under consideration and that i might soon expect them <\s>
<s> i was further told that the swiss cantons though in every respect free and independent states for several centuries had not to this hour been acknowledged as such by any public act of any one power in europe except france and that neither the revolution in the united provinces or portugal had been attended with any such acknowledgment though the powers of europe in both cases lent their aid <\s>
<s> i replied that i would not urge a formal acknowledgment as long as the same ends could be obtained and without the inconveniences hinted at besides as i daily expected further instructions i would reserve myself until their arrival <\s>
<s> the apprehensions of the united states negociating has done us much damage and the interview at new york said to have been between a commissioner of congress and the two brothers however politic the step may have been in america was made use of to our prejudice in europe at this court in particular as it has been for some time asserted by lord stormont and others that a negociation would take place and as far as this is believed so far our cause has suffered and our friends been staggered in their resolutions <\s>
<s> my opinion is that the house of bourbon in every branch will be our friends it is their interest to humble great britain <\s>
<s> yesterday it was roundly affirmed at versailles that a letter was received in london from philadelphia in which it was said i had written advising the congress to negociate for that i could obtain no assistance from europe <\s>
<s> you can hardly conceive how dangerous even such reports are and how prejudicial every step that looks like confirming them <\s>
<s> the importance of america in every point of view appears more and more striking to all europe but particularly to this kingdom <\s>
<s> enclosed i send you the size of masts and spars with the price which if it will answer may be a certain article of remittance as may other naval stores but i dare not contract with the marine as i have no powers and am unacquainted with the rate at which they were usually exported to england <\s>
<s> a wide field is opening since the american commerce is to be free and i have had applications from many parts on the subject though few are disposed to venture until the close of this campaign and if it is not decisive against us our wants will be supplied another season at as cheap a rate as ever but i trust never more on the old terms of long credit <\s>
<s> i am well nigh harrassed to death with applications of officers to go out to america <\s>
<s> those i have engaged are i trust in general of the best character but that i should engage or rather take from the hands of some leading men here some one or two among the rest not so accomplished cannot be surprising and may considering my situation be pardonable but i have no suspicion of any such in my department of consequence <\s>
<s> i have been offered troops from germany on the following general terms viz officers to recruit as for the service of france and embark for st domingo from dunkirk and by altering their route land in the american states <\s>
<s> the same has been proposed with switzerland to which i could give no encouragement but submit it to your consideration in congress whether if you can establish a credit as i have before hinted it would not be well to purchase at leghorn five or six stout frigates which might at once transport some companies of swiss and a quantity of stores and the whole be defended by the swiss soldiers on their passage <\s>
<s> or if you prefer germans which i really do not the vessels might go from dunkirk <\s>
<s> i daily expect important advices from the north respecting commerce at least having sent to the king of prussia in consequence of a memorial he ordered his agent here to show me and propose some queries to me a state of the north american commerce at large <\s>
<s> i have presented memorial after memorial here until in my last i think i have exhausted the subject as far as the present time having in my last given the history of the controversy obviated the objections made against us and pointed out the consequences that must ensue to france and spain if they permit the colonies to be subjugated by their old hereditary enemy <\s>
<s> it consisted of fifty pages and was after being translated presented to his majesty and his ministers and i was assured was favorably received and considered <\s>
<s> i presented it about two weeks since and whether it has hastened the preparations or not i cannot say <\s>

<s> the laws of france are clear with regard to the validity of this prize and our captains have orders contained in their commissions to submit their prizes to the laws of the country into which they carry them and they ought undoubtedly to regulate their own conduct by those laws without any regard to the laws of america relating to this matter which may be different in every one of the united states and therefore too uncertain to be made the rule for judgement in the courts here <\s>

<s> the laws of france are clear with regard to the validity of this prize and our captains have orders contained in their commissions to submit their prizes to the laws of the country into which they carry them and they ought undoubtedly to regulate their own conduct by those laws without any regard to the laws of america relating to this matter which may be different in every one of the united states and therefore too uncertain to be made the rule for judgement in the courts here <\s>

<s> we believe that no americans in france will ever think of claiming here any advantage by virtue of the laws of their own country and it seems not just to put those laws in force against them in france when it may be done to their detriment <\s>
<s> the vexation of these kinds of processes and the slowness and length of these expensive proceedings before a decision can be obtained discourage our armed vessels and have tended to impress them with an opinion that their operations against the english cannot be carried on to advantage in the european seas <\s>

<s> the laws of france are clear with regard to the validity of this prize and our captains have orders contained in their commissions to submit their prizes to the laws of the country into which they carry them and they ought undoubtedly to regulate their own conduct by those laws without any regard to the laws of america relating to this matter which may be different in every one of the united states and therefore too uncertain to be made the rule for judgement in the courts here <\s>

<s> the laws of france are clear with regard to the validity of this prize and our captains have orders contained in their commissions to submit their prizes to the laws of the country into which they carry them and they ought undoubtedly to regulate their own conduct by those laws without any regard to the laws of america relating to this matter which may be different in every one of the united states and therefore too uncertain to be made the rule for judgement in the courts here <\s>

<s> the laws of france are clear with regard to the validity of this prize and our captains have orders contained in their commissions to submit their prizes to the laws of the country into which they carry them and they ought undoubtedly to regulate their own conduct by those laws without any regard to the laws of america relating to this matter which may be different in every one of the united states and therefore too uncertain to be made the rule for judgement in the courts here <\s>

<s> great numbers of seamen too would become prisoners a loss that england cannot repair <\s>
<s> it is conceived that it would be impossible for great britain to send a very great fleet after the french into those seas <\s>
<s> their men of war now in europe are too old too rotten too ill manned and their masts and yards are of too bad materials to endure such a navigation <\s>
<s> the impossibility of their obtaining provisions artists and materials in that country which would be easy to the french makes it still clearer that they cannot send a great additional force and the fear of spain's interfering with her powerful navy would restrain them <\s>
<s> whereas france has nothing to fear in europe from them as the number and excellence of their armies are an ample security against the feeble land forces of great britain <\s>
<s> this naval superiority would open such commerce between the united states and the french west india islands as would enable our people to supply themselves with the european and west india articles they want to send abroad the produce of the country and by giving fresh spirit and vigor to trade would employ the paper currency the want of which employ has been one cause of its depreciation <\s>
<s> the maintenance of such a fleet in america would circulate so many bills of exchange as would likewise in a great measure relieve them from that dangerous evil <\s>
<s> and these bills would all return to france for her manufactures thereby cementing the connexion and extending the trade between the two countries <\s>
<s> such a naval superiority would contribute very much to extinguish the hopes of the remaining number of persons who secretly wish from sinister motives to become again subjected to great britain and would enable the people of the several states to give such consistency and stability to their infant governments as would contribute greatly to their internal repose as well as to the vigor of their future operations against the common enemy <\s>
<s> the late speedy supply and reparation of his majesty's fleet at boston will show the advantages which this country must enjoy in carrying on a naval war on a coast friendly to her and hostile to her enemy <\s>
<s> and these advantages will in future be more sensible because the appearance of the fleet before was unexpected and the harvest in that part of the country had been unfavorable <\s>
<s> it is obvious to all europe that nothing less is at stake than the dominion of the sea at least the superiority of naval power and we cannot expect great britain will ever give it up without some decisive effort on the part of france <\s>
<s> with such an exertion as that of sending a superior fleet to america we see nothing in the course of human affairs that can possibly prevent france from obtaining such a naval superiority without delay <\s>
<s> without it the war may languish for years to the infinite distress of our country to the exhausting both of france and england and the question left to be decided by another war <\s>
<s> we are more earnest in representing these things to your excellency as all our correspondence from england for some time has uniformly represented that the intention of the cabinet is conformable to the spirit of the manifesto that all parties grow more and more out of temper with the americans that it has become fashionable with the minority as well as the majority and administration to reproach us both in and out of parliament that all parties join in speaking of us in the bitterest terms and in heartily wishing our destruction that great clamors are raised about our alliance with france as an unnatural combination to ruin them that the cry is for a speedy and powerful reinforcement of their army and for the activity of their fleet in making descents on the sea coast while murdering and desolating parties are let loose upon the frontiers of the carolinas virginia pennsylvania new jersey new york and new england and that very early in the year they will carry all these projects into execution <\s>
<s> this whole system may as we conceive be defeated and the power of great britain now in america totally subdued and if their power is subdued there it is reduced every where by the measure we have the honor to propose <\s>
<s> we submit the whole merely as our opinion to your excellency's superior wisdom and have the honor to be c <\s>

<s> sir we had the honor of receiving your excellency's letter of the 22d and are much obliged to you for the interest you take in what concerns the unhappy prisoners who may escape from england <\s>
<s> we have not been inattentive to that subject <\s>
<s> there are persons who supply them at bordeaux brest l'orient nantes and dunkirk <\s>
<s> a gentleman at calais has voluntarily done this service for which we have directed him to draw on us for his disbursements and we shall as readily discharge what may have been disbursed by your commissaries when we have their accounts <\s>
<s> as there is very little probability of prisoners coming to other ports we will not give your excellency the trouble you are so good as to offer to take <\s>
<s> the regulation your excellency proposes relative to the prisoners we may take from the enemy and bring into the ports of france is entirely agreeable to us and we shall direct our agents accordingly who will readily deliver such prisoners to the persons your excellency may appoint to receive them having already requested us to procure written orders from you without which your commissaries were unwilling to take charge of them <\s>

<s> i know that you direct your agents in different ports of the kingdom to supply american prisoners escaped or returning from england with whatever may be necessary on their arrival but you appear not to have given these orders in the ports of normandy and i am informed that some prisoners who need assistance have appeared in those ports <\s>
<s> it seems to me necessary that you should take such measures as you may judge proper on this subject <\s>
<s> i will transmit to you an account of the expenses which have been incurred up to the last of december <\s>
<s> i have given orders in all the ports for the reception of english prisoners brought in by citizens of the united states for their detention in the prisons destined for that purpose and for their usual supply of rations a particular account of this expenditure will be kept <\s>

<s> as we have heard nothing further of the congress in germany which you inform us was talked of we presume that no such measure will take place <\s>
<s> however whether there be a congress or not we cannot comply with the terms of the gentleman you mention nor advise him to take any steps in the business <\s>
<s> we have also the honor of your letter of the 9th of december informing us of your draft upon us for twentyfour thousand livres at one month's date payable to mr grand <\s>

<s> gentlemen we had yesterday the honor of your letter of the 21st of this month <\s>
<s> you desire to know what port or ports is or are made free pursuant to the treaty <\s>
<s> we believe that none has as yet been determined on at present all the ports of france are open to american vessels of all denominations and we are at present rather doubtful whether it would be politic in us to apply to have any distinction made <\s>
<s> if the appointment of free ports would relieve us from the payment of duties import or export we should apply immediately <\s>
<s> but as we apprehend this advantage would not be the consequence the limits of the free ports would be prescribed and the same duties must be paid upon removing goods within or without those limits as are now paid upon the imports and exports <\s>
<s> goods however might be brought into such free ports from abroad and then landed and stand for a time and then exported without paying duties but whether this would be any great advantage to our trade you are better judges than we <\s>
<s> we shall be glad of your advice upon this head and if you think of any advantages of considerable moment that would arise we shall be always ready to apply for such an appointment <\s>
<s> we are sorry it is not in our power to give you any acceptable information respecting the 8th article of the treaty relating to the barbary corsairs <\s>
<s> all we can say is that we have applied to the ministry upon this head some months ago and received satisfactory expressions of the disposition of this government to do every thing which is stipulated in that article of the treaty <\s>
<s> but some things remain to be determined by congress to whom we have written upon the subject and we must necessarily wait their instructions <\s>
<s> there are two inquiries to be made viz <\s>
<s> which of all the nations who now trade with france is the most favored and what duties are paid by that nation <\s>
<s> these duties and these only we suppose we are to pay and as soon as circumstances will permit two of us having been for a fortnight very ill and one of us continuing so we shall apply to the ministry for an eclaircissement upon this head which we will endeavor to communicate to you as soon as we shall obtain it <\s>
<s> we have received an answer to our last application for a convoy from their excellencies count de vergennes and m <\s>
<s> de sartine but the answers convinced us that m <\s>
<s> de sartine was under some misinformation or misunderstanding relative to the business which obliged us to write again <\s>

<s> sir it is now six months since captain m'neil of the mifflin privateer from america has been embarrassed with a process on account of a french ship which he retook from the english after she had been three days in their possession <\s>
<s> the laws of france are clear with regard to the validity of this prize and our captains have orders contained in their commissions to submit their prizes to the laws of the country into which they carry them and they ought undoubtedly to regulate their own conduct by those laws without any regard to the laws of america relating to this matter which may be different in every one of the united states and therefore too uncertain to be made the rule for judgement in the courts here <\s>
<s> but the persons reclaiming this prize insist among other reasons that their cause should be judged by the laws of captain m'neil's country because more favorable for them <\s>
<s> we believe that no americans in france will ever think of claiming here any advantage by virtue of the laws of their own country and it seems not just to put those laws in force against them in france when it may be done to their detriment <\s>
<s> the vexation of these kinds of processes and the slowness and length of these expensive proceedings before a decision can be obtained discourage our armed vessels and have tended to impress them with an opinion that their operations against the english cannot be carried on to advantage in the european seas <\s>
<s> we therefore request your excellency to join your solicitations to those we have had the honor to make to m <\s>
<s> de sartine that these processes may be more speedily determined and that the americans in france may be treated in those respects on the same footing with the subjects of his majesty of which we shall be glad to give information to the congress that so some popular prejudices occasioned by these affairs may be effectually removed and the american armed ships be encouraged to return and cruise again upon the coasts of england <\s>

<s> sir captain jones has represented to us his desire and intention of returning to the countess of selkirk some plate which his people took from her house <\s>
<s> we apprehend that congress would not disapprove of this measure as far as it should depend upon them and we therefore consent on the part of the united states that this plate should be returned <\s>
<s> this consent is to be understood to extend no further than to the share to which the united states may be supposed to have a claim <\s>

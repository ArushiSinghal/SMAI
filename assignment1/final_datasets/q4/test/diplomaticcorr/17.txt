<s> sir we embrace this first opportunity to answer the letter which your excellency did us the honor to address to us the 16th of this month <\s>

<s> i am sir with due regard your most humble servant john paul jones <\s>
<s> abraham whipple to john paul jones <\s>
<s> brest august 19 1778 <\s>
<s> sir i am honored with your letter of this day requesting that i will summon a court martial for the trial of lieutenant thomas simpson with whose conduct you have been and are unsatisfied and who you say is under suspension for disobedience to your written orders <\s>
<s> having maturely considered the contents of your letter and with as much accuracy as possible attended to every particular i return for answer the subjoined reasons which will at once explain the impossibility of calling a court martial and fully acquaint you with my sentiments on that subject <\s>
<s> you are sensible that the continental regulations have expressly ordered that a court martial shall consist of at least three captains which is impossible as captain hinman declines to sit he expecting a court of inquiry upon his own conduct on his arrival in america and having assigned a reason of so forcible a nature i think he is acting a part at once prudent and becoming <\s>
<s> you will permit the remark that by lieutenant simpson's parole taken by yourself june 10th 1778 lieutenant simpson engaged on his parole of honor to consider himself as under suspension till he shall be called upon to meet you face to face before a court martial unless you should in the meantime release him from his parole which i conceive that you have done by your letter of the 16th of july to the honorable commissioners where you mention that you are willing to let the dispute drop forever by giving up that parole which would entitle lieutenant simpson to the command of the ranger that this as you bore no malice would be making him all the present satisfaction in your power provided that you had injured him and that you will trust to himself to make an acknowledgment if on the contrary he has injured you <\s>
<s> in my opinion this is giving up his parole in the most ample manner as it does not appear to me that you made by letter or otherwise any compact or agreement with lieutenant simpson that he should make any concessions on his part or any thing of that nature neither that he was to be answerable to a court martial when the supposed crime was blotted out for which he was at first responsible <\s>
<s> i believe that the honorable commissioners accepted it in the same light as by their letter of the same date it would seem you gave them the greatest satisfaction in affording them an opportunity to reinstate lieutenant simpson on board the ranger <\s>
<s> the commissioners further order him to take the command of the ranger as her first lieutenant and to join me and to obey my orders all which sufficiently evinces that lieutenant simpson is no longer considered as under suspension and consequently cannot be responsible to a court martial for disobedience to written orders from you from which he is amply released by your voluntary surrender of his parole <\s>
<s> however if this explanation attempted to be made in the most candid manner should not prove agreeable i beg leave to refer you to the absolute impossibility of calling a court martial agreeable to the resolves of congress and flatter myself that you will believe me to be with due respect sir your most obedient and most humble servant abraham whipple <\s>

<s> passy august 22d 1778 <\s>
<s> sir we have received your letter of the 15th and have written to captain whipple to appoint a court martial for the trial of lieutenant simpson provided there is a sufficient number of officers to constitute one <\s>
<s> this however is not to make any change in his command of the ranger until the trial is over nor then unless the judgment of that court is against him <\s>

<s> passy august 28th 1778 <\s>
<s> sir there are several subjects which we find it necessary to lay before your excellency and to which we have the honor to request your attention <\s>
<s> at a time when the circumstances of the war may demand the attention of government and without doubt call for so great expense we are sorry to be obliged to request your excellency's advice respecting the subject of money but the nature of the war in america the vast extent of country to defend and this defence having been made chiefly by militia engaged for short periods which often obliged us to pay more men than could be brought into actual service and above all this war having been conducted in the midst of thirteen revolutions of civil government against a nation very powerful both by sea and land has occasioned a very great expense to a country so young and to a government so unsettled <\s>
<s> this has made emissions of paper money indispensable in much larger sums than in the ordinary course of business is necessary or than in any other circumstances would have been politic <\s>
<s> in order to avoid the necessity of further emissions as much as possible the congress have borrowed large sums of this paper money of the possessors upon interest and have promised the lenders payment of that interest in europe and we therefore expect that vessels from america will bring bills of exchange upon us for that interest a large sum of which is now due <\s>
<s> it is very true that our country is already under obligations to his majesty's goodness for considerable sums of money the necessities of the united states have been such that the sums heretofore generously furnished are nearly if not quite expended and when your excellency considers that the american trade has been almost entirely interrupted by the british power at sea they having taken as many of our vessels as to render this trade more advantageous to our enemy than to ourselves that our frigates and other vessels which have arrived in this kingdom have cost us a great sum that the provision of clothing and all the necessaries of war for our army except such as we could make in that country have been shipped from hence at our expense that the expense we have been obliged to incur for our unfortunate countrymen who have been prisoners in england as well as the maintenance of those taken from the enemy has been very considerable your excellency will not be surprised when you are informed that our resources are exhausted <\s>
<s> we therefore hope for the continuance of his majesty's generosity and that the quarterly payment of seven hundred and fifty thousand livres may be continued <\s>
<s> and we assure your excellency that the moment we are furnished with any other means of answering this demand we will no longer trespass on his majesty's goodness <\s>
<s> we have further to inform your excellency that we are empowered and instructed by congress to borrow in europe a sum of money to the amount of two millions sterling which is to be appropriated to the express purpose of redeeming so many of the bills of credit in america as will be sufficient it is apprehended to restore the remainder to their original value <\s>
<s> we therefore request his majesty's permission to borrow such part of that sum in his majesty's kingdom as we may find opportunity <\s>
<s> although we are empowered to offer a larger interest than is usually given by his majesty yet that we may not be any interruption to his majesty's service we are willing and desirous of limiting the interest which we may offer to the same that is given by his majesty <\s>
<s> and in this way although most persons will choose to lend their money to his majesty yet there may be others desirous of forming connexions of trade with the people in america who will be willing to serve them in this way <\s>
<s> and perhaps nothing will have a greater tendency to cement the connexion between the two nations so happily begun or to insure to the french nation the benefits of the american trade than something of this kind <\s>

<s> in my opinion this is giving up his parole in the most ample manner as it does not appear to me that you made by letter or otherwise any compact or agreement with lieutenant simpson that he should make any concessions on his part or any thing of that nature neither that he was to be answerable to a court martial when the supposed crime was blotted out for which he was at first responsible <\s>

<s> at a time when the circumstances of the war may demand the attention of government and without doubt call for so great expense we are sorry to be obliged to request your excellency's advice respecting the subject of money but the nature of the war in america the vast extent of country to defend and this defence having been made chiefly by militia engaged for short periods which often obliged us to pay more men than could be brought into actual service and above all this war having been conducted in the midst of thirteen revolutions of civil government against a nation very powerful both by sea and land has occasioned a very great expense to a country so young and to a government so unsettled <\s>
<s> this has made emissions of paper money indispensable in much larger sums than in the ordinary course of business is necessary or than in any other circumstances would have been politic <\s>
<s> in order to avoid the necessity of further emissions as much as possible the congress have borrowed large sums of this paper money of the possessors upon interest and have promised the lenders payment of that interest in europe and we therefore expect that vessels from america will bring bills of exchange upon us for that interest a large sum of which is now due <\s>
<s> it is very true that our country is already under obligations to his majesty's goodness for considerable sums of money the necessities of the united states have been such that the sums heretofore generously furnished are nearly if not quite expended and when your excellency considers that the american trade has been almost entirely interrupted by the british power at sea they having taken as many of our vessels as to render this trade more advantageous to our enemy than to ourselves that our frigates and other vessels which have arrived in this kingdom have cost us a great sum that the provision of clothing and all the necessaries of war for our army except such as we could make in that country have been shipped from hence at our expense that the expense we have been obliged to incur for our unfortunate countrymen who have been prisoners in england as well as the maintenance of those taken from the enemy has been very considerable your excellency will not be surprised when you are informed that our resources are exhausted <\s>
<s> we therefore hope for the continuance of his majesty's generosity and that the quarterly payment of seven hundred and fifty thousand livres may be continued <\s>
<s> and we assure your excellency that the moment we are furnished with any other means of answering this demand we will no longer trespass on his majesty's goodness <\s>
<s> we have further to inform your excellency that we are empowered and instructed by congress to borrow in europe a sum of money to the amount of two millions sterling which is to be appropriated to the express purpose of redeeming so many of the bills of credit in america as will be sufficient it is apprehended to restore the remainder to their original value <\s>
<s> we therefore request his majesty's permission to borrow such part of that sum in his majesty's kingdom as we may find opportunity <\s>
<s> although we are empowered to offer a larger interest than is usually given by his majesty yet that we may not be any interruption to his majesty's service we are willing and desirous of limiting the interest which we may offer to the same that is given by his majesty <\s>
<s> and in this way although most persons will choose to lend their money to his majesty yet there may be others desirous of forming connexions of trade with the people in america who will be willing to serve them in this way <\s>
<s> and perhaps nothing will have a greater tendency to cement the connexion between the two nations so happily begun or to insure to the french nation the benefits of the american trade than something of this kind <\s>

<s> i make no doubt on the other hand but that the united states will grant the same facilities to french privateers <\s>

<s> sir your excellency's letter of the 29th of july enclosing a plan for a system of regulations for prizes and prisoners we had the honor of receiving in due time and are very sorry it has remained so long unanswered <\s>
<s> in general we are of opinion that the regulations are very good but we beg leave to lay before your excellency the following observations <\s>
<s> upon the 2d article we observe that the extensive jurisdiction of the judges of admiralty in america which considering the local and other circumstances of that country cannot easily be contracted will probably render this regulation impracticable in america <\s>
<s> in france it will as far as we are able to judge of it be very practicable and consequently beneficial <\s>
<s> but we submit to your excellency's consideration whether it would not be better in america after the words _les dites juges to add or the register of the court of admiralty or some other person authorized by the judge <\s>
<s> the jurisdiction of the court of admiralty in america extending for some hundred miles this regulation would be subject to great delays and other inconveniences if it was confined to the judge <\s>
<s> the 4th article seems to be subject to the same inconveniencies and therefore to require the same amendment <\s>
<s> upon the 14th article we beg leave to submit to your excellency's consideration whether the heavy duties upon british merchandise and manufactures if these are to be paid upon prize goods will not operate as a great discouragement to the sale of prizes made by american cruisers and whether it would be consistent with his majesty's interest to permit merchandise and manufactures taken in prizes made by americans to be stored in his majesty's warehouses if you please until they can be exported to america and without being subject to duties <\s>
<s> we know not the expense that will attend these regulations and proceedings in the courts of this kingdom but as the fees of office in america are very moderate and our people have been accustomed to such only we submit to your excellency whether it will not be necessary to state and establish the fees here and make the establishments so far public that americans may be able to inform themselves <\s>
<s> as we are not well instructed in the laws of this kingdom or in the course of the courts of admiralty here it is very possible that some inconveniencies may arise in the practice upon these regulations which we do not at present foresee if they should we shall beg leave to represent them to your excellency and to request his majesty to make the necessary alterations <\s>
<s> we submit these observations to your excellency's superior wisdom and have the honor to be with sentiments of the most perfect respect your excellency's most obedient and most humble servants arthur lee john adams <\s>

<s> but mr hill who was last winter at passy and sailed with me from nantes informs me truly that it is generally reported in the ranger and of course through the french fleet and on shore that i am turned out of the service and that you gentlemen gave mr simpson my place with a captain's commission that my letter of the 16th of july to you was involuntary on my part and in obedience only to your orders to avert dreadful consequences to myself <\s>
<s> these gentlemen are not idle ill-grounded conjectures but melancholy facts therefore i beseech you i conjure you i demand of you to afford me redress--redress by a court martial to form which we have now a sufficient number of officers in france with the assistance of captain hinman exclusive of myself <\s>

<s> abraham whipple to john paul jones <\s>
<s> brest august 19 1778 <\s>
<s> sir i am honored with your letter of this day requesting that i will summon a court martial for the trial of lieutenant thomas simpson with whose conduct you have been and are unsatisfied and who you say is under suspension for disobedience to your written orders <\s>
<s> having maturely considered the contents of your letter and with as much accuracy as possible attended to every particular i return for answer the subjoined reasons which will at once explain the impossibility of calling a court martial and fully acquaint you with my sentiments on that subject <\s>
<s> you are sensible that the continental regulations have expressly ordered that a court martial shall consist of at least three captains which is impossible as captain hinman declines to sit he expecting a court of inquiry upon his own conduct on his arrival in america and having assigned a reason of so forcible a nature i think he is acting a part at once prudent and becoming <\s>
<s> you will permit the remark that by lieutenant simpson's parole taken by yourself june 10th 1778 lieutenant simpson engaged on his parole of honor to consider himself as under suspension till he shall be called upon to meet you face to face before a court martial unless you should in the meantime release him from his parole which i conceive that you have done by your letter of the 16th of july to the honorable commissioners where you mention that you are willing to let the dispute drop forever by giving up that parole which would entitle lieutenant simpson to the command of the ranger that this as you bore no malice would be making him all the present satisfaction in your power provided that you had injured him and that you will trust to himself to make an acknowledgment if on the contrary he has injured you <\s>
<s> in my opinion this is giving up his parole in the most ample manner as it does not appear to me that you made by letter or otherwise any compact or agreement with lieutenant simpson that he should make any concessions on his part or any thing of that nature neither that he was to be answerable to a court martial when the supposed crime was blotted out for which he was at first responsible <\s>
<s> i believe that the honorable commissioners accepted it in the same light as by their letter of the same date it would seem you gave them the greatest satisfaction in affording them an opportunity to reinstate lieutenant simpson on board the ranger <\s>
<s> the commissioners further order him to take the command of the ranger as her first lieutenant and to join me and to obey my orders all which sufficiently evinces that lieutenant simpson is no longer considered as under suspension and consequently cannot be responsible to a court martial for disobedience to written orders from you from which he is amply released by your voluntary surrender of his parole <\s>
<s> however if this explanation attempted to be made in the most candid manner should not prove agreeable i beg leave to refer you to the absolute impossibility of calling a court martial agreeable to the resolves of congress and flatter myself that you will believe me to be with due respect sir your most obedient and most humble servant abraham whipple <\s>

<s> sir there are several subjects which we find it necessary to lay before your excellency and to which we have the honor to request your attention <\s>
<s> at a time when the circumstances of the war may demand the attention of government and without doubt call for so great expense we are sorry to be obliged to request your excellency's advice respecting the subject of money but the nature of the war in america the vast extent of country to defend and this defence having been made chiefly by militia engaged for short periods which often obliged us to pay more men than could be brought into actual service and above all this war having been conducted in the midst of thirteen revolutions of civil government against a nation very powerful both by sea and land has occasioned a very great expense to a country so young and to a government so unsettled <\s>
<s> this has made emissions of paper money indispensable in much larger sums than in the ordinary course of business is necessary or than in any other circumstances would have been politic <\s>
<s> in order to avoid the necessity of further emissions as much as possible the congress have borrowed large sums of this paper money of the possessors upon interest and have promised the lenders payment of that interest in europe and we therefore expect that vessels from america will bring bills of exchange upon us for that interest a large sum of which is now due <\s>
<s> it is very true that our country is already under obligations to his majesty's goodness for considerable sums of money the necessities of the united states have been such that the sums heretofore generously furnished are nearly if not quite expended and when your excellency considers that the american trade has been almost entirely interrupted by the british power at sea they having taken as many of our vessels as to render this trade more advantageous to our enemy than to ourselves that our frigates and other vessels which have arrived in this kingdom have cost us a great sum that the provision of clothing and all the necessaries of war for our army except such as we could make in that country have been shipped from hence at our expense that the expense we have been obliged to incur for our unfortunate countrymen who have been prisoners in england as well as the maintenance of those taken from the enemy has been very considerable your excellency will not be surprised when you are informed that our resources are exhausted <\s>
<s> we therefore hope for the continuance of his majesty's generosity and that the quarterly payment of seven hundred and fifty thousand livres may be continued <\s>
<s> and we assure your excellency that the moment we are furnished with any other means of answering this demand we will no longer trespass on his majesty's goodness <\s>
<s> we have further to inform your excellency that we are empowered and instructed by congress to borrow in europe a sum of money to the amount of two millions sterling which is to be appropriated to the express purpose of redeeming so many of the bills of credit in america as will be sufficient it is apprehended to restore the remainder to their original value <\s>
<s> we therefore request his majesty's permission to borrow such part of that sum in his majesty's kingdom as we may find opportunity <\s>
<s> although we are empowered to offer a larger interest than is usually given by his majesty yet that we may not be any interruption to his majesty's service we are willing and desirous of limiting the interest which we may offer to the same that is given by his majesty <\s>

<s> in my opinion this is giving up his parole in the most ample manner as it does not appear to me that you made by letter or otherwise any compact or agreement with lieutenant simpson that he should make any concessions on his part or any thing of that nature neither that he was to be answerable to a court martial when the supposed crime was blotted out for which he was at first responsible <\s>

<s> sir there are several subjects which we find it necessary to lay before your excellency and to which we have the honor to request your attention <\s>
<s> at a time when the circumstances of the war may demand the attention of government and without doubt call for so great expense we are sorry to be obliged to request your excellency's advice respecting the subject of money but the nature of the war in america the vast extent of country to defend and this defence having been made chiefly by militia engaged for short periods which often obliged us to pay more men than could be brought into actual service and above all this war having been conducted in the midst of thirteen revolutions of civil government against a nation very powerful both by sea and land has occasioned a very great expense to a country so young and to a government so unsettled <\s>
<s> this has made emissions of paper money indispensable in much larger sums than in the ordinary course of business is necessary or than in any other circumstances would have been politic <\s>
<s> in order to avoid the necessity of further emissions as much as possible the congress have borrowed large sums of this paper money of the possessors upon interest and have promised the lenders payment of that interest in europe and we therefore expect that vessels from america will bring bills of exchange upon us for that interest a large sum of which is now due <\s>
<s> it is very true that our country is already under obligations to his majesty's goodness for considerable sums of money the necessities of the united states have been such that the sums heretofore generously furnished are nearly if not quite expended and when your excellency considers that the american trade has been almost entirely interrupted by the british power at sea they having taken as many of our vessels as to render this trade more advantageous to our enemy than to ourselves that our frigates and other vessels which have arrived in this kingdom have cost us a great sum that the provision of clothing and all the necessaries of war for our army except such as we could make in that country have been shipped from hence at our expense that the expense we have been obliged to incur for our unfortunate countrymen who have been prisoners in england as well as the maintenance of those taken from the enemy has been very considerable your excellency will not be surprised when you are informed that our resources are exhausted <\s>
<s> we therefore hope for the continuance of his majesty's generosity and that the quarterly payment of seven hundred and fifty thousand livres may be continued <\s>
<s> and we assure your excellency that the moment we are furnished with any other means of answering this demand we will no longer trespass on his majesty's goodness <\s>
<s> we have further to inform your excellency that we are empowered and instructed by congress to borrow in europe a sum of money to the amount of two millions sterling which is to be appropriated to the express purpose of redeeming so many of the bills of credit in america as will be sufficient it is apprehended to restore the remainder to their original value <\s>
<s> we therefore request his majesty's permission to borrow such part of that sum in his majesty's kingdom as we may find opportunity <\s>
<s> although we are empowered to offer a larger interest than is usually given by his majesty yet that we may not be any interruption to his majesty's service we are willing and desirous of limiting the interest which we may offer to the same that is given by his majesty <\s>
<s> and in this way although most persons will choose to lend their money to his majesty yet there may be others desirous of forming connexions of trade with the people in america who will be willing to serve them in this way <\s>
<s> and perhaps nothing will have a greater tendency to cement the connexion between the two nations so happily begun or to insure to the french nation the benefits of the american trade than something of this kind <\s>

<s> the difficulties which the privateers of the united states have experienced till now in the ports of france either as to the sale of their prizes or to secure their prisoners must cease from the change of circumstances <\s>
<s> i make no doubt on the other hand but that the united states will grant the same facilities to french privateers <\s>
<s> to accomplish this double object i have drafted a plan of regulations which i earnestly request you to examine and to note what you think of it or even to point out such other means as may answer the same purpose so that i may receive his majesty's orders <\s>

<s> sir your excellency's letter of the 29th of july enclosing a plan for a system of regulations for prizes and prisoners we had the honor of receiving in due time and are very sorry it has remained so long unanswered <\s>
<s> in general we are of opinion that the regulations are very good but we beg leave to lay before your excellency the following observations <\s>
<s> upon the 2d article we observe that the extensive jurisdiction of the judges of admiralty in america which considering the local and other circumstances of that country cannot easily be contracted will probably render this regulation impracticable in america <\s>
<s> in france it will as far as we are able to judge of it be very practicable and consequently beneficial <\s>
<s> but we submit to your excellency's consideration whether it would not be better in america after the words _les dites juges to add or the register of the court of admiralty or some other person authorized by the judge <\s>
<s> the jurisdiction of the court of admiralty in america extending for some hundred miles this regulation would be subject to great delays and other inconveniences if it was confined to the judge <\s>
<s> the 4th article seems to be subject to the same inconveniencies and therefore to require the same amendment <\s>
<s> upon the 14th article we beg leave to submit to your excellency's consideration whether the heavy duties upon british merchandise and manufactures if these are to be paid upon prize goods will not operate as a great discouragement to the sale of prizes made by american cruisers and whether it would be consistent with his majesty's interest to permit merchandise and manufactures taken in prizes made by americans to be stored in his majesty's warehouses if you please until they can be exported to america and without being subject to duties <\s>
<s> we know not the expense that will attend these regulations and proceedings in the courts of this kingdom but as the fees of office in america are very moderate and our people have been accustomed to such only we submit to your excellency whether it will not be necessary to state and establish the fees here and make the establishments so far public that americans may be able to inform themselves <\s>
<s> as we are not well instructed in the laws of this kingdom or in the course of the courts of admiralty here it is very possible that some inconveniencies may arise in the practice upon these regulations which we do not at present foresee if they should we shall beg leave to represent them to your excellency and to request his majesty to make the necessary alterations <\s>
<s> we submit these observations to your excellency's superior wisdom and have the honor to be with sentiments of the most perfect respect your excellency's most obedient and most humble servants arthur lee john adams <\s>

<s> but mr hill who was last winter at passy and sailed with me from nantes informs me truly that it is generally reported in the ranger and of course through the french fleet and on shore that i am turned out of the service and that you gentlemen gave mr simpson my place with a captain's commission that my letter of the 16th of july to you was involuntary on my part and in obedience only to your orders to avert dreadful consequences to myself <\s>
<s> these gentlemen are not idle ill-grounded conjectures but melancholy facts therefore i beseech you i conjure you i demand of you to afford me redress--redress by a court martial to form which we have now a sufficient number of officers in france with the assistance of captain hinman exclusive of myself <\s>
<s> the providence and the boston are expected here very soon from nantes and i am certain that they neither can nor will depart again before my friend captain hinman can come down here and it is his unquestioned right to succeed me in the command of the ranger <\s>

<s> sir there are several subjects which we find it necessary to lay before your excellency and to which we have the honor to request your attention <\s>
<s> at a time when the circumstances of the war may demand the attention of government and without doubt call for so great expense we are sorry to be obliged to request your excellency's advice respecting the subject of money but the nature of the war in america the vast extent of country to defend and this defence having been made chiefly by militia engaged for short periods which often obliged us to pay more men than could be brought into actual service and above all this war having been conducted in the midst of thirteen revolutions of civil government against a nation very powerful both by sea and land has occasioned a very great expense to a country so young and to a government so unsettled <\s>
<s> this has made emissions of paper money indispensable in much larger sums than in the ordinary course of business is necessary or than in any other circumstances would have been politic <\s>
<s> in order to avoid the necessity of further emissions as much as possible the congress have borrowed large sums of this paper money of the possessors upon interest and have promised the lenders payment of that interest in europe and we therefore expect that vessels from america will bring bills of exchange upon us for that interest a large sum of which is now due <\s>
<s> it is very true that our country is already under obligations to his majesty's goodness for considerable sums of money the necessities of the united states have been such that the sums heretofore generously furnished are nearly if not quite expended and when your excellency considers that the american trade has been almost entirely interrupted by the british power at sea they having taken as many of our vessels as to render this trade more advantageous to our enemy than to ourselves that our frigates and other vessels which have arrived in this kingdom have cost us a great sum that the provision of clothing and all the necessaries of war for our army except such as we could make in that country have been shipped from hence at our expense that the expense we have been obliged to incur for our unfortunate countrymen who have been prisoners in england as well as the maintenance of those taken from the enemy has been very considerable your excellency will not be surprised when you are informed that our resources are exhausted <\s>
<s> we therefore hope for the continuance of his majesty's generosity and that the quarterly payment of seven hundred and fifty thousand livres may be continued <\s>
<s> and we assure your excellency that the moment we are furnished with any other means of answering this demand we will no longer trespass on his majesty's goodness <\s>
<s> we have further to inform your excellency that we are empowered and instructed by congress to borrow in europe a sum of money to the amount of two millions sterling which is to be appropriated to the express purpose of redeeming so many of the bills of credit in america as will be sufficient it is apprehended to restore the remainder to their original value <\s>
<s> we therefore request his majesty's permission to borrow such part of that sum in his majesty's kingdom as we may find opportunity <\s>
<s> although we are empowered to offer a larger interest than is usually given by his majesty yet that we may not be any interruption to his majesty's service we are willing and desirous of limiting the interest which we may offer to the same that is given by his majesty <\s>
<s> and in this way although most persons will choose to lend their money to his majesty yet there may be others desirous of forming connexions of trade with the people in america who will be willing to serve them in this way <\s>

<s> upon the 14th article we beg leave to submit to your excellency's consideration whether the heavy duties upon british merchandise and manufactures if these are to be paid upon prize goods will not operate as a great discouragement to the sale of prizes made by american cruisers and whether it would be consistent with his majesty's interest to permit merchandise and manufactures taken in prizes made by americans to be stored in his majesty's warehouses if you please until they can be exported to america and without being subject to duties <\s>

<s> brest august 19 1778 <\s>
<s> sir i am honored with your letter of this day requesting that i will summon a court martial for the trial of lieutenant thomas simpson with whose conduct you have been and are unsatisfied and who you say is under suspension for disobedience to your written orders <\s>
<s> having maturely considered the contents of your letter and with as much accuracy as possible attended to every particular i return for answer the subjoined reasons which will at once explain the impossibility of calling a court martial and fully acquaint you with my sentiments on that subject <\s>
<s> you are sensible that the continental regulations have expressly ordered that a court martial shall consist of at least three captains which is impossible as captain hinman declines to sit he expecting a court of inquiry upon his own conduct on his arrival in america and having assigned a reason of so forcible a nature i think he is acting a part at once prudent and becoming <\s>
<s> you will permit the remark that by lieutenant simpson's parole taken by yourself june 10th 1778 lieutenant simpson engaged on his parole of honor to consider himself as under suspension till he shall be called upon to meet you face to face before a court martial unless you should in the meantime release him from his parole which i conceive that you have done by your letter of the 16th of july to the honorable commissioners where you mention that you are willing to let the dispute drop forever by giving up that parole which would entitle lieutenant simpson to the command of the ranger that this as you bore no malice would be making him all the present satisfaction in your power provided that you had injured him and that you will trust to himself to make an acknowledgment if on the contrary he has injured you <\s>
<s> in my opinion this is giving up his parole in the most ample manner as it does not appear to me that you made by letter or otherwise any compact or agreement with lieutenant simpson that he should make any concessions on his part or any thing of that nature neither that he was to be answerable to a court martial when the supposed crime was blotted out for which he was at first responsible <\s>
<s> i believe that the honorable commissioners accepted it in the same light as by their letter of the same date it would seem you gave them the greatest satisfaction in affording them an opportunity to reinstate lieutenant simpson on board the ranger <\s>
<s> the commissioners further order him to take the command of the ranger as her first lieutenant and to join me and to obey my orders all which sufficiently evinces that lieutenant simpson is no longer considered as under suspension and consequently cannot be responsible to a court martial for disobedience to written orders from you from which he is amply released by your voluntary surrender of his parole <\s>
<s> however if this explanation attempted to be made in the most candid manner should not prove agreeable i beg leave to refer you to the absolute impossibility of calling a court martial agreeable to the resolves of congress and flatter myself that you will believe me to be with due respect sir your most obedient and most humble servant abraham whipple <\s>

<s> sir i am honored with your letter of this day requesting that i will summon a court martial for the trial of lieutenant thomas simpson with whose conduct you have been and are unsatisfied and who you say is under suspension for disobedience to your written orders <\s>
<s> having maturely considered the contents of your letter and with as much accuracy as possible attended to every particular i return for answer the subjoined reasons which will at once explain the impossibility of calling a court martial and fully acquaint you with my sentiments on that subject <\s>
<s> you are sensible that the continental regulations have expressly ordered that a court martial shall consist of at least three captains which is impossible as captain hinman declines to sit he expecting a court of inquiry upon his own conduct on his arrival in america and having assigned a reason of so forcible a nature i think he is acting a part at once prudent and becoming <\s>
<s> you will permit the remark that by lieutenant simpson's parole taken by yourself june 10th 1778 lieutenant simpson engaged on his parole of honor to consider himself as under suspension till he shall be called upon to meet you face to face before a court martial unless you should in the meantime release him from his parole which i conceive that you have done by your letter of the 16th of july to the honorable commissioners where you mention that you are willing to let the dispute drop forever by giving up that parole which would entitle lieutenant simpson to the command of the ranger that this as you bore no malice would be making him all the present satisfaction in your power provided that you had injured him and that you will trust to himself to make an acknowledgment if on the contrary he has injured you <\s>
<s> in my opinion this is giving up his parole in the most ample manner as it does not appear to me that you made by letter or otherwise any compact or agreement with lieutenant simpson that he should make any concessions on his part or any thing of that nature neither that he was to be answerable to a court martial when the supposed crime was blotted out for which he was at first responsible <\s>
<s> i believe that the honorable commissioners accepted it in the same light as by their letter of the same date it would seem you gave them the greatest satisfaction in affording them an opportunity to reinstate lieutenant simpson on board the ranger <\s>
<s> the commissioners further order him to take the command of the ranger as her first lieutenant and to join me and to obey my orders all which sufficiently evinces that lieutenant simpson is no longer considered as under suspension and consequently cannot be responsible to a court martial for disobedience to written orders from you from which he is amply released by your voluntary surrender of his parole <\s>
<s> however if this explanation attempted to be made in the most candid manner should not prove agreeable i beg leave to refer you to the absolute impossibility of calling a court martial agreeable to the resolves of congress and flatter myself that you will believe me to be with due respect sir your most obedient and most humble servant abraham whipple <\s>

<s> sir there are several subjects which we find it necessary to lay before your excellency and to which we have the honor to request your attention <\s>
<s> at a time when the circumstances of the war may demand the attention of government and without doubt call for so great expense we are sorry to be obliged to request your excellency's advice respecting the subject of money but the nature of the war in america the vast extent of country to defend and this defence having been made chiefly by militia engaged for short periods which often obliged us to pay more men than could be brought into actual service and above all this war having been conducted in the midst of thirteen revolutions of civil government against a nation very powerful both by sea and land has occasioned a very great expense to a country so young and to a government so unsettled <\s>
<s> this has made emissions of paper money indispensable in much larger sums than in the ordinary course of business is necessary or than in any other circumstances would have been politic <\s>
<s> in order to avoid the necessity of further emissions as much as possible the congress have borrowed large sums of this paper money of the possessors upon interest and have promised the lenders payment of that interest in europe and we therefore expect that vessels from america will bring bills of exchange upon us for that interest a large sum of which is now due <\s>
<s> it is very true that our country is already under obligations to his majesty's goodness for considerable sums of money the necessities of the united states have been such that the sums heretofore generously furnished are nearly if not quite expended and when your excellency considers that the american trade has been almost entirely interrupted by the british power at sea they having taken as many of our vessels as to render this trade more advantageous to our enemy than to ourselves that our frigates and other vessels which have arrived in this kingdom have cost us a great sum that the provision of clothing and all the necessaries of war for our army except such as we could make in that country have been shipped from hence at our expense that the expense we have been obliged to incur for our unfortunate countrymen who have been prisoners in england as well as the maintenance of those taken from the enemy has been very considerable your excellency will not be surprised when you are informed that our resources are exhausted <\s>
<s> we therefore hope for the continuance of his majesty's generosity and that the quarterly payment of seven hundred and fifty thousand livres may be continued <\s>
<s> and we assure your excellency that the moment we are furnished with any other means of answering this demand we will no longer trespass on his majesty's goodness <\s>
<s> we have further to inform your excellency that we are empowered and instructed by congress to borrow in europe a sum of money to the amount of two millions sterling which is to be appropriated to the express purpose of redeeming so many of the bills of credit in america as will be sufficient it is apprehended to restore the remainder to their original value <\s>
<s> we therefore request his majesty's permission to borrow such part of that sum in his majesty's kingdom as we may find opportunity <\s>
<s> although we are empowered to offer a larger interest than is usually given by his majesty yet that we may not be any interruption to his majesty's service we are willing and desirous of limiting the interest which we may offer to the same that is given by his majesty <\s>
<s> and in this way although most persons will choose to lend their money to his majesty yet there may be others desirous of forming connexions of trade with the people in america who will be willing to serve them in this way <\s>
<s> and perhaps nothing will have a greater tendency to cement the connexion between the two nations so happily begun or to insure to the french nation the benefits of the american trade than something of this kind <\s>

<s> gentlemen i have received the letter which you did me the honor to transmit on the 16th instant <\s>
<s> his majesty relies greatly on the succors of provisions which the government of massachusetts bay may furnish the islands of st pierre and miquelon <\s>
<s> the difficulties which the privateers of the united states have experienced till now in the ports of france either as to the sale of their prizes or to secure their prisoners must cease from the change of circumstances <\s>
<s> i make no doubt on the other hand but that the united states will grant the same facilities to french privateers <\s>
<s> to accomplish this double object i have drafted a plan of regulations which i earnestly request you to examine and to note what you think of it or even to point out such other means as may answer the same purpose so that i may receive his majesty's orders <\s>

<s> sir your excellency's letter of the 29th of july enclosing a plan for a system of regulations for prizes and prisoners we had the honor of receiving in due time and are very sorry it has remained so long unanswered <\s>
<s> in general we are of opinion that the regulations are very good but we beg leave to lay before your excellency the following observations <\s>
<s> upon the 2d article we observe that the extensive jurisdiction of the judges of admiralty in america which considering the local and other circumstances of that country cannot easily be contracted will probably render this regulation impracticable in america <\s>
<s> in france it will as far as we are able to judge of it be very practicable and consequently beneficial <\s>
<s> but we submit to your excellency's consideration whether it would not be better in america after the words _les dites juges to add or the register of the court of admiralty or some other person authorized by the judge <\s>
<s> the jurisdiction of the court of admiralty in america extending for some hundred miles this regulation would be subject to great delays and other inconveniences if it was confined to the judge <\s>
<s> the 4th article seems to be subject to the same inconveniencies and therefore to require the same amendment <\s>
<s> upon the 14th article we beg leave to submit to your excellency's consideration whether the heavy duties upon british merchandise and manufactures if these are to be paid upon prize goods will not operate as a great discouragement to the sale of prizes made by american cruisers and whether it would be consistent with his majesty's interest to permit merchandise and manufactures taken in prizes made by americans to be stored in his majesty's warehouses if you please until they can be exported to america and without being subject to duties <\s>
<s> we know not the expense that will attend these regulations and proceedings in the courts of this kingdom but as the fees of office in america are very moderate and our people have been accustomed to such only we submit to your excellency whether it will not be necessary to state and establish the fees here and make the establishments so far public that americans may be able to inform themselves <\s>
<s> as we are not well instructed in the laws of this kingdom or in the course of the courts of admiralty here it is very possible that some inconveniencies may arise in the practice upon these regulations which we do not at present foresee if they should we shall beg leave to represent them to your excellency and to request his majesty to make the necessary alterations <\s>
<s> we submit these observations to your excellency's superior wisdom and have the honor to be with sentiments of the most perfect respect your excellency's most obedient and most humble servants arthur lee john adams <\s>

<s> gentlemen i have now been five days in this place since my arrival from passy during which time i have neither seen or heard from lieutenant simpson <\s>
<s> but mr hill who was last winter at passy and sailed with me from nantes informs me truly that it is generally reported in the ranger and of course through the french fleet and on shore that i am turned out of the service and that you gentlemen gave mr simpson my place with a captain's commission that my letter of the 16th of july to you was involuntary on my part and in obedience only to your orders to avert dreadful consequences to myself <\s>
<s> these gentlemen are not idle ill-grounded conjectures but melancholy facts therefore i beseech you i conjure you i demand of you to afford me redress--redress by a court martial to form which we have now a sufficient number of officers in france with the assistance of captain hinman exclusive of myself <\s>
<s> the providence and the boston are expected here very soon from nantes and i am certain that they neither can nor will depart again before my friend captain hinman can come down here and it is his unquestioned right to succeed me in the command of the ranger <\s>
<s> i have faithfully and personally supported and fought for the dignified cause of human nature ever since the american banner first waved on the delaware and on the ocean <\s>
<s> this i did when that man did not call himself a republican but left the continent and served its enemies and this i did when that man appeared dastardly backward and did not support me as he ought <\s>
<s> i conclude by requesting you to call before you and examine for your own satisfaction mr edward meyers who is now at the house of the swedish ambassador and who having been with me as a volunteer can and will i am persuaded represent to you the conduct of the officers and men towards me both before i left brest and afterwards in the irish channel as well as my conduct towards them <\s>

<s> at a time when the circumstances of the war may demand the attention of government and without doubt call for so great expense we are sorry to be obliged to request your excellency's advice respecting the subject of money but the nature of the war in america the vast extent of country to defend and this defence having been made chiefly by militia engaged for short periods which often obliged us to pay more men than could be brought into actual service and above all this war having been conducted in the midst of thirteen revolutions of civil government against a nation very powerful both by sea and land has occasioned a very great expense to a country so young and to a government so unsettled <\s>
<s> this has made emissions of paper money indispensable in much larger sums than in the ordinary course of business is necessary or than in any other circumstances would have been politic <\s>
<s> in order to avoid the necessity of further emissions as much as possible the congress have borrowed large sums of this paper money of the possessors upon interest and have promised the lenders payment of that interest in europe and we therefore expect that vessels from america will bring bills of exchange upon us for that interest a large sum of which is now due <\s>
<s> it is very true that our country is already under obligations to his majesty's goodness for considerable sums of money the necessities of the united states have been such that the sums heretofore generously furnished are nearly if not quite expended and when your excellency considers that the american trade has been almost entirely interrupted by the british power at sea they having taken as many of our vessels as to render this trade more advantageous to our enemy than to ourselves that our frigates and other vessels which have arrived in this kingdom have cost us a great sum that the provision of clothing and all the necessaries of war for our army except such as we could make in that country have been shipped from hence at our expense that the expense we have been obliged to incur for our unfortunate countrymen who have been prisoners in england as well as the maintenance of those taken from the enemy has been very considerable your excellency will not be surprised when you are informed that our resources are exhausted <\s>
<s> we therefore hope for the continuance of his majesty's generosity and that the quarterly payment of seven hundred and fifty thousand livres may be continued <\s>
<s> and we assure your excellency that the moment we are furnished with any other means of answering this demand we will no longer trespass on his majesty's goodness <\s>
<s> we have further to inform your excellency that we are empowered and instructed by congress to borrow in europe a sum of money to the amount of two millions sterling which is to be appropriated to the express purpose of redeeming so many of the bills of credit in america as will be sufficient it is apprehended to restore the remainder to their original value <\s>
<s> we therefore request his majesty's permission to borrow such part of that sum in his majesty's kingdom as we may find opportunity <\s>

<s> i am sir with due regard your most humble servant john paul jones <\s>
<s> abraham whipple to john paul jones <\s>
<s> brest august 19 1778 <\s>
<s> sir i am honored with your letter of this day requesting that i will summon a court martial for the trial of lieutenant thomas simpson with whose conduct you have been and are unsatisfied and who you say is under suspension for disobedience to your written orders <\s>
<s> having maturely considered the contents of your letter and with as much accuracy as possible attended to every particular i return for answer the subjoined reasons which will at once explain the impossibility of calling a court martial and fully acquaint you with my sentiments on that subject <\s>
<s> you are sensible that the continental regulations have expressly ordered that a court martial shall consist of at least three captains which is impossible as captain hinman declines to sit he expecting a court of inquiry upon his own conduct on his arrival in america and having assigned a reason of so forcible a nature i think he is acting a part at once prudent and becoming <\s>
<s> you will permit the remark that by lieutenant simpson's parole taken by yourself june 10th 1778 lieutenant simpson engaged on his parole of honor to consider himself as under suspension till he shall be called upon to meet you face to face before a court martial unless you should in the meantime release him from his parole which i conceive that you have done by your letter of the 16th of july to the honorable commissioners where you mention that you are willing to let the dispute drop forever by giving up that parole which would entitle lieutenant simpson to the command of the ranger that this as you bore no malice would be making him all the present satisfaction in your power provided that you had injured him and that you will trust to himself to make an acknowledgment if on the contrary he has injured you <\s>
<s> in my opinion this is giving up his parole in the most ample manner as it does not appear to me that you made by letter or otherwise any compact or agreement with lieutenant simpson that he should make any concessions on his part or any thing of that nature neither that he was to be answerable to a court martial when the supposed crime was blotted out for which he was at first responsible <\s>
<s> i believe that the honorable commissioners accepted it in the same light as by their letter of the same date it would seem you gave them the greatest satisfaction in affording them an opportunity to reinstate lieutenant simpson on board the ranger <\s>
<s> the commissioners further order him to take the command of the ranger as her first lieutenant and to join me and to obey my orders all which sufficiently evinces that lieutenant simpson is no longer considered as under suspension and consequently cannot be responsible to a court martial for disobedience to written orders from you from which he is amply released by your voluntary surrender of his parole <\s>
<s> however if this explanation attempted to be made in the most candid manner should not prove agreeable i beg leave to refer you to the absolute impossibility of calling a court martial agreeable to the resolves of congress and flatter myself that you will believe me to be with due respect sir your most obedient and most humble servant abraham whipple <\s>

<s> passy august 28th 1778 <\s>
<s> sir there are several subjects which we find it necessary to lay before your excellency and to which we have the honor to request your attention <\s>
<s> at a time when the circumstances of the war may demand the attention of government and without doubt call for so great expense we are sorry to be obliged to request your excellency's advice respecting the subject of money but the nature of the war in america the vast extent of country to defend and this defence having been made chiefly by militia engaged for short periods which often obliged us to pay more men than could be brought into actual service and above all this war having been conducted in the midst of thirteen revolutions of civil government against a nation very powerful both by sea and land has occasioned a very great expense to a country so young and to a government so unsettled <\s>
<s> this has made emissions of paper money indispensable in much larger sums than in the ordinary course of business is necessary or than in any other circumstances would have been politic <\s>
<s> in order to avoid the necessity of further emissions as much as possible the congress have borrowed large sums of this paper money of the possessors upon interest and have promised the lenders payment of that interest in europe and we therefore expect that vessels from america will bring bills of exchange upon us for that interest a large sum of which is now due <\s>
<s> it is very true that our country is already under obligations to his majesty's goodness for considerable sums of money the necessities of the united states have been such that the sums heretofore generously furnished are nearly if not quite expended and when your excellency considers that the american trade has been almost entirely interrupted by the british power at sea they having taken as many of our vessels as to render this trade more advantageous to our enemy than to ourselves that our frigates and other vessels which have arrived in this kingdom have cost us a great sum that the provision of clothing and all the necessaries of war for our army except such as we could make in that country have been shipped from hence at our expense that the expense we have been obliged to incur for our unfortunate countrymen who have been prisoners in england as well as the maintenance of those taken from the enemy has been very considerable your excellency will not be surprised when you are informed that our resources are exhausted <\s>
<s> we therefore hope for the continuance of his majesty's generosity and that the quarterly payment of seven hundred and fifty thousand livres may be continued <\s>
<s> and we assure your excellency that the moment we are furnished with any other means of answering this demand we will no longer trespass on his majesty's goodness <\s>
<s> we have further to inform your excellency that we are empowered and instructed by congress to borrow in europe a sum of money to the amount of two millions sterling which is to be appropriated to the express purpose of redeeming so many of the bills of credit in america as will be sufficient it is apprehended to restore the remainder to their original value <\s>
<s> we therefore request his majesty's permission to borrow such part of that sum in his majesty's kingdom as we may find opportunity <\s>
<s> although we are empowered to offer a larger interest than is usually given by his majesty yet that we may not be any interruption to his majesty's service we are willing and desirous of limiting the interest which we may offer to the same that is given by his majesty <\s>
<s> and in this way although most persons will choose to lend their money to his majesty yet there may be others desirous of forming connexions of trade with the people in america who will be willing to serve them in this way <\s>
<s> and perhaps nothing will have a greater tendency to cement the connexion between the two nations so happily begun or to insure to the french nation the benefits of the american trade than something of this kind <\s>

<s> versailles 29th july 1778 <\s>
<s> gentlemen i have received the letter which you did me the honor to transmit on the 16th instant <\s>
<s> his majesty relies greatly on the succors of provisions which the government of massachusetts bay may furnish the islands of st pierre and miquelon <\s>
<s> the difficulties which the privateers of the united states have experienced till now in the ports of france either as to the sale of their prizes or to secure their prisoners must cease from the change of circumstances <\s>
<s> i make no doubt on the other hand but that the united states will grant the same facilities to french privateers <\s>
<s> to accomplish this double object i have drafted a plan of regulations which i earnestly request you to examine and to note what you think of it or even to point out such other means as may answer the same purpose so that i may receive his majesty's orders <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be c <\s>
<s> passy august 13th 1778 <\s>
<s> sir your excellency's letter of the 29th of july enclosing a plan for a system of regulations for prizes and prisoners we had the honor of receiving in due time and are very sorry it has remained so long unanswered <\s>
<s> in general we are of opinion that the regulations are very good but we beg leave to lay before your excellency the following observations <\s>
<s> upon the 2d article we observe that the extensive jurisdiction of the judges of admiralty in america which considering the local and other circumstances of that country cannot easily be contracted will probably render this regulation impracticable in america <\s>
<s> in france it will as far as we are able to judge of it be very practicable and consequently beneficial <\s>
<s> but we submit to your excellency's consideration whether it would not be better in america after the words _les dites juges to add or the register of the court of admiralty or some other person authorized by the judge <\s>
<s> the jurisdiction of the court of admiralty in america extending for some hundred miles this regulation would be subject to great delays and other inconveniences if it was confined to the judge <\s>
<s> the 4th article seems to be subject to the same inconveniencies and therefore to require the same amendment <\s>
<s> upon the 14th article we beg leave to submit to your excellency's consideration whether the heavy duties upon british merchandise and manufactures if these are to be paid upon prize goods will not operate as a great discouragement to the sale of prizes made by american cruisers and whether it would be consistent with his majesty's interest to permit merchandise and manufactures taken in prizes made by americans to be stored in his majesty's warehouses if you please until they can be exported to america and without being subject to duties <\s>
<s> we know not the expense that will attend these regulations and proceedings in the courts of this kingdom but as the fees of office in america are very moderate and our people have been accustomed to such only we submit to your excellency whether it will not be necessary to state and establish the fees here and make the establishments so far public that americans may be able to inform themselves <\s>
<s> as we are not well instructed in the laws of this kingdom or in the course of the courts of admiralty here it is very possible that some inconveniencies may arise in the practice upon these regulations which we do not at present foresee if they should we shall beg leave to represent them to your excellency and to request his majesty to make the necessary alterations <\s>
<s> we submit these observations to your excellency's superior wisdom and have the honor to be with sentiments of the most perfect respect your excellency's most obedient and most humble servants arthur lee john adams <\s>

<s> these gentlemen are not idle ill-grounded conjectures but melancholy facts therefore i beseech you i conjure you i demand of you to afford me redress--redress by a court martial to form which we have now a sufficient number of officers in france with the assistance of captain hinman exclusive of myself <\s>

<s> having maturely considered the contents of your letter and with as much accuracy as possible attended to every particular i return for answer the subjoined reasons which will at once explain the impossibility of calling a court martial and fully acquaint you with my sentiments on that subject <\s>
<s> you are sensible that the continental regulations have expressly ordered that a court martial shall consist of at least three captains which is impossible as captain hinman declines to sit he expecting a court of inquiry upon his own conduct on his arrival in america and having assigned a reason of so forcible a nature i think he is acting a part at once prudent and becoming <\s>
<s> you will permit the remark that by lieutenant simpson's parole taken by yourself june 10th 1778 lieutenant simpson engaged on his parole of honor to consider himself as under suspension till he shall be called upon to meet you face to face before a court martial unless you should in the meantime release him from his parole which i conceive that you have done by your letter of the 16th of july to the honorable commissioners where you mention that you are willing to let the dispute drop forever by giving up that parole which would entitle lieutenant simpson to the command of the ranger that this as you bore no malice would be making him all the present satisfaction in your power provided that you had injured him and that you will trust to himself to make an acknowledgment if on the contrary he has injured you <\s>
<s> in my opinion this is giving up his parole in the most ample manner as it does not appear to me that you made by letter or otherwise any compact or agreement with lieutenant simpson that he should make any concessions on his part or any thing of that nature neither that he was to be answerable to a court martial when the supposed crime was blotted out for which he was at first responsible <\s>
<s> i believe that the honorable commissioners accepted it in the same light as by their letter of the same date it would seem you gave them the greatest satisfaction in affording them an opportunity to reinstate lieutenant simpson on board the ranger <\s>
<s> the commissioners further order him to take the command of the ranger as her first lieutenant and to join me and to obey my orders all which sufficiently evinces that lieutenant simpson is no longer considered as under suspension and consequently cannot be responsible to a court martial for disobedience to written orders from you from which he is amply released by your voluntary surrender of his parole <\s>
<s> however if this explanation attempted to be made in the most candid manner should not prove agreeable i beg leave to refer you to the absolute impossibility of calling a court martial agreeable to the resolves of congress and flatter myself that you will believe me to be with due respect sir your most obedient and most humble servant abraham whipple <\s>

<s> sir there are several subjects which we find it necessary to lay before your excellency and to which we have the honor to request your attention <\s>
<s> at a time when the circumstances of the war may demand the attention of government and without doubt call for so great expense we are sorry to be obliged to request your excellency's advice respecting the subject of money but the nature of the war in america the vast extent of country to defend and this defence having been made chiefly by militia engaged for short periods which often obliged us to pay more men than could be brought into actual service and above all this war having been conducted in the midst of thirteen revolutions of civil government against a nation very powerful both by sea and land has occasioned a very great expense to a country so young and to a government so unsettled <\s>
<s> this has made emissions of paper money indispensable in much larger sums than in the ordinary course of business is necessary or than in any other circumstances would have been politic <\s>
<s> in order to avoid the necessity of further emissions as much as possible the congress have borrowed large sums of this paper money of the possessors upon interest and have promised the lenders payment of that interest in europe and we therefore expect that vessels from america will bring bills of exchange upon us for that interest a large sum of which is now due <\s>
<s> it is very true that our country is already under obligations to his majesty's goodness for considerable sums of money the necessities of the united states have been such that the sums heretofore generously furnished are nearly if not quite expended and when your excellency considers that the american trade has been almost entirely interrupted by the british power at sea they having taken as many of our vessels as to render this trade more advantageous to our enemy than to ourselves that our frigates and other vessels which have arrived in this kingdom have cost us a great sum that the provision of clothing and all the necessaries of war for our army except such as we could make in that country have been shipped from hence at our expense that the expense we have been obliged to incur for our unfortunate countrymen who have been prisoners in england as well as the maintenance of those taken from the enemy has been very considerable your excellency will not be surprised when you are informed that our resources are exhausted <\s>
<s> we therefore hope for the continuance of his majesty's generosity and that the quarterly payment of seven hundred and fifty thousand livres may be continued <\s>
<s> and we assure your excellency that the moment we are furnished with any other means of answering this demand we will no longer trespass on his majesty's goodness <\s>
<s> we have further to inform your excellency that we are empowered and instructed by congress to borrow in europe a sum of money to the amount of two millions sterling which is to be appropriated to the express purpose of redeeming so many of the bills of credit in america as will be sufficient it is apprehended to restore the remainder to their original value <\s>
<s> we therefore request his majesty's permission to borrow such part of that sum in his majesty's kingdom as we may find opportunity <\s>
<s> although we are empowered to offer a larger interest than is usually given by his majesty yet that we may not be any interruption to his majesty's service we are willing and desirous of limiting the interest which we may offer to the same that is given by his majesty <\s>
<s> and in this way although most persons will choose to lend their money to his majesty yet there may be others desirous of forming connexions of trade with the people in america who will be willing to serve them in this way <\s>

<s> upon the 14th article we beg leave to submit to your excellency's consideration whether the heavy duties upon british merchandise and manufactures if these are to be paid upon prize goods will not operate as a great discouragement to the sale of prizes made by american cruisers and whether it would be consistent with his majesty's interest to permit merchandise and manufactures taken in prizes made by americans to be stored in his majesty's warehouses if you please until they can be exported to america and without being subject to duties <\s>

<s> sir we embrace this first opportunity to answer the letter which your excellency did us the honor to address to us the 16th of this month <\s>
<s> we have examined with some attention the alterations which your excellency has made in the 2d and 14th articles of the projected regulations and are of opinion that they will remove the difficulties we apprehended from the first draught <\s>

<s> i am sir with due regard your most humble servant john paul jones <\s>
<s> abraham whipple to john paul jones <\s>
<s> brest august 19 1778 <\s>
<s> sir i am honored with your letter of this day requesting that i will summon a court martial for the trial of lieutenant thomas simpson with whose conduct you have been and are unsatisfied and who you say is under suspension for disobedience to your written orders <\s>
<s> having maturely considered the contents of your letter and with as much accuracy as possible attended to every particular i return for answer the subjoined reasons which will at once explain the impossibility of calling a court martial and fully acquaint you with my sentiments on that subject <\s>
<s> you are sensible that the continental regulations have expressly ordered that a court martial shall consist of at least three captains which is impossible as captain hinman declines to sit he expecting a court of inquiry upon his own conduct on his arrival in america and having assigned a reason of so forcible a nature i think he is acting a part at once prudent and becoming <\s>
<s> you will permit the remark that by lieutenant simpson's parole taken by yourself june 10th 1778 lieutenant simpson engaged on his parole of honor to consider himself as under suspension till he shall be called upon to meet you face to face before a court martial unless you should in the meantime release him from his parole which i conceive that you have done by your letter of the 16th of july to the honorable commissioners where you mention that you are willing to let the dispute drop forever by giving up that parole which would entitle lieutenant simpson to the command of the ranger that this as you bore no malice would be making him all the present satisfaction in your power provided that you had injured him and that you will trust to himself to make an acknowledgment if on the contrary he has injured you <\s>
<s> in my opinion this is giving up his parole in the most ample manner as it does not appear to me that you made by letter or otherwise any compact or agreement with lieutenant simpson that he should make any concessions on his part or any thing of that nature neither that he was to be answerable to a court martial when the supposed crime was blotted out for which he was at first responsible <\s>
<s> i believe that the honorable commissioners accepted it in the same light as by their letter of the same date it would seem you gave them the greatest satisfaction in affording them an opportunity to reinstate lieutenant simpson on board the ranger <\s>
<s> the commissioners further order him to take the command of the ranger as her first lieutenant and to join me and to obey my orders all which sufficiently evinces that lieutenant simpson is no longer considered as under suspension and consequently cannot be responsible to a court martial for disobedience to written orders from you from which he is amply released by your voluntary surrender of his parole <\s>
<s> however if this explanation attempted to be made in the most candid manner should not prove agreeable i beg leave to refer you to the absolute impossibility of calling a court martial agreeable to the resolves of congress and flatter myself that you will believe me to be with due respect sir your most obedient and most humble servant abraham whipple <\s>

<s> sir we have received your letter of the 15th and have written to captain whipple to appoint a court martial for the trial of lieutenant simpson provided there is a sufficient number of officers to constitute one <\s>

<s> passy august 28th 1778 <\s>
<s> sir there are several subjects which we find it necessary to lay before your excellency and to which we have the honor to request your attention <\s>
<s> at a time when the circumstances of the war may demand the attention of government and without doubt call for so great expense we are sorry to be obliged to request your excellency's advice respecting the subject of money but the nature of the war in america the vast extent of country to defend and this defence having been made chiefly by militia engaged for short periods which often obliged us to pay more men than could be brought into actual service and above all this war having been conducted in the midst of thirteen revolutions of civil government against a nation very powerful both by sea and land has occasioned a very great expense to a country so young and to a government so unsettled <\s>
<s> this has made emissions of paper money indispensable in much larger sums than in the ordinary course of business is necessary or than in any other circumstances would have been politic <\s>
<s> in order to avoid the necessity of further emissions as much as possible the congress have borrowed large sums of this paper money of the possessors upon interest and have promised the lenders payment of that interest in europe and we therefore expect that vessels from america will bring bills of exchange upon us for that interest a large sum of which is now due <\s>
<s> it is very true that our country is already under obligations to his majesty's goodness for considerable sums of money the necessities of the united states have been such that the sums heretofore generously furnished are nearly if not quite expended and when your excellency considers that the american trade has been almost entirely interrupted by the british power at sea they having taken as many of our vessels as to render this trade more advantageous to our enemy than to ourselves that our frigates and other vessels which have arrived in this kingdom have cost us a great sum that the provision of clothing and all the necessaries of war for our army except such as we could make in that country have been shipped from hence at our expense that the expense we have been obliged to incur for our unfortunate countrymen who have been prisoners in england as well as the maintenance of those taken from the enemy has been very considerable your excellency will not be surprised when you are informed that our resources are exhausted <\s>
<s> we therefore hope for the continuance of his majesty's generosity and that the quarterly payment of seven hundred and fifty thousand livres may be continued <\s>
<s> and we assure your excellency that the moment we are furnished with any other means of answering this demand we will no longer trespass on his majesty's goodness <\s>
<s> we have further to inform your excellency that we are empowered and instructed by congress to borrow in europe a sum of money to the amount of two millions sterling which is to be appropriated to the express purpose of redeeming so many of the bills of credit in america as will be sufficient it is apprehended to restore the remainder to their original value <\s>
<s> we therefore request his majesty's permission to borrow such part of that sum in his majesty's kingdom as we may find opportunity <\s>
<s> although we are empowered to offer a larger interest than is usually given by his majesty yet that we may not be any interruption to his majesty's service we are willing and desirous of limiting the interest which we may offer to the same that is given by his majesty <\s>
<s> and in this way although most persons will choose to lend their money to his majesty yet there may be others desirous of forming connexions of trade with the people in america who will be willing to serve them in this way <\s>
<s> and perhaps nothing will have a greater tendency to cement the connexion between the two nations so happily begun or to insure to the french nation the benefits of the american trade than something of this kind <\s>

<s> versailles 29th july 1778 <\s>
<s> gentlemen i have received the letter which you did me the honor to transmit on the 16th instant <\s>
<s> his majesty relies greatly on the succors of provisions which the government of massachusetts bay may furnish the islands of st pierre and miquelon <\s>
<s> the difficulties which the privateers of the united states have experienced till now in the ports of france either as to the sale of their prizes or to secure their prisoners must cease from the change of circumstances <\s>
<s> i make no doubt on the other hand but that the united states will grant the same facilities to french privateers <\s>
<s> to accomplish this double object i have drafted a plan of regulations which i earnestly request you to examine and to note what you think of it or even to point out such other means as may answer the same purpose so that i may receive his majesty's orders <\s>
<s> i have the honor to be c <\s>
<s> passy august 13th 1778 <\s>
<s> sir your excellency's letter of the 29th of july enclosing a plan for a system of regulations for prizes and prisoners we had the honor of receiving in due time and are very sorry it has remained so long unanswered <\s>
<s> in general we are of opinion that the regulations are very good but we beg leave to lay before your excellency the following observations <\s>
<s> upon the 2d article we observe that the extensive jurisdiction of the judges of admiralty in america which considering the local and other circumstances of that country cannot easily be contracted will probably render this regulation impracticable in america <\s>
<s> in france it will as far as we are able to judge of it be very practicable and consequently beneficial <\s>
<s> but we submit to your excellency's consideration whether it would not be better in america after the words _les dites juges to add or the register of the court of admiralty or some other person authorized by the judge <\s>
<s> the jurisdiction of the court of admiralty in america extending for some hundred miles this regulation would be subject to great delays and other inconveniences if it was confined to the judge <\s>
<s> the 4th article seems to be subject to the same inconveniencies and therefore to require the same amendment <\s>
<s> upon the 14th article we beg leave to submit to your excellency's consideration whether the heavy duties upon british merchandise and manufactures if these are to be paid upon prize goods will not operate as a great discouragement to the sale of prizes made by american cruisers and whether it would be consistent with his majesty's interest to permit merchandise and manufactures taken in prizes made by americans to be stored in his majesty's warehouses if you please until they can be exported to america and without being subject to duties <\s>
<s> we know not the expense that will attend these regulations and proceedings in the courts of this kingdom but as the fees of office in america are very moderate and our people have been accustomed to such only we submit to your excellency whether it will not be necessary to state and establish the fees here and make the establishments so far public that americans may be able to inform themselves <\s>
<s> as we are not well instructed in the laws of this kingdom or in the course of the courts of admiralty here it is very possible that some inconveniencies may arise in the practice upon these regulations which we do not at present foresee if they should we shall beg leave to represent them to your excellency and to request his majesty to make the necessary alterations <\s>
<s> we submit these observations to your excellency's superior wisdom and have the honor to be with sentiments of the most perfect respect your excellency's most obedient and most humble servants arthur lee john adams <\s>

<s> you will permit the remark that by lieutenant simpson's parole taken by yourself june 10th 1778 lieutenant simpson engaged on his parole of honor to consider himself as under suspension till he shall be called upon to meet you face to face before a court martial unless you should in the meantime release him from his parole which i conceive that you have done by your letter of the 16th of july to the honorable commissioners where you mention that you are willing to let the dispute drop forever by giving up that parole which would entitle lieutenant simpson to the command of the ranger that this as you bore no malice would be making him all the present satisfaction in your power provided that you had injured him and that you will trust to himself to make an acknowledgment if on the contrary he has injured you <\s>
<s> in my opinion this is giving up his parole in the most ample manner as it does not appear to me that you made by letter or otherwise any compact or agreement with lieutenant simpson that he should make any concessions on his part or any thing of that nature neither that he was to be answerable to a court martial when the supposed crime was blotted out for which he was at first responsible <\s>

<s> at a time when the circumstances of the war may demand the attention of government and without doubt call for so great expense we are sorry to be obliged to request your excellency's advice respecting the subject of money but the nature of the war in america the vast extent of country to defend and this defence having been made chiefly by militia engaged for short periods which often obliged us to pay more men than could be brought into actual service and above all this war having been conducted in the midst of thirteen revolutions of civil government against a nation very powerful both by sea and land has occasioned a very great expense to a country so young and to a government so unsettled <\s>
<s> this has made emissions of paper money indispensable in much larger sums than in the ordinary course of business is necessary or than in any other circumstances would have been politic <\s>
<s> in order to avoid the necessity of further emissions as much as possible the congress have borrowed large sums of this paper money of the possessors upon interest and have promised the lenders payment of that interest in europe and we therefore expect that vessels from america will bring bills of exchange upon us for that interest a large sum of which is now due <\s>
<s> it is very true that our country is already under obligations to his majesty's goodness for considerable sums of money the necessities of the united states have been such that the sums heretofore generously furnished are nearly if not quite expended and when your excellency considers that the american trade has been almost entirely interrupted by the british power at sea they having taken as many of our vessels as to render this trade more advantageous to our enemy than to ourselves that our frigates and other vessels which have arrived in this kingdom have cost us a great sum that the provision of clothing and all the necessaries of war for our army except such as we could make in that country have been shipped from hence at our expense that the expense we have been obliged to incur for our unfortunate countrymen who have been prisoners in england as well as the maintenance of those taken from the enemy has been very considerable your excellency will not be surprised when you are informed that our resources are exhausted <\s>
<s> we therefore hope for the continuance of his majesty's generosity and that the quarterly payment of seven hundred and fifty thousand livres may be continued <\s>
<s> and we assure your excellency that the moment we are furnished with any other means of answering this demand we will no longer trespass on his majesty's goodness <\s>
<s> we have further to inform your excellency that we are empowered and instructed by congress to borrow in europe a sum of money to the amount of two millions sterling which is to be appropriated to the express purpose of redeeming so many of the bills of credit in america as will be sufficient it is apprehended to restore the remainder to their original value <\s>
<s> we therefore request his majesty's permission to borrow such part of that sum in his majesty's kingdom as we may find opportunity <\s>
<s> although we are empowered to offer a larger interest than is usually given by his majesty yet that we may not be any interruption to his majesty's service we are willing and desirous of limiting the interest which we may offer to the same that is given by his majesty <\s>

<s> the 4th article seems to be subject to the same inconveniencies and therefore to require the same amendment <\s>
<s> upon the 14th article we beg leave to submit to your excellency's consideration whether the heavy duties upon british merchandise and manufactures if these are to be paid upon prize goods will not operate as a great discouragement to the sale of prizes made by american cruisers and whether it would be consistent with his majesty's interest to permit merchandise and manufactures taken in prizes made by americans to be stored in his majesty's warehouses if you please until they can be exported to america and without being subject to duties <\s>
<s> we know not the expense that will attend these regulations and proceedings in the courts of this kingdom but as the fees of office in america are very moderate and our people have been accustomed to such only we submit to your excellency whether it will not be necessary to state and establish the fees here and make the establishments so far public that americans may be able to inform themselves <\s>
<s> as we are not well instructed in the laws of this kingdom or in the course of the courts of admiralty here it is very possible that some inconveniencies may arise in the practice upon these regulations which we do not at present foresee if they should we shall beg leave to represent them to your excellency and to request his majesty to make the necessary alterations <\s>

<s> i am sir with due regard your most humble servant john paul jones <\s>
<s> abraham whipple to john paul jones <\s>
<s> brest august 19 1778 <\s>
<s> sir i am honored with your letter of this day requesting that i will summon a court martial for the trial of lieutenant thomas simpson with whose conduct you have been and are unsatisfied and who you say is under suspension for disobedience to your written orders <\s>
<s> having maturely considered the contents of your letter and with as much accuracy as possible attended to every particular i return for answer the subjoined reasons which will at once explain the impossibility of calling a court martial and fully acquaint you with my sentiments on that subject <\s>
<s> you are sensible that the continental regulations have expressly ordered that a court martial shall consist of at least three captains which is impossible as captain hinman declines to sit he expecting a court of inquiry upon his own conduct on his arrival in america and having assigned a reason of so forcible a nature i think he is acting a part at once prudent and becoming <\s>
<s> you will permit the remark that by lieutenant simpson's parole taken by yourself june 10th 1778 lieutenant simpson engaged on his parole of honor to consider himself as under suspension till he shall be called upon to meet you face to face before a court martial unless you should in the meantime release him from his parole which i conceive that you have done by your letter of the 16th of july to the honorable commissioners where you mention that you are willing to let the dispute drop forever by giving up that parole which would entitle lieutenant simpson to the command of the ranger that this as you bore no malice would be making him all the present satisfaction in your power provided that you had injured him and that you will trust to himself to make an acknowledgment if on the contrary he has injured you <\s>
<s> in my opinion this is giving up his parole in the most ample manner as it does not appear to me that you made by letter or otherwise any compact or agreement with lieutenant simpson that he should make any concessions on his part or any thing of that nature neither that he was to be answerable to a court martial when the supposed crime was blotted out for which he was at first responsible <\s>
<s> i believe that the honorable commissioners accepted it in the same light as by their letter of the same date it would seem you gave them the greatest satisfaction in affording them an opportunity to reinstate lieutenant simpson on board the ranger <\s>
<s> the commissioners further order him to take the command of the ranger as her first lieutenant and to join me and to obey my orders all which sufficiently evinces that lieutenant simpson is no longer considered as under suspension and consequently cannot be responsible to a court martial for disobedience to written orders from you from which he is amply released by your voluntary surrender of his parole <\s>
<s> however if this explanation attempted to be made in the most candid manner should not prove agreeable i beg leave to refer you to the absolute impossibility of calling a court martial agreeable to the resolves of congress and flatter myself that you will believe me to be with due respect sir your most obedient and most humble servant abraham whipple <\s>

<s> sir there are several subjects which we find it necessary to lay before your excellency and to which we have the honor to request your attention <\s>
<s> at a time when the circumstances of the war may demand the attention of government and without doubt call for so great expense we are sorry to be obliged to request your excellency's advice respecting the subject of money but the nature of the war in america the vast extent of country to defend and this defence having been made chiefly by militia engaged for short periods which often obliged us to pay more men than could be brought into actual service and above all this war having been conducted in the midst of thirteen revolutions of civil government against a nation very powerful both by sea and land has occasioned a very great expense to a country so young and to a government so unsettled <\s>
<s> this has made emissions of paper money indispensable in much larger sums than in the ordinary course of business is necessary or than in any other circumstances would have been politic <\s>
<s> in order to avoid the necessity of further emissions as much as possible the congress have borrowed large sums of this paper money of the possessors upon interest and have promised the lenders payment of that interest in europe and we therefore expect that vessels from america will bring bills of exchange upon us for that interest a large sum of which is now due <\s>
<s> it is very true that our country is already under obligations to his majesty's goodness for considerable sums of money the necessities of the united states have been such that the sums heretofore generously furnished are nearly if not quite expended and when your excellency considers that the american trade has been almost entirely interrupted by the british power at sea they having taken as many of our vessels as to render this trade more advantageous to our enemy than to ourselves that our frigates and other vessels which have arrived in this kingdom have cost us a great sum that the provision of clothing and all the necessaries of war for our army except such as we could make in that country have been shipped from hence at our expense that the expense we have been obliged to incur for our unfortunate countrymen who have been prisoners in england as well as the maintenance of those taken from the enemy has been very considerable your excellency will not be surprised when you are informed that our resources are exhausted <\s>
<s> we therefore hope for the continuance of his majesty's generosity and that the quarterly payment of seven hundred and fifty thousand livres may be continued <\s>
<s> and we assure your excellency that the moment we are furnished with any other means of answering this demand we will no longer trespass on his majesty's goodness <\s>
<s> we have further to inform your excellency that we are empowered and instructed by congress to borrow in europe a sum of money to the amount of two millions sterling which is to be appropriated to the express purpose of redeeming so many of the bills of credit in america as will be sufficient it is apprehended to restore the remainder to their original value <\s>
<s> we therefore request his majesty's permission to borrow such part of that sum in his majesty's kingdom as we may find opportunity <\s>
<s> although we are empowered to offer a larger interest than is usually given by his majesty yet that we may not be any interruption to his majesty's service we are willing and desirous of limiting the interest which we may offer to the same that is given by his majesty <\s>
<s> and in this way although most persons will choose to lend their money to his majesty yet there may be others desirous of forming connexions of trade with the people in america who will be willing to serve them in this way <\s>
<s> and perhaps nothing will have a greater tendency to cement the connexion between the two nations so happily begun or to insure to the french nation the benefits of the american trade than something of this kind <\s>

<s> i make no doubt on the other hand but that the united states will grant the same facilities to french privateers <\s>

<s> in general we are of opinion that the regulations are very good but we beg leave to lay before your excellency the following observations <\s>
<s> upon the 2d article we observe that the extensive jurisdiction of the judges of admiralty in america which considering the local and other circumstances of that country cannot easily be contracted will probably render this regulation impracticable in america <\s>
<s> in france it will as far as we are able to judge of it be very practicable and consequently beneficial <\s>
<s> but we submit to your excellency's consideration whether it would not be better in america after the words _les dites juges to add or the register of the court of admiralty or some other person authorized by the judge <\s>
<s> the jurisdiction of the court of admiralty in america extending for some hundred miles this regulation would be subject to great delays and other inconveniences if it was confined to the judge <\s>
<s> the 4th article seems to be subject to the same inconveniencies and therefore to require the same amendment <\s>
<s> upon the 14th article we beg leave to submit to your excellency's consideration whether the heavy duties upon british merchandise and manufactures if these are to be paid upon prize goods will not operate as a great discouragement to the sale of prizes made by american cruisers and whether it would be consistent with his majesty's interest to permit merchandise and manufactures taken in prizes made by americans to be stored in his majesty's warehouses if you please until they can be exported to america and without being subject to duties <\s>

<s> at a time when the circumstances of the war may demand the attention of government and without doubt call for so great expense we are sorry to be obliged to request your excellency's advice respecting the subject of money but the nature of the war in america the vast extent of country to defend and this defence having been made chiefly by militia engaged for short periods which often obliged us to pay more men than could be brought into actual service and above all this war having been conducted in the midst of thirteen revolutions of civil government against a nation very powerful both by sea and land has occasioned a very great expense to a country so young and to a government so unsettled <\s>
<s> this has made emissions of paper money indispensable in much larger sums than in the ordinary course of business is necessary or than in any other circumstances would have been politic <\s>
<s> in order to avoid the necessity of further emissions as much as possible the congress have borrowed large sums of this paper money of the possessors upon interest and have promised the lenders payment of that interest in europe and we therefore expect that vessels from america will bring bills of exchange upon us for that interest a large sum of which is now due <\s>
<s> it is very true that our country is already under obligations to his majesty's goodness for considerable sums of money the necessities of the united states have been such that the sums heretofore generously furnished are nearly if not quite expended and when your excellency considers that the american trade has been almost entirely interrupted by the british power at sea they having taken as many of our vessels as to render this trade more advantageous to our enemy than to ourselves that our frigates and other vessels which have arrived in this kingdom have cost us a great sum that the provision of clothing and all the necessaries of war for our army except such as we could make in that country have been shipped from hence at our expense that the expense we have been obliged to incur for our unfortunate countrymen who have been prisoners in england as well as the maintenance of those taken from the enemy has been very considerable your excellency will not be surprised when you are informed that our resources are exhausted <\s>
<s> we therefore hope for the continuance of his majesty's generosity and that the quarterly payment of seven hundred and fifty thousand livres may be continued <\s>
<s> and we assure your excellency that the moment we are furnished with any other means of answering this demand we will no longer trespass on his majesty's goodness <\s>
<s> we have further to inform your excellency that we are empowered and instructed by congress to borrow in europe a sum of money to the amount of two millions sterling which is to be appropriated to the express purpose of redeeming so many of the bills of credit in america as will be sufficient it is apprehended to restore the remainder to their original value <\s>
<s> we therefore request his majesty's permission to borrow such part of that sum in his majesty's kingdom as we may find opportunity <\s>

<s> sir your excellency's letter of the 29th of july enclosing a plan for a system of regulations for prizes and prisoners we had the honor of receiving in due time and are very sorry it has remained so long unanswered <\s>
<s> in general we are of opinion that the regulations are very good but we beg leave to lay before your excellency the following observations <\s>
<s> upon the 2d article we observe that the extensive jurisdiction of the judges of admiralty in america which considering the local and other circumstances of that country cannot easily be contracted will probably render this regulation impracticable in america <\s>
<s> in france it will as far as we are able to judge of it be very practicable and consequently beneficial <\s>
<s> but we submit to your excellency's consideration whether it would not be better in america after the words _les dites juges to add or the register of the court of admiralty or some other person authorized by the judge <\s>
<s> the jurisdiction of the court of admiralty in america extending for some hundred miles this regulation would be subject to great delays and other inconveniences if it was confined to the judge <\s>
<s> the 4th article seems to be subject to the same inconveniencies and therefore to require the same amendment <\s>
<s> upon the 14th article we beg leave to submit to your excellency's consideration whether the heavy duties upon british merchandise and manufactures if these are to be paid upon prize goods will not operate as a great discouragement to the sale of prizes made by american cruisers and whether it would be consistent with his majesty's interest to permit merchandise and manufactures taken in prizes made by americans to be stored in his majesty's warehouses if you please until they can be exported to america and without being subject to duties <\s>
<s> we know not the expense that will attend these regulations and proceedings in the courts of this kingdom but as the fees of office in america are very moderate and our people have been accustomed to such only we submit to your excellency whether it will not be necessary to state and establish the fees here and make the establishments so far public that americans may be able to inform themselves <\s>
<s> as we are not well instructed in the laws of this kingdom or in the course of the courts of admiralty here it is very possible that some inconveniencies may arise in the practice upon these regulations which we do not at present foresee if they should we shall beg leave to represent them to your excellency and to request his majesty to make the necessary alterations <\s>

<s> these gentlemen are not idle ill-grounded conjectures but melancholy facts therefore i beseech you i conjure you i demand of you to afford me redress--redress by a court martial to form which we have now a sufficient number of officers in france with the assistance of captain hinman exclusive of myself <\s>

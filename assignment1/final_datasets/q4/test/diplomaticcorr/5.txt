<s> gentlemen your declaration of the fourth of july last has given this court as well as several others in europe reason to expect you would in form announce your independency to them and ask their friendship but a three months silence on that subject appears to them mysterious and the more so as you declared for foreign alliances <\s>

<s> paris 1st october 1776 <\s>
<s> gentlemen mr morris's letters of the 4th and 5th of june last 5 on politics and business i received with the duplicates of my commission and instructions on the 25th ult <\s>
<s> i stand corrected and confine myself to politics <\s>
<s> your letter found me in a most critical situation the ministry had become extremely uneasy at your absolute silence and the bold assertions of the british ambassador that you were accommodating matters aided by the black and villainous artifices of one or two of our own countrymen here had brought them to apprehend not only a settlement between the two countries but the most serious consequences to their west india islands should we unite again with great britain <\s>
<s> i had nothing left but to make the most positive assertions that no accommodation would or could take place and to pledge myself in the strongest possible manner that thus would turn out the event yet so strong were their apprehensions that an order was issued to suspend furnishing me with stores <\s>
<s> think what i must feel upon such an occasion <\s>
<s> beaumarchais exerted himself and in a day or two obtained the orders to be countermanded and every thing is again running on favorably <\s>
<s> for heaven's sake if you mean to have any connexion with this kingdom be more assiduous in getting your letters here <\s>
<s> i know not where the blame lies but it must lie heavy somewhere when vessels are suffered to sail from philadelphia and other ports quite down to the middle of august without a single line <\s>
<s> this circumstance was urged against my assertions and was near proving a mortal stab to my whole proceedings <\s>
<s> one mr hopkins of maryland in this service and who is in the rank of brigadier general appeared desirous of going to america but on my not paying him the regard he vainly thought himself entitled to he formed the dark design of defeating at one stroke my whole prospects as to supplies <\s>
<s> at this critical period he pretended to be in my secrets and roundly asserted that i had solely in view a reconciliation with great britain immediately after which the stores now furnishing would be used against france <\s>
<s> this coming from a professed enemy of great britain from a native of america from one who professed himself a zealous friend to the colonies you must suppose had weight <\s>
<s> however thunderstruck i was as well as my friend m <\s>
<s> beaumarchais at this unexpected and last effort of treachery we exerted ourselves and truth prevailed <\s>
<s> the mischief has recoiled on himself and having fallen into disgrace here he will strive to get to america where he threatens i hear to do much mischief to me <\s>
<s> however he will not probably be permitted to depart unless he slips off very privately <\s>
<s> should that be the case or should he write letters you have now a clue to unravel him and his proceedings <\s>
<s> it would be too tedious to recount what i have met with in this way <\s>
<s> it has not only confined me to paris but to my chamber and pen for some weeks past in drawing up by way of memorial the true state of the colonies their interests the system of policy they must unquestionably pursue and showing that the highest interests of france are inseparably connected therewith <\s>
<s> i do not mention a single difficulty with one complaining thought for myself my all is devoted and i am happy in being so far successful and that the machinations of my enemies or rather the enemies of my country have given me finally an opportunity of experiencing the friendship and protection of great and valuable men but it is necessary that you should know as much as possible of my situation <\s>
<s> the stores are collecting and i hope will be embarked by the middle of this month if later i shall incline to send them by martinique on account of the season <\s>
<s> it is consistent with a political letter to urge the remittance of the fourteen thousand hogsheads of tobacco written for formerly in part payment of these stores if you make it twenty the public will be the gainers as the article is rising fast <\s>
<s> you are desired by no means to forget bermuda if you should great britain will seize it this winter or france on the first rupture having been made sensible of its importance by the officious zeal of that same mr h <\s>
<s> as your navy is increasing will you commission me to send you duck for twenty or thirty sail <\s>
<s> i can procure it for you to the northward on very good terms and you have on hand the produce wanted to pay for it with <\s>
<s> have you granted commissions against the portuguese <\s>
<s> all the friends to america in europe call loudly for such a measure <\s>
<s> would you have universal commerce commission some person to visit every kingdom on the continent that can hold any commerce with america <\s>
<s> among them by no means forget prussia <\s>
<s> grain will be in demand in this kingdom and in the south of europe <\s>
<s> permit me again to urge an increase of the navy <\s>
<s> great britain is calling in her mediterranean passes to expose us to the algerines <\s>
<s> i propose applying to this court on that subject <\s>
<s> doctor bancroft of london merits much of the colonies <\s>
<s> as i shall now have frequent opportunities of writing by officers and others going out i will not add more than that mr carmichael has now been with me some time recommended by mr a <\s>
<s> i owe much to him for his assistance in my despatches and for his friendly and seasonable advice upon all occasions <\s>
<s> he is of maryland and is here for his health and proposes going soon to america <\s>
<s> i expect to hear from london tomorrow by dr b <\s>
<s> who is on his way here <\s>
<s> i am with my most sincere respect and esteem for the secret committee and most profound regard to the congress your most obedient and very humble servant silas deane <\s>
<s> s an agent from barbadoes is arrived in london to represent their distresses another from bermuda with a declaration to the ministry of the necessity of their being supplied with provisions from the colonies and saying that if not permitted they must ask the protection of congress <\s>
<s> i have to urge your sending to me either a general power for the purpose or a number of blank commissions for vessels of war <\s>
<s> it is an object of the last importance for in this time of peace between the nations of europe i can be acquainted with the time of every vessel's sailing either from england or portugal and by despatching little vessels armed from hence and to appearance property of the citizens of the united states of america to seize them while unsuspicious on this coast and to stand directly for america with them great reprisals may be made and persons of the first property have already solicited me on the occasion <\s>
<s> indeed they have such an opinion of my power that they have offered to engage in such an adventure if i would authorise them with my name but this might as yet be rather dangerous it is certainly however a very practicable and safe plan to arm a ship here as if for the coast of africa or the west indies wait until some ship of value is sailing from england or portugal slip out at once and carry them on to america <\s>
<s> when arrived the armed vessel increases your navy and the prize supplies the country <\s>
<s> it is of importance as i have mentioned in my former letters to have some one deputed and empowered to treat with the king of prussia <\s>
<s> i am acquainted with his agent here and have already through him received some queries and proposals respecting american commerce to which i am preparing a reply <\s>
<s> i have also an acquaintance with the agent of the grand duke of tuscany who proposes fixing a commerce between the united states and leghorn but has not as yet given me his particular thoughts <\s>
<s> france and spain are naturally our allies the italian states want our flour and some other articles prussia ever pursuing her own interests needs but be informed of some facts relative to america's increasing commerce to favor us holland will pursue its system now fixed of never quarrelling with any one on any occasion whatever <\s>
<s> in this view is seen at once the power we ought to apply to and gain a good acquaintance with <\s>
<s> let me again urge you on the subject of tobacco <\s>
<s> receive also from me another hint <\s>
<s> it is this if you would apportion a certain tract of the western lands to be divided at the close of this war among the officers and soldiers serving in it and make a generous allotment it would i think have a good effect in america as the poorest soldiers would then be fighting literally for a freehold and in europe it would operate beyond any pecuniary offers <\s>

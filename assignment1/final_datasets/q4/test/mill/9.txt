<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>

<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>
<s> the principle is understood in its application to any one employment but not to the general mass of employment <\s>
<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>
<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from different degrees of attractiveness in different employments <\s>
<s> in treating of wages we have hitherto confined ourselves to the causes which operate on them generally and en masse the laws which govern the remuneration of ordinary or average labor without reference to the existence of different kinds of work which are habitually paid at different rates depending in some degree on different laws <\s>
<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>
<s> honor makes a great part of the reward of all honorable professions <\s>
<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>
<s> if the chances are great of total failure the reward in case of success must be sufficient to make up in the general estimation for those adverse chances <\s>

<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>
<s> it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages <\s>
<s> there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live <\s>
<s> we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week <\s>
<s> shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten <\s>
<s> but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication <\s>
<s> their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay <\s>
<s> receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings <\s>
<s> they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once <\s>
<s> it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before <\s>
<s> the operation of a low standard upon the wages of those in the community who have a higher one has been seen in the united states to a certain extent by the landing on our shores of chinese laborers who maintain a decidedly lower standard of living than either their american or irish competitors <\s>
<s> if they come in such numbers as to retain their lower standard by forming a group by themselves and are thereby not assimilated into the body of laborers who have a higher standard of comfort they can to the extent of their ability to do work drive other laborers out of employment <\s>

<s> but let us try to imagine what would happen if the idea became general among the laboring class that the competition of too great numbers was the principal cause of their poverty <\s>
<s> we are often told that the most thorough perception of the dependence of wages on population will not influence the conduct of a laboring man because it is not the children he himself can have that will produce any effect in generally depressing the labor market <\s>
<s> true and it is also true that one soldiers running away will not lose the battle accordingly it is not that consideration which keeps each soldier in his rank it is the disgrace which naturally and inevitably attends on conduct by any one individual which if pursued by a majority everybody can see would be fatal <\s>
<s> men are seldom found to brave the general opinion of their class unless supported either by some principle higher than regard for opinion or by some strong body of opinion elsewhere <\s>
<s> if the opinion were once generally established among the laboring class that their welfare required a due regulation of the numbers of families the respectable and well conducted of the body would conform to the prescription and only those would exempt themselves from it who were in the habit of making light of social obligations generally and there would be then an evident justification for converting the moral obligation against bringing children into the world who are a burden to the community into a legal one just as in many other cases of the progress of opinion the law ends by enforcing against recalcitrant minorities obligations which to be useful must be general and which from a sense of their utility a large majority have voluntarily consented to take upon themselves <\s>
<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>
<s> it is familiar to all trades unions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices <\s>
<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>
<s> the principle is understood in its application to any one employment but not to the general mass of employment <\s>
<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>
<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from different degrees of attractiveness in different employments <\s>
<s> in treating of wages we have hitherto confined ourselves to the causes which operate on them generally and en masse the laws which govern the remuneration of ordinary or average labor without reference to the existence of different kinds of work which are habitually paid at different rates depending in some degree on different laws <\s>
<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>
<s> honor makes a great part of the reward of all honorable professions <\s>
<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>
<s> if the chances are great of total failure the reward in case of success must be sufficient to make up in the general estimation for those adverse chances <\s>

<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>

<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>

<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>
<s> the principle is understood in its application to any one employment but not to the general mass of employment <\s>
<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>
<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>

<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>

<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>

<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>

<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>
<s> honor makes a great part of the reward of all honorable professions <\s>
<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>
<s> if the chances are great of total failure the reward in case of success must be sufficient to make up in the general estimation for those adverse chances <\s>

<s> the soil was ill cultivated by pauper labor and its rental consumed by parish rates <\s>
<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>
<s> it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages <\s>
<s> there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live <\s>
<s> we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week <\s>
<s> shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten <\s>
<s> but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication <\s>
<s> their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay <\s>
<s> receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings <\s>
<s> they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once <\s>
<s> it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before <\s>
<s> the operation of a low standard upon the wages of those in the community who have a higher one has been seen in the united states to a certain extent by the landing on our shores of chinese laborers who maintain a decidedly lower standard of living than either their american or irish competitors <\s>
<s> if they come in such numbers as to retain their lower standard by forming a group by themselves and are thereby not assimilated into the body of laborers who have a higher standard of comfort they can to the extent of their ability to do work drive other laborers out of employment <\s>
<s> this moreover is exactly what was done by the irish who drove americans out of the mills of new england and who are now being driven out probably by the french canadians with a standard lower than the irish <\s>

<s> it will be noted how many come in the prime of life and how few children and females there are <\s>
<s> it need hardly be said that the economic side of a question is here discussed which requires for its solution many ethical and political considerations besides <\s>
<s> grounds for expecting improvement in public opinion on the subject of population <\s>
<s> by what means then is poverty to be contended against <\s>
<s> how is the evil of low wages to be remedied <\s>
<s> if the expedients usually recommended for the purpose are not adapted to it can no others be thought of <\s>
<s> is the problem incapable of solution <\s>
<s> can political economy do nothing but only object to everything and demonstrate that nothing can be done <\s>
<s> those who think it hopeless that the laboring classes should be induced to practice a sufficient degree of prudence in regard to the increase of their families because they have hitherto stopped short of that point show an inability to estimate the ordinary principles of human action <\s>
<s> nothing more would probably be necessary to secure that result than an opinion generally diffused that it was desirable <\s>
<s> but let us try to imagine what would happen if the idea became general among the laboring class that the competition of too great numbers was the principal cause of their poverty <\s>
<s> we are often told that the most thorough perception of the dependence of wages on population will not influence the conduct of a laboring man because it is not the children he himself can have that will produce any effect in generally depressing the labor market <\s>
<s> true and it is also true that one soldiers running away will not lose the battle accordingly it is not that consideration which keeps each soldier in his rank it is the disgrace which naturally and inevitably attends on conduct by any one individual which if pursued by a majority everybody can see would be fatal <\s>
<s> men are seldom found to brave the general opinion of their class unless supported either by some principle higher than regard for opinion or by some strong body of opinion elsewhere <\s>
<s> if the opinion were once generally established among the laboring class that their welfare required a due regulation of the numbers of families the respectable and well conducted of the body would conform to the prescription and only those would exempt themselves from it who were in the habit of making light of social obligations generally and there would be then an evident justification for converting the moral obligation against bringing children into the world who are a burden to the community into a legal one just as in many other cases of the progress of opinion the law ends by enforcing against recalcitrant minorities obligations which to be useful must be general and which from a sense of their utility a large majority have voluntarily consented to take upon themselves <\s>
<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>
<s> it is familiar to all trades unions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices <\s>
<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>
<s> the principle is understood in its application to any one employment but not to the general mass of employment <\s>
<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>

<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>

<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>

<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>

<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>
<s> it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages <\s>
<s> there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live <\s>
<s> we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week <\s>
<s> shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten <\s>
<s> but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication <\s>
<s> their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay <\s>
<s> receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings <\s>
<s> they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once <\s>
<s> it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before <\s>
<s> the operation of a low standard upon the wages of those in the community who have a higher one has been seen in the united states to a certain extent by the landing on our shores of chinese laborers who maintain a decidedly lower standard of living than either their american or irish competitors <\s>
<s> if they come in such numbers as to retain their lower standard by forming a group by themselves and are thereby not assimilated into the body of laborers who have a higher standard of comfort they can to the extent of their ability to do work drive other laborers out of employment <\s>
<s> this moreover is exactly what was done by the irish who drove americans out of the mills of new england and who are now being driven out probably by the french canadians with a standard lower than the irish <\s>

<s> by what means then is poverty to be contended against <\s>
<s> how is the evil of low wages to be remedied <\s>
<s> if the expedients usually recommended for the purpose are not adapted to it can no others be thought of <\s>
<s> is the problem incapable of solution <\s>
<s> can political economy do nothing but only object to everything and demonstrate that nothing can be done <\s>
<s> those who think it hopeless that the laboring classes should be induced to practice a sufficient degree of prudence in regard to the increase of their families because they have hitherto stopped short of that point show an inability to estimate the ordinary principles of human action <\s>
<s> nothing more would probably be necessary to secure that result than an opinion generally diffused that it was desirable <\s>
<s> but let us try to imagine what would happen if the idea became general among the laboring class that the competition of too great numbers was the principal cause of their poverty <\s>
<s> we are often told that the most thorough perception of the dependence of wages on population will not influence the conduct of a laboring man because it is not the children he himself can have that will produce any effect in generally depressing the labor market <\s>
<s> true and it is also true that one soldiers running away will not lose the battle accordingly it is not that consideration which keeps each soldier in his rank it is the disgrace which naturally and inevitably attends on conduct by any one individual which if pursued by a majority everybody can see would be fatal <\s>
<s> men are seldom found to brave the general opinion of their class unless supported either by some principle higher than regard for opinion or by some strong body of opinion elsewhere <\s>
<s> if the opinion were once generally established among the laboring class that their welfare required a due regulation of the numbers of families the respectable and well conducted of the body would conform to the prescription and only those would exempt themselves from it who were in the habit of making light of social obligations generally and there would be then an evident justification for converting the moral obligation against bringing children into the world who are a burden to the community into a legal one just as in many other cases of the progress of opinion the law ends by enforcing against recalcitrant minorities obligations which to be useful must be general and which from a sense of their utility a large majority have voluntarily consented to take upon themselves <\s>
<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>
<s> it is familiar to all trades unions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices <\s>
<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>
<s> the principle is understood in its application to any one employment but not to the general mass of employment <\s>
<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>

<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>

<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from different degrees of attractiveness in different employments <\s>
<s> in treating of wages we have hitherto confined ourselves to the causes which operate on them generally and en masse the laws which govern the remuneration of ordinary or average labor without reference to the existence of different kinds of work which are habitually paid at different rates depending in some degree on different laws <\s>
<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>
<s> honor makes a great part of the reward of all honorable professions <\s>
<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>

<s> 4    the wages of labor vary according to the small or great trust which must be reposed in the workmen <\s>
<s> the soil was ill cultivated by pauper labor and its rental consumed by parish rates <\s>
<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>
<s> it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages <\s>
<s> there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live <\s>
<s> we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week <\s>
<s> shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten <\s>
<s> but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication <\s>
<s> their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay <\s>
<s> receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings <\s>
<s> they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once <\s>
<s> it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before <\s>
<s> the operation of a low standard upon the wages of those in the community who have a higher one has been seen in the united states to a certain extent by the landing on our shores of chinese laborers who maintain a decidedly lower standard of living than either their american or irish competitors <\s>
<s> if they come in such numbers as to retain their lower standard by forming a group by themselves and are thereby not assimilated into the body of laborers who have a higher standard of comfort they can to the extent of their ability to do work drive other laborers out of employment <\s>
<s> this moreover is exactly what was done by the irish who drove americans out of the mills of new england and who are now being driven out probably by the french canadians with a standard lower than the irish <\s>

<s> it will be noted how many come in the prime of life and how few children and females there are <\s>
<s> it need hardly be said that the economic side of a question is here discussed which requires for its solution many ethical and political considerations besides <\s>
<s> grounds for expecting improvement in public opinion on the subject of population <\s>
<s> by what means then is poverty to be contended against <\s>
<s> how is the evil of low wages to be remedied <\s>
<s> if the expedients usually recommended for the purpose are not adapted to it can no others be thought of <\s>
<s> is the problem incapable of solution <\s>
<s> can political economy do nothing but only object to everything and demonstrate that nothing can be done <\s>
<s> those who think it hopeless that the laboring classes should be induced to practice a sufficient degree of prudence in regard to the increase of their families because they have hitherto stopped short of that point show an inability to estimate the ordinary principles of human action <\s>
<s> nothing more would probably be necessary to secure that result than an opinion generally diffused that it was desirable <\s>
<s> but let us try to imagine what would happen if the idea became general among the laboring class that the competition of too great numbers was the principal cause of their poverty <\s>
<s> we are often told that the most thorough perception of the dependence of wages on population will not influence the conduct of a laboring man because it is not the children he himself can have that will produce any effect in generally depressing the labor market <\s>
<s> true and it is also true that one soldiers running away will not lose the battle accordingly it is not that consideration which keeps each soldier in his rank it is the disgrace which naturally and inevitably attends on conduct by any one individual which if pursued by a majority everybody can see would be fatal <\s>
<s> men are seldom found to brave the general opinion of their class unless supported either by some principle higher than regard for opinion or by some strong body of opinion elsewhere <\s>
<s> if the opinion were once generally established among the laboring class that their welfare required a due regulation of the numbers of families the respectable and well conducted of the body would conform to the prescription and only those would exempt themselves from it who were in the habit of making light of social obligations generally and there would be then an evident justification for converting the moral obligation against bringing children into the world who are a burden to the community into a legal one just as in many other cases of the progress of opinion the law ends by enforcing against recalcitrant minorities obligations which to be useful must be general and which from a sense of their utility a large majority have voluntarily consented to take upon themselves <\s>
<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>
<s> it is familiar to all trades unions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices <\s>
<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>
<s> the principle is understood in its application to any one employment but not to the general mass of employment <\s>
<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>

<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>
<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from different degrees of attractiveness in different employments <\s>
<s> in treating of wages we have hitherto confined ourselves to the causes which operate on them generally and en masse the laws which govern the remuneration of ordinary or average labor without reference to the existence of different kinds of work which are habitually paid at different rates depending in some degree on different laws <\s>
<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>
<s> honor makes a great part of the reward of all honorable professions <\s>
<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>
<s> if the chances are great of total failure the reward in case of success must be sufficient to make up in the general estimation for those adverse chances <\s>
<s> put your son apprentice to a shoemaker there is little doubt of his learning to make a pair of shoes but send him to study the law it is at least twenty to one if ever he makes such proficiency as will enable him to live by the business <\s>

<s> 4    the wages of labor vary according to the small or great trust which must be reposed in the workmen <\s>
<s> the soil was ill cultivated by pauper labor and its rental consumed by parish rates <\s>
<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>
<s> it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages <\s>
<s> there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live <\s>
<s> we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week <\s>
<s> shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten <\s>
<s> but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication <\s>
<s> their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay <\s>
<s> receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings <\s>
<s> they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once <\s>
<s> it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before <\s>
<s> the operation of a low standard upon the wages of those in the community who have a higher one has been seen in the united states to a certain extent by the landing on our shores of chinese laborers who maintain a decidedly lower standard of living than either their american or irish competitors <\s>
<s> if they come in such numbers as to retain their lower standard by forming a group by themselves and are thereby not assimilated into the body of laborers who have a higher standard of comfort they can to the extent of their ability to do work drive other laborers out of employment <\s>
<s> this moreover is exactly what was done by the irish who drove americans out of the mills of new england and who are now being driven out probably by the french canadians with a standard lower than the irish <\s>
<s> the chinese come here now without their families as may be seen by the accompanying diagram in which the shaded side represents the males on the left and the unshaded the females on the right of the perpendicular line <\s>

<s> it will be noted how many come in the prime of life and how few children and females there are <\s>
<s> it need hardly be said that the economic side of a question is here discussed which requires for its solution many ethical and political considerations besides <\s>
<s> grounds for expecting improvement in public opinion on the subject of population <\s>
<s> by what means then is poverty to be contended against <\s>
<s> how is the evil of low wages to be remedied <\s>
<s> if the expedients usually recommended for the purpose are not adapted to it can no others be thought of <\s>
<s> is the problem incapable of solution <\s>
<s> can political economy do nothing but only object to everything and demonstrate that nothing can be done <\s>
<s> those who think it hopeless that the laboring classes should be induced to practice a sufficient degree of prudence in regard to the increase of their families because they have hitherto stopped short of that point show an inability to estimate the ordinary principles of human action <\s>
<s> nothing more would probably be necessary to secure that result than an opinion generally diffused that it was desirable <\s>
<s> but let us try to imagine what would happen if the idea became general among the laboring class that the competition of too great numbers was the principal cause of their poverty <\s>
<s> we are often told that the most thorough perception of the dependence of wages on population will not influence the conduct of a laboring man because it is not the children he himself can have that will produce any effect in generally depressing the labor market <\s>
<s> true and it is also true that one soldiers running away will not lose the battle accordingly it is not that consideration which keeps each soldier in his rank it is the disgrace which naturally and inevitably attends on conduct by any one individual which if pursued by a majority everybody can see would be fatal <\s>
<s> men are seldom found to brave the general opinion of their class unless supported either by some principle higher than regard for opinion or by some strong body of opinion elsewhere <\s>
<s> if the opinion were once generally established among the laboring class that their welfare required a due regulation of the numbers of families the respectable and well conducted of the body would conform to the prescription and only those would exempt themselves from it who were in the habit of making light of social obligations generally and there would be then an evident justification for converting the moral obligation against bringing children into the world who are a burden to the community into a legal one just as in many other cases of the progress of opinion the law ends by enforcing against recalcitrant minorities obligations which to be useful must be general and which from a sense of their utility a large majority have voluntarily consented to take upon themselves <\s>
<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>
<s> it is familiar to all trades unions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices <\s>
<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>

<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>

<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>
<s> it is familiar to all trades unions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices <\s>
<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>

<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>
<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from different degrees of attractiveness in different employments <\s>
<s> in treating of wages we have hitherto confined ourselves to the causes which operate on them generally and en masse the laws which govern the remuneration of ordinary or average labor without reference to the existence of different kinds of work which are habitually paid at different rates depending in some degree on different laws <\s>
<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>

<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>
<s> if the chances are great of total failure the reward in case of success must be sufficient to make up in the general estimation for those adverse chances <\s>

<s> the soil was ill cultivated by pauper labor and its rental consumed by parish rates <\s>
<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>
<s> it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages <\s>
<s> there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live <\s>
<s> we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week <\s>
<s> shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten <\s>
<s> but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication <\s>
<s> their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay <\s>
<s> receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings <\s>
<s> they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once <\s>
<s> it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before <\s>
<s> the operation of a low standard upon the wages of those in the community who have a higher one has been seen in the united states to a certain extent by the landing on our shores of chinese laborers who maintain a decidedly lower standard of living than either their american or irish competitors <\s>
<s> if they come in such numbers as to retain their lower standard by forming a group by themselves and are thereby not assimilated into the body of laborers who have a higher standard of comfort they can to the extent of their ability to do work drive other laborers out of employment <\s>
<s> this moreover is exactly what was done by the irish who drove americans out of the mills of new england and who are now being driven out probably by the french canadians with a standard lower than the irish <\s>

<s> it will be noted how many come in the prime of life and how few children and females there are <\s>
<s> it need hardly be said that the economic side of a question is here discussed which requires for its solution many ethical and political considerations besides <\s>
<s> grounds for expecting improvement in public opinion on the subject of population <\s>
<s> by what means then is poverty to be contended against <\s>
<s> how is the evil of low wages to be remedied <\s>
<s> if the expedients usually recommended for the purpose are not adapted to it can no others be thought of <\s>
<s> is the problem incapable of solution <\s>
<s> can political economy do nothing but only object to everything and demonstrate that nothing can be done <\s>
<s> those who think it hopeless that the laboring classes should be induced to practice a sufficient degree of prudence in regard to the increase of their families because they have hitherto stopped short of that point show an inability to estimate the ordinary principles of human action <\s>
<s> nothing more would probably be necessary to secure that result than an opinion generally diffused that it was desirable <\s>
<s> but let us try to imagine what would happen if the idea became general among the laboring class that the competition of too great numbers was the principal cause of their poverty <\s>
<s> we are often told that the most thorough perception of the dependence of wages on population will not influence the conduct of a laboring man because it is not the children he himself can have that will produce any effect in generally depressing the labor market <\s>

<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>
<s> it is familiar to all trades unions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices <\s>
<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>

<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>
<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from different degrees of attractiveness in different employments <\s>
<s> in treating of wages we have hitherto confined ourselves to the causes which operate on them generally and en masse the laws which govern the remuneration of ordinary or average labor without reference to the existence of different kinds of work which are habitually paid at different rates depending in some degree on different laws <\s>
<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>
<s> honor makes a great part of the reward of all honorable professions <\s>
<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>
<s> if the chances are great of total failure the reward in case of success must be sufficient to make up in the general estimation for those adverse chances <\s>
<s> put your son apprentice to a shoemaker there is little doubt of his learning to make a pair of shoes but send him to study the law it is at least twenty to one if ever he makes such proficiency as will enable him to live by the business <\s>

<s> 4    the wages of labor vary according to the small or great trust which must be reposed in the workmen <\s>
<s> the soil was ill cultivated by pauper labor and its rental consumed by parish rates <\s>
<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>
<s> it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages <\s>
<s> there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live <\s>
<s> we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week <\s>
<s> shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten <\s>
<s> but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication <\s>
<s> their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay <\s>
<s> receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings <\s>
<s> they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once <\s>
<s> it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before <\s>
<s> the operation of a low standard upon the wages of those in the community who have a higher one has been seen in the united states to a certain extent by the landing on our shores of chinese laborers who maintain a decidedly lower standard of living than either their american or irish competitors <\s>
<s> if they come in such numbers as to retain their lower standard by forming a group by themselves and are thereby not assimilated into the body of laborers who have a higher standard of comfort they can to the extent of their ability to do work drive other laborers out of employment <\s>
<s> this moreover is exactly what was done by the irish who drove americans out of the mills of new england and who are now being driven out probably by the french canadians with a standard lower than the irish <\s>

<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>
<s> it is familiar to all trades unions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices <\s>

<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>
<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from different degrees of attractiveness in different employments <\s>
<s> in treating of wages we have hitherto confined ourselves to the causes which operate on them generally and en masse the laws which govern the remuneration of ordinary or average labor without reference to the existence of different kinds of work which are habitually paid at different rates depending in some degree on different laws <\s>
<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>
<s> honor makes a great part of the reward of all honorable professions <\s>
<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>
<s> if the chances are great of total failure the reward in case of success must be sufficient to make up in the general estimation for those adverse chances <\s>

<s> 4    the wages of labor vary according to the small or great trust which must be reposed in the workmen <\s>
<s> the soil was ill cultivated by pauper labor and its rental consumed by parish rates <\s>
<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>
<s> it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages <\s>
<s> there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live <\s>
<s> we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week <\s>
<s> shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten <\s>
<s> but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication <\s>
<s> their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay <\s>
<s> receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings <\s>
<s> they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once <\s>
<s> it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before <\s>

<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>
<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from different degrees of attractiveness in different employments <\s>
<s> in treating of wages we have hitherto confined ourselves to the causes which operate on them generally and en masse the laws which govern the remuneration of ordinary or average labor without reference to the existence of different kinds of work which are habitually paid at different rates depending in some degree on different laws <\s>
<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>

<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>
<s> if the chances are great of total failure the reward in case of success must be sufficient to make up in the general estimation for those adverse chances <\s>

<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>

<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>

<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>

<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>
<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from different degrees of attractiveness in different employments <\s>
<s> in treating of wages we have hitherto confined ourselves to the causes which operate on them generally and en masse the laws which govern the remuneration of ordinary or average labor without reference to the existence of different kinds of work which are habitually paid at different rates depending in some degree on different laws <\s>
<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>
<s> honor makes a great part of the reward of all honorable professions <\s>
<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>
<s> if the chances are great of total failure the reward in case of success must be sufficient to make up in the general estimation for those adverse chances <\s>

<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>
<s> it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages <\s>
<s> there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live <\s>
<s> we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week <\s>
<s> shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten <\s>
<s> but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication <\s>
<s> their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay <\s>
<s> receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings <\s>
<s> they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once <\s>
<s> it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before <\s>
<s> the operation of a low standard upon the wages of those in the community who have a higher one has been seen in the united states to a certain extent by the landing on our shores of chinese laborers who maintain a decidedly lower standard of living than either their american or irish competitors <\s>
<s> if they come in such numbers as to retain their lower standard by forming a group by themselves and are thereby not assimilated into the body of laborers who have a higher standard of comfort they can to the extent of their ability to do work drive other laborers out of employment <\s>

<s> but let us try to imagine what would happen if the idea became general among the laboring class that the competition of too great numbers was the principal cause of their poverty <\s>
<s> we are often told that the most thorough perception of the dependence of wages on population will not influence the conduct of a laboring man because it is not the children he himself can have that will produce any effect in generally depressing the labor market <\s>
<s> true and it is also true that one soldiers running away will not lose the battle accordingly it is not that consideration which keeps each soldier in his rank it is the disgrace which naturally and inevitably attends on conduct by any one individual which if pursued by a majority everybody can see would be fatal <\s>
<s> men are seldom found to brave the general opinion of their class unless supported either by some principle higher than regard for opinion or by some strong body of opinion elsewhere <\s>
<s> if the opinion were once generally established among the laboring class that their welfare required a due regulation of the numbers of families the respectable and well conducted of the body would conform to the prescription and only those would exempt themselves from it who were in the habit of making light of social obligations generally and there would be then an evident justification for converting the moral obligation against bringing children into the world who are a burden to the community into a legal one just as in many other cases of the progress of opinion the law ends by enforcing against recalcitrant minorities obligations which to be useful must be general and which from a sense of their utility a large majority have voluntarily consented to take upon themselves <\s>
<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>
<s> it is familiar to all trades unions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices <\s>
<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>
<s> the principle is understood in its application to any one employment but not to the general mass of employment <\s>
<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>
<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from different degrees of attractiveness in different employments <\s>
<s> in treating of wages we have hitherto confined ourselves to the causes which operate on them generally and en masse the laws which govern the remuneration of ordinary or average labor without reference to the existence of different kinds of work which are habitually paid at different rates depending in some degree on different laws <\s>
<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>
<s> honor makes a great part of the reward of all honorable professions <\s>
<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>
<s> if the chances are great of total failure the reward in case of success must be sufficient to make up in the general estimation for those adverse chances <\s>

<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>

<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>

<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>
<s> the principle is understood in its application to any one employment but not to the general mass of employment <\s>
<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>
<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>

<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>

<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>

<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>

<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>
<s> honor makes a great part of the reward of all honorable professions <\s>
<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>
<s> if the chances are great of total failure the reward in case of success must be sufficient to make up in the general estimation for those adverse chances <\s>

<s> the soil was ill cultivated by pauper labor and its rental consumed by parish rates <\s>
<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>
<s> it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages <\s>
<s> there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live <\s>
<s> we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week <\s>
<s> shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten <\s>
<s> but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication <\s>
<s> their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay <\s>
<s> receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings <\s>
<s> they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once <\s>
<s> it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before <\s>
<s> the operation of a low standard upon the wages of those in the community who have a higher one has been seen in the united states to a certain extent by the landing on our shores of chinese laborers who maintain a decidedly lower standard of living than either their american or irish competitors <\s>
<s> if they come in such numbers as to retain their lower standard by forming a group by themselves and are thereby not assimilated into the body of laborers who have a higher standard of comfort they can to the extent of their ability to do work drive other laborers out of employment <\s>
<s> this moreover is exactly what was done by the irish who drove americans out of the mills of new england and who are now being driven out probably by the french canadians with a standard lower than the irish <\s>

<s> it will be noted how many come in the prime of life and how few children and females there are <\s>
<s> it need hardly be said that the economic side of a question is here discussed which requires for its solution many ethical and political considerations besides <\s>
<s> grounds for expecting improvement in public opinion on the subject of population <\s>
<s> by what means then is poverty to be contended against <\s>
<s> how is the evil of low wages to be remedied <\s>
<s> if the expedients usually recommended for the purpose are not adapted to it can no others be thought of <\s>
<s> is the problem incapable of solution <\s>
<s> can political economy do nothing but only object to everything and demonstrate that nothing can be done <\s>
<s> those who think it hopeless that the laboring classes should be induced to practice a sufficient degree of prudence in regard to the increase of their families because they have hitherto stopped short of that point show an inability to estimate the ordinary principles of human action <\s>
<s> nothing more would probably be necessary to secure that result than an opinion generally diffused that it was desirable <\s>
<s> but let us try to imagine what would happen if the idea became general among the laboring class that the competition of too great numbers was the principal cause of their poverty <\s>
<s> we are often told that the most thorough perception of the dependence of wages on population will not influence the conduct of a laboring man because it is not the children he himself can have that will produce any effect in generally depressing the labor market <\s>
<s> true and it is also true that one soldiers running away will not lose the battle accordingly it is not that consideration which keeps each soldier in his rank it is the disgrace which naturally and inevitably attends on conduct by any one individual which if pursued by a majority everybody can see would be fatal <\s>
<s> men are seldom found to brave the general opinion of their class unless supported either by some principle higher than regard for opinion or by some strong body of opinion elsewhere <\s>
<s> if the opinion were once generally established among the laboring class that their welfare required a due regulation of the numbers of families the respectable and well conducted of the body would conform to the prescription and only those would exempt themselves from it who were in the habit of making light of social obligations generally and there would be then an evident justification for converting the moral obligation against bringing children into the world who are a burden to the community into a legal one just as in many other cases of the progress of opinion the law ends by enforcing against recalcitrant minorities obligations which to be useful must be general and which from a sense of their utility a large majority have voluntarily consented to take upon themselves <\s>
<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>
<s> it is familiar to all trades unions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices <\s>
<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>
<s> the principle is understood in its application to any one employment but not to the general mass of employment <\s>
<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>

<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>

<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>

<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>

<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>
<s> it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages <\s>
<s> there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live <\s>
<s> we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week <\s>
<s> shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten <\s>
<s> but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication <\s>
<s> their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay <\s>
<s> receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings <\s>
<s> they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once <\s>
<s> it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before <\s>
<s> the operation of a low standard upon the wages of those in the community who have a higher one has been seen in the united states to a certain extent by the landing on our shores of chinese laborers who maintain a decidedly lower standard of living than either their american or irish competitors <\s>
<s> if they come in such numbers as to retain their lower standard by forming a group by themselves and are thereby not assimilated into the body of laborers who have a higher standard of comfort they can to the extent of their ability to do work drive other laborers out of employment <\s>
<s> this moreover is exactly what was done by the irish who drove americans out of the mills of new england and who are now being driven out probably by the french canadians with a standard lower than the irish <\s>

<s> by what means then is poverty to be contended against <\s>
<s> how is the evil of low wages to be remedied <\s>
<s> if the expedients usually recommended for the purpose are not adapted to it can no others be thought of <\s>
<s> is the problem incapable of solution <\s>
<s> can political economy do nothing but only object to everything and demonstrate that nothing can be done <\s>
<s> those who think it hopeless that the laboring classes should be induced to practice a sufficient degree of prudence in regard to the increase of their families because they have hitherto stopped short of that point show an inability to estimate the ordinary principles of human action <\s>
<s> nothing more would probably be necessary to secure that result than an opinion generally diffused that it was desirable <\s>
<s> but let us try to imagine what would happen if the idea became general among the laboring class that the competition of too great numbers was the principal cause of their poverty <\s>
<s> we are often told that the most thorough perception of the dependence of wages on population will not influence the conduct of a laboring man because it is not the children he himself can have that will produce any effect in generally depressing the labor market <\s>
<s> true and it is also true that one soldiers running away will not lose the battle accordingly it is not that consideration which keeps each soldier in his rank it is the disgrace which naturally and inevitably attends on conduct by any one individual which if pursued by a majority everybody can see would be fatal <\s>
<s> men are seldom found to brave the general opinion of their class unless supported either by some principle higher than regard for opinion or by some strong body of opinion elsewhere <\s>
<s> if the opinion were once generally established among the laboring class that their welfare required a due regulation of the numbers of families the respectable and well conducted of the body would conform to the prescription and only those would exempt themselves from it who were in the habit of making light of social obligations generally and there would be then an evident justification for converting the moral obligation against bringing children into the world who are a burden to the community into a legal one just as in many other cases of the progress of opinion the law ends by enforcing against recalcitrant minorities obligations which to be useful must be general and which from a sense of their utility a large majority have voluntarily consented to take upon themselves <\s>
<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>
<s> it is familiar to all trades unions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices <\s>
<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>
<s> the principle is understood in its application to any one employment but not to the general mass of employment <\s>
<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>

<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>

<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from different degrees of attractiveness in different employments <\s>
<s> in treating of wages we have hitherto confined ourselves to the causes which operate on them generally and en masse the laws which govern the remuneration of ordinary or average labor without reference to the existence of different kinds of work which are habitually paid at different rates depending in some degree on different laws <\s>
<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>
<s> honor makes a great part of the reward of all honorable professions <\s>
<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>

<s> 4    the wages of labor vary according to the small or great trust which must be reposed in the workmen <\s>
<s> the soil was ill cultivated by pauper labor and its rental consumed by parish rates <\s>
<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>
<s> it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages <\s>
<s> there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live <\s>
<s> we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week <\s>
<s> shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten <\s>
<s> but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication <\s>
<s> their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay <\s>
<s> receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings <\s>
<s> they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once <\s>
<s> it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before <\s>
<s> the operation of a low standard upon the wages of those in the community who have a higher one has been seen in the united states to a certain extent by the landing on our shores of chinese laborers who maintain a decidedly lower standard of living than either their american or irish competitors <\s>
<s> if they come in such numbers as to retain their lower standard by forming a group by themselves and are thereby not assimilated into the body of laborers who have a higher standard of comfort they can to the extent of their ability to do work drive other laborers out of employment <\s>
<s> this moreover is exactly what was done by the irish who drove americans out of the mills of new england and who are now being driven out probably by the french canadians with a standard lower than the irish <\s>

<s> it will be noted how many come in the prime of life and how few children and females there are <\s>
<s> it need hardly be said that the economic side of a question is here discussed which requires for its solution many ethical and political considerations besides <\s>
<s> grounds for expecting improvement in public opinion on the subject of population <\s>
<s> by what means then is poverty to be contended against <\s>
<s> how is the evil of low wages to be remedied <\s>
<s> if the expedients usually recommended for the purpose are not adapted to it can no others be thought of <\s>
<s> is the problem incapable of solution <\s>
<s> can political economy do nothing but only object to everything and demonstrate that nothing can be done <\s>
<s> those who think it hopeless that the laboring classes should be induced to practice a sufficient degree of prudence in regard to the increase of their families because they have hitherto stopped short of that point show an inability to estimate the ordinary principles of human action <\s>
<s> nothing more would probably be necessary to secure that result than an opinion generally diffused that it was desirable <\s>
<s> but let us try to imagine what would happen if the idea became general among the laboring class that the competition of too great numbers was the principal cause of their poverty <\s>
<s> we are often told that the most thorough perception of the dependence of wages on population will not influence the conduct of a laboring man because it is not the children he himself can have that will produce any effect in generally depressing the labor market <\s>
<s> true and it is also true that one soldiers running away will not lose the battle accordingly it is not that consideration which keeps each soldier in his rank it is the disgrace which naturally and inevitably attends on conduct by any one individual which if pursued by a majority everybody can see would be fatal <\s>
<s> men are seldom found to brave the general opinion of their class unless supported either by some principle higher than regard for opinion or by some strong body of opinion elsewhere <\s>
<s> if the opinion were once generally established among the laboring class that their welfare required a due regulation of the numbers of families the respectable and well conducted of the body would conform to the prescription and only those would exempt themselves from it who were in the habit of making light of social obligations generally and there would be then an evident justification for converting the moral obligation against bringing children into the world who are a burden to the community into a legal one just as in many other cases of the progress of opinion the law ends by enforcing against recalcitrant minorities obligations which to be useful must be general and which from a sense of their utility a large majority have voluntarily consented to take upon themselves <\s>
<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>
<s> it is familiar to all trades unions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices <\s>
<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>
<s> the principle is understood in its application to any one employment but not to the general mass of employment <\s>
<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>

<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>
<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from different degrees of attractiveness in different employments <\s>
<s> in treating of wages we have hitherto confined ourselves to the causes which operate on them generally and en masse the laws which govern the remuneration of ordinary or average labor without reference to the existence of different kinds of work which are habitually paid at different rates depending in some degree on different laws <\s>
<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>
<s> honor makes a great part of the reward of all honorable professions <\s>
<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>
<s> if the chances are great of total failure the reward in case of success must be sufficient to make up in the general estimation for those adverse chances <\s>
<s> put your son apprentice to a shoemaker there is little doubt of his learning to make a pair of shoes but send him to study the law it is at least twenty to one if ever he makes such proficiency as will enable him to live by the business <\s>

<s> 4    the wages of labor vary according to the small or great trust which must be reposed in the workmen <\s>
<s> the soil was ill cultivated by pauper labor and its rental consumed by parish rates <\s>
<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>
<s> it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages <\s>
<s> there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live <\s>
<s> we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week <\s>
<s> shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten <\s>
<s> but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication <\s>
<s> their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay <\s>
<s> receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings <\s>
<s> they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once <\s>
<s> it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before <\s>
<s> the operation of a low standard upon the wages of those in the community who have a higher one has been seen in the united states to a certain extent by the landing on our shores of chinese laborers who maintain a decidedly lower standard of living than either their american or irish competitors <\s>
<s> if they come in such numbers as to retain their lower standard by forming a group by themselves and are thereby not assimilated into the body of laborers who have a higher standard of comfort they can to the extent of their ability to do work drive other laborers out of employment <\s>
<s> this moreover is exactly what was done by the irish who drove americans out of the mills of new england and who are now being driven out probably by the french canadians with a standard lower than the irish <\s>
<s> the chinese come here now without their families as may be seen by the accompanying diagram in which the shaded side represents the males on the left and the unshaded the females on the right of the perpendicular line <\s>

<s> it will be noted how many come in the prime of life and how few children and females there are <\s>
<s> it need hardly be said that the economic side of a question is here discussed which requires for its solution many ethical and political considerations besides <\s>
<s> grounds for expecting improvement in public opinion on the subject of population <\s>
<s> by what means then is poverty to be contended against <\s>
<s> how is the evil of low wages to be remedied <\s>
<s> if the expedients usually recommended for the purpose are not adapted to it can no others be thought of <\s>
<s> is the problem incapable of solution <\s>
<s> can political economy do nothing but only object to everything and demonstrate that nothing can be done <\s>
<s> those who think it hopeless that the laboring classes should be induced to practice a sufficient degree of prudence in regard to the increase of their families because they have hitherto stopped short of that point show an inability to estimate the ordinary principles of human action <\s>
<s> nothing more would probably be necessary to secure that result than an opinion generally diffused that it was desirable <\s>
<s> but let us try to imagine what would happen if the idea became general among the laboring class that the competition of too great numbers was the principal cause of their poverty <\s>
<s> we are often told that the most thorough perception of the dependence of wages on population will not influence the conduct of a laboring man because it is not the children he himself can have that will produce any effect in generally depressing the labor market <\s>
<s> true and it is also true that one soldiers running away will not lose the battle accordingly it is not that consideration which keeps each soldier in his rank it is the disgrace which naturally and inevitably attends on conduct by any one individual which if pursued by a majority everybody can see would be fatal <\s>
<s> men are seldom found to brave the general opinion of their class unless supported either by some principle higher than regard for opinion or by some strong body of opinion elsewhere <\s>
<s> if the opinion were once generally established among the laboring class that their welfare required a due regulation of the numbers of families the respectable and well conducted of the body would conform to the prescription and only those would exempt themselves from it who were in the habit of making light of social obligations generally and there would be then an evident justification for converting the moral obligation against bringing children into the world who are a burden to the community into a legal one just as in many other cases of the progress of opinion the law ends by enforcing against recalcitrant minorities obligations which to be useful must be general and which from a sense of their utility a large majority have voluntarily consented to take upon themselves <\s>
<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>
<s> it is familiar to all trades unions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices <\s>
<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>

<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>

<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>
<s> it is familiar to all trades unions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices <\s>
<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>

<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>
<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from different degrees of attractiveness in different employments <\s>
<s> in treating of wages we have hitherto confined ourselves to the causes which operate on them generally and en masse the laws which govern the remuneration of ordinary or average labor without reference to the existence of different kinds of work which are habitually paid at different rates depending in some degree on different laws <\s>
<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>

<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>
<s> if the chances are great of total failure the reward in case of success must be sufficient to make up in the general estimation for those adverse chances <\s>

<s> the soil was ill cultivated by pauper labor and its rental consumed by parish rates <\s>
<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>
<s> it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages <\s>
<s> there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live <\s>
<s> we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week <\s>
<s> shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten <\s>
<s> but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication <\s>
<s> their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay <\s>
<s> receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings <\s>
<s> they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once <\s>
<s> it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before <\s>
<s> the operation of a low standard upon the wages of those in the community who have a higher one has been seen in the united states to a certain extent by the landing on our shores of chinese laborers who maintain a decidedly lower standard of living than either their american or irish competitors <\s>
<s> if they come in such numbers as to retain their lower standard by forming a group by themselves and are thereby not assimilated into the body of laborers who have a higher standard of comfort they can to the extent of their ability to do work drive other laborers out of employment <\s>
<s> this moreover is exactly what was done by the irish who drove americans out of the mills of new england and who are now being driven out probably by the french canadians with a standard lower than the irish <\s>

<s> it will be noted how many come in the prime of life and how few children and females there are <\s>
<s> it need hardly be said that the economic side of a question is here discussed which requires for its solution many ethical and political considerations besides <\s>
<s> grounds for expecting improvement in public opinion on the subject of population <\s>
<s> by what means then is poverty to be contended against <\s>
<s> how is the evil of low wages to be remedied <\s>
<s> if the expedients usually recommended for the purpose are not adapted to it can no others be thought of <\s>
<s> is the problem incapable of solution <\s>
<s> can political economy do nothing but only object to everything and demonstrate that nothing can be done <\s>
<s> those who think it hopeless that the laboring classes should be induced to practice a sufficient degree of prudence in regard to the increase of their families because they have hitherto stopped short of that point show an inability to estimate the ordinary principles of human action <\s>
<s> nothing more would probably be necessary to secure that result than an opinion generally diffused that it was desirable <\s>
<s> but let us try to imagine what would happen if the idea became general among the laboring class that the competition of too great numbers was the principal cause of their poverty <\s>
<s> we are often told that the most thorough perception of the dependence of wages on population will not influence the conduct of a laboring man because it is not the children he himself can have that will produce any effect in generally depressing the labor market <\s>

<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>
<s> it is familiar to all trades unions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices <\s>
<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>

<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>
<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from different degrees of attractiveness in different employments <\s>
<s> in treating of wages we have hitherto confined ourselves to the causes which operate on them generally and en masse the laws which govern the remuneration of ordinary or average labor without reference to the existence of different kinds of work which are habitually paid at different rates depending in some degree on different laws <\s>
<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>
<s> honor makes a great part of the reward of all honorable professions <\s>
<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>
<s> if the chances are great of total failure the reward in case of success must be sufficient to make up in the general estimation for those adverse chances <\s>
<s> put your son apprentice to a shoemaker there is little doubt of his learning to make a pair of shoes but send him to study the law it is at least twenty to one if ever he makes such proficiency as will enable him to live by the business <\s>

<s> 4    the wages of labor vary according to the small or great trust which must be reposed in the workmen <\s>
<s> the soil was ill cultivated by pauper labor and its rental consumed by parish rates <\s>
<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>
<s> it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages <\s>
<s> there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live <\s>
<s> we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week <\s>
<s> shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten <\s>
<s> but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication <\s>
<s> their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay <\s>
<s> receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings <\s>
<s> they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once <\s>
<s> it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before <\s>
<s> the operation of a low standard upon the wages of those in the community who have a higher one has been seen in the united states to a certain extent by the landing on our shores of chinese laborers who maintain a decidedly lower standard of living than either their american or irish competitors <\s>
<s> if they come in such numbers as to retain their lower standard by forming a group by themselves and are thereby not assimilated into the body of laborers who have a higher standard of comfort they can to the extent of their ability to do work drive other laborers out of employment <\s>
<s> this moreover is exactly what was done by the irish who drove americans out of the mills of new england and who are now being driven out probably by the french canadians with a standard lower than the irish <\s>

<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>
<s> it is familiar to all trades unions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices <\s>

<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>
<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from different degrees of attractiveness in different employments <\s>
<s> in treating of wages we have hitherto confined ourselves to the causes which operate on them generally and en masse the laws which govern the remuneration of ordinary or average labor without reference to the existence of different kinds of work which are habitually paid at different rates depending in some degree on different laws <\s>
<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>
<s> honor makes a great part of the reward of all honorable professions <\s>
<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>
<s> if the chances are great of total failure the reward in case of success must be sufficient to make up in the general estimation for those adverse chances <\s>

<s> 4    the wages of labor vary according to the small or great trust which must be reposed in the workmen <\s>
<s> the soil was ill cultivated by pauper labor and its rental consumed by parish rates <\s>
<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>
<s> it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages <\s>
<s> there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live <\s>
<s> we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week <\s>
<s> shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten <\s>
<s> but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication <\s>
<s> their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay <\s>
<s> receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings <\s>
<s> they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once <\s>
<s> it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before <\s>

<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>
<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from different degrees of attractiveness in different employments <\s>
<s> in treating of wages we have hitherto confined ourselves to the causes which operate on them generally and en masse the laws which govern the remuneration of ordinary or average labor without reference to the existence of different kinds of work which are habitually paid at different rates depending in some degree on different laws <\s>
<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>

<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>
<s> if the chances are great of total failure the reward in case of success must be sufficient to make up in the general estimation for those adverse chances <\s>

<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>

<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>

<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>

<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>
<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from different degrees of attractiveness in different employments <\s>
<s> in treating of wages we have hitherto confined ourselves to the causes which operate on them generally and en masse the laws which govern the remuneration of ordinary or average labor without reference to the existence of different kinds of work which are habitually paid at different rates depending in some degree on different laws <\s>
<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>
<s> honor makes a great part of the reward of all honorable professions <\s>
<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>
<s> if the chances are great of total failure the reward in case of success must be sufficient to make up in the general estimation for those adverse chances <\s>

<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>
<s> it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages <\s>
<s> there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live <\s>
<s> we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week <\s>
<s> shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten <\s>
<s> but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication <\s>
<s> their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay <\s>
<s> receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings <\s>
<s> they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once <\s>
<s> it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before <\s>
<s> the operation of a low standard upon the wages of those in the community who have a higher one has been seen in the united states to a certain extent by the landing on our shores of chinese laborers who maintain a decidedly lower standard of living than either their american or irish competitors <\s>
<s> if they come in such numbers as to retain their lower standard by forming a group by themselves and are thereby not assimilated into the body of laborers who have a higher standard of comfort they can to the extent of their ability to do work drive other laborers out of employment <\s>

<s> but let us try to imagine what would happen if the idea became general among the laboring class that the competition of too great numbers was the principal cause of their poverty <\s>
<s> we are often told that the most thorough perception of the dependence of wages on population will not influence the conduct of a laboring man because it is not the children he himself can have that will produce any effect in generally depressing the labor market <\s>
<s> true and it is also true that one soldiers running away will not lose the battle accordingly it is not that consideration which keeps each soldier in his rank it is the disgrace which naturally and inevitably attends on conduct by any one individual which if pursued by a majority everybody can see would be fatal <\s>
<s> men are seldom found to brave the general opinion of their class unless supported either by some principle higher than regard for opinion or by some strong body of opinion elsewhere <\s>
<s> if the opinion were once generally established among the laboring class that their welfare required a due regulation of the numbers of families the respectable and well conducted of the body would conform to the prescription and only those would exempt themselves from it who were in the habit of making light of social obligations generally and there would be then an evident justification for converting the moral obligation against bringing children into the world who are a burden to the community into a legal one just as in many other cases of the progress of opinion the law ends by enforcing against recalcitrant minorities obligations which to be useful must be general and which from a sense of their utility a large majority have voluntarily consented to take upon themselves <\s>
<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>
<s> it is familiar to all trades unions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices <\s>
<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>
<s> the principle is understood in its application to any one employment but not to the general mass of employment <\s>
<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>
<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from different degrees of attractiveness in different employments <\s>
<s> in treating of wages we have hitherto confined ourselves to the causes which operate on them generally and en masse the laws which govern the remuneration of ordinary or average labor without reference to the existence of different kinds of work which are habitually paid at different rates depending in some degree on different laws <\s>
<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>
<s> honor makes a great part of the reward of all honorable professions <\s>
<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>
<s> if the chances are great of total failure the reward in case of success must be sufficient to make up in the general estimation for those adverse chances <\s>

<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>

<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>

<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>
<s> the principle is understood in its application to any one employment but not to the general mass of employment <\s>
<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>
<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>

<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>

<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>

<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>

<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>
<s> honor makes a great part of the reward of all honorable professions <\s>
<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>
<s> if the chances are great of total failure the reward in case of success must be sufficient to make up in the general estimation for those adverse chances <\s>

<s> the soil was ill cultivated by pauper labor and its rental consumed by parish rates <\s>
<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>
<s> it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages <\s>
<s> there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live <\s>
<s> we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week <\s>
<s> shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten <\s>
<s> but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication <\s>
<s> their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay <\s>
<s> receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings <\s>
<s> they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once <\s>
<s> it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before <\s>
<s> the operation of a low standard upon the wages of those in the community who have a higher one has been seen in the united states to a certain extent by the landing on our shores of chinese laborers who maintain a decidedly lower standard of living than either their american or irish competitors <\s>
<s> if they come in such numbers as to retain their lower standard by forming a group by themselves and are thereby not assimilated into the body of laborers who have a higher standard of comfort they can to the extent of their ability to do work drive other laborers out of employment <\s>
<s> this moreover is exactly what was done by the irish who drove americans out of the mills of new england and who are now being driven out probably by the french canadians with a standard lower than the irish <\s>

<s> it will be noted how many come in the prime of life and how few children and females there are <\s>
<s> it need hardly be said that the economic side of a question is here discussed which requires for its solution many ethical and political considerations besides <\s>
<s> grounds for expecting improvement in public opinion on the subject of population <\s>
<s> by what means then is poverty to be contended against <\s>
<s> how is the evil of low wages to be remedied <\s>
<s> if the expedients usually recommended for the purpose are not adapted to it can no others be thought of <\s>
<s> is the problem incapable of solution <\s>
<s> can political economy do nothing but only object to everything and demonstrate that nothing can be done <\s>
<s> those who think it hopeless that the laboring classes should be induced to practice a sufficient degree of prudence in regard to the increase of their families because they have hitherto stopped short of that point show an inability to estimate the ordinary principles of human action <\s>
<s> nothing more would probably be necessary to secure that result than an opinion generally diffused that it was desirable <\s>
<s> but let us try to imagine what would happen if the idea became general among the laboring class that the competition of too great numbers was the principal cause of their poverty <\s>
<s> we are often told that the most thorough perception of the dependence of wages on population will not influence the conduct of a laboring man because it is not the children he himself can have that will produce any effect in generally depressing the labor market <\s>
<s> true and it is also true that one soldiers running away will not lose the battle accordingly it is not that consideration which keeps each soldier in his rank it is the disgrace which naturally and inevitably attends on conduct by any one individual which if pursued by a majority everybody can see would be fatal <\s>
<s> men are seldom found to brave the general opinion of their class unless supported either by some principle higher than regard for opinion or by some strong body of opinion elsewhere <\s>
<s> if the opinion were once generally established among the laboring class that their welfare required a due regulation of the numbers of families the respectable and well conducted of the body would conform to the prescription and only those would exempt themselves from it who were in the habit of making light of social obligations generally and there would be then an evident justification for converting the moral obligation against bringing children into the world who are a burden to the community into a legal one just as in many other cases of the progress of opinion the law ends by enforcing against recalcitrant minorities obligations which to be useful must be general and which from a sense of their utility a large majority have voluntarily consented to take upon themselves <\s>
<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>
<s> it is familiar to all trades unions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices <\s>
<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>
<s> the principle is understood in its application to any one employment but not to the general mass of employment <\s>
<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>

<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>

<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>

<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>

<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>
<s> it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages <\s>
<s> there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live <\s>
<s> we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week <\s>
<s> shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten <\s>
<s> but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication <\s>
<s> their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay <\s>
<s> receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings <\s>
<s> they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once <\s>
<s> it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before <\s>
<s> the operation of a low standard upon the wages of those in the community who have a higher one has been seen in the united states to a certain extent by the landing on our shores of chinese laborers who maintain a decidedly lower standard of living than either their american or irish competitors <\s>
<s> if they come in such numbers as to retain their lower standard by forming a group by themselves and are thereby not assimilated into the body of laborers who have a higher standard of comfort they can to the extent of their ability to do work drive other laborers out of employment <\s>
<s> this moreover is exactly what was done by the irish who drove americans out of the mills of new england and who are now being driven out probably by the french canadians with a standard lower than the irish <\s>

<s> by what means then is poverty to be contended against <\s>
<s> how is the evil of low wages to be remedied <\s>
<s> if the expedients usually recommended for the purpose are not adapted to it can no others be thought of <\s>
<s> is the problem incapable of solution <\s>
<s> can political economy do nothing but only object to everything and demonstrate that nothing can be done <\s>
<s> those who think it hopeless that the laboring classes should be induced to practice a sufficient degree of prudence in regard to the increase of their families because they have hitherto stopped short of that point show an inability to estimate the ordinary principles of human action <\s>
<s> nothing more would probably be necessary to secure that result than an opinion generally diffused that it was desirable <\s>
<s> but let us try to imagine what would happen if the idea became general among the laboring class that the competition of too great numbers was the principal cause of their poverty <\s>
<s> we are often told that the most thorough perception of the dependence of wages on population will not influence the conduct of a laboring man because it is not the children he himself can have that will produce any effect in generally depressing the labor market <\s>
<s> true and it is also true that one soldiers running away will not lose the battle accordingly it is not that consideration which keeps each soldier in his rank it is the disgrace which naturally and inevitably attends on conduct by any one individual which if pursued by a majority everybody can see would be fatal <\s>
<s> men are seldom found to brave the general opinion of their class unless supported either by some principle higher than regard for opinion or by some strong body of opinion elsewhere <\s>
<s> if the opinion were once generally established among the laboring class that their welfare required a due regulation of the numbers of families the respectable and well conducted of the body would conform to the prescription and only those would exempt themselves from it who were in the habit of making light of social obligations generally and there would be then an evident justification for converting the moral obligation against bringing children into the world who are a burden to the community into a legal one just as in many other cases of the progress of opinion the law ends by enforcing against recalcitrant minorities obligations which to be useful must be general and which from a sense of their utility a large majority have voluntarily consented to take upon themselves <\s>
<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>
<s> it is familiar to all trades unions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices <\s>
<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>
<s> the principle is understood in its application to any one employment but not to the general mass of employment <\s>
<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>

<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>

<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from different degrees of attractiveness in different employments <\s>
<s> in treating of wages we have hitherto confined ourselves to the causes which operate on them generally and en masse the laws which govern the remuneration of ordinary or average labor without reference to the existence of different kinds of work which are habitually paid at different rates depending in some degree on different laws <\s>
<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>
<s> honor makes a great part of the reward of all honorable professions <\s>
<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>

<s> 4    the wages of labor vary according to the small or great trust which must be reposed in the workmen <\s>
<s> the soil was ill cultivated by pauper labor and its rental consumed by parish rates <\s>
<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>
<s> it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages <\s>
<s> there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live <\s>
<s> we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week <\s>
<s> shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten <\s>
<s> but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication <\s>
<s> their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay <\s>
<s> receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings <\s>
<s> they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once <\s>
<s> it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before <\s>
<s> the operation of a low standard upon the wages of those in the community who have a higher one has been seen in the united states to a certain extent by the landing on our shores of chinese laborers who maintain a decidedly lower standard of living than either their american or irish competitors <\s>
<s> if they come in such numbers as to retain their lower standard by forming a group by themselves and are thereby not assimilated into the body of laborers who have a higher standard of comfort they can to the extent of their ability to do work drive other laborers out of employment <\s>
<s> this moreover is exactly what was done by the irish who drove americans out of the mills of new england and who are now being driven out probably by the french canadians with a standard lower than the irish <\s>

<s> it will be noted how many come in the prime of life and how few children and females there are <\s>
<s> it need hardly be said that the economic side of a question is here discussed which requires for its solution many ethical and political considerations besides <\s>
<s> grounds for expecting improvement in public opinion on the subject of population <\s>
<s> by what means then is poverty to be contended against <\s>
<s> how is the evil of low wages to be remedied <\s>
<s> if the expedients usually recommended for the purpose are not adapted to it can no others be thought of <\s>
<s> is the problem incapable of solution <\s>
<s> can political economy do nothing but only object to everything and demonstrate that nothing can be done <\s>
<s> those who think it hopeless that the laboring classes should be induced to practice a sufficient degree of prudence in regard to the increase of their families because they have hitherto stopped short of that point show an inability to estimate the ordinary principles of human action <\s>
<s> nothing more would probably be necessary to secure that result than an opinion generally diffused that it was desirable <\s>
<s> but let us try to imagine what would happen if the idea became general among the laboring class that the competition of too great numbers was the principal cause of their poverty <\s>
<s> we are often told that the most thorough perception of the dependence of wages on population will not influence the conduct of a laboring man because it is not the children he himself can have that will produce any effect in generally depressing the labor market <\s>
<s> true and it is also true that one soldiers running away will not lose the battle accordingly it is not that consideration which keeps each soldier in his rank it is the disgrace which naturally and inevitably attends on conduct by any one individual which if pursued by a majority everybody can see would be fatal <\s>
<s> men are seldom found to brave the general opinion of their class unless supported either by some principle higher than regard for opinion or by some strong body of opinion elsewhere <\s>
<s> if the opinion were once generally established among the laboring class that their welfare required a due regulation of the numbers of families the respectable and well conducted of the body would conform to the prescription and only those would exempt themselves from it who were in the habit of making light of social obligations generally and there would be then an evident justification for converting the moral obligation against bringing children into the world who are a burden to the community into a legal one just as in many other cases of the progress of opinion the law ends by enforcing against recalcitrant minorities obligations which to be useful must be general and which from a sense of their utility a large majority have voluntarily consented to take upon themselves <\s>
<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>
<s> it is familiar to all trades unions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices <\s>
<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>
<s> the principle is understood in its application to any one employment but not to the general mass of employment <\s>
<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>

<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>
<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from different degrees of attractiveness in different employments <\s>
<s> in treating of wages we have hitherto confined ourselves to the causes which operate on them generally and en masse the laws which govern the remuneration of ordinary or average labor without reference to the existence of different kinds of work which are habitually paid at different rates depending in some degree on different laws <\s>
<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>
<s> honor makes a great part of the reward of all honorable professions <\s>
<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>
<s> if the chances are great of total failure the reward in case of success must be sufficient to make up in the general estimation for those adverse chances <\s>
<s> put your son apprentice to a shoemaker there is little doubt of his learning to make a pair of shoes but send him to study the law it is at least twenty to one if ever he makes such proficiency as will enable him to live by the business <\s>

<s> 4    the wages of labor vary according to the small or great trust which must be reposed in the workmen <\s>
<s> the soil was ill cultivated by pauper labor and its rental consumed by parish rates <\s>
<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>
<s> it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages <\s>
<s> there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live <\s>
<s> we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week <\s>
<s> shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten <\s>
<s> but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication <\s>
<s> their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay <\s>
<s> receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings <\s>
<s> they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once <\s>
<s> it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before <\s>
<s> the operation of a low standard upon the wages of those in the community who have a higher one has been seen in the united states to a certain extent by the landing on our shores of chinese laborers who maintain a decidedly lower standard of living than either their american or irish competitors <\s>
<s> if they come in such numbers as to retain their lower standard by forming a group by themselves and are thereby not assimilated into the body of laborers who have a higher standard of comfort they can to the extent of their ability to do work drive other laborers out of employment <\s>
<s> this moreover is exactly what was done by the irish who drove americans out of the mills of new england and who are now being driven out probably by the french canadians with a standard lower than the irish <\s>
<s> the chinese come here now without their families as may be seen by the accompanying diagram in which the shaded side represents the males on the left and the unshaded the females on the right of the perpendicular line <\s>

<s> it will be noted how many come in the prime of life and how few children and females there are <\s>
<s> it need hardly be said that the economic side of a question is here discussed which requires for its solution many ethical and political considerations besides <\s>
<s> grounds for expecting improvement in public opinion on the subject of population <\s>
<s> by what means then is poverty to be contended against <\s>
<s> how is the evil of low wages to be remedied <\s>
<s> if the expedients usually recommended for the purpose are not adapted to it can no others be thought of <\s>
<s> is the problem incapable of solution <\s>
<s> can political economy do nothing but only object to everything and demonstrate that nothing can be done <\s>
<s> those who think it hopeless that the laboring classes should be induced to practice a sufficient degree of prudence in regard to the increase of their families because they have hitherto stopped short of that point show an inability to estimate the ordinary principles of human action <\s>
<s> nothing more would probably be necessary to secure that result than an opinion generally diffused that it was desirable <\s>
<s> but let us try to imagine what would happen if the idea became general among the laboring class that the competition of too great numbers was the principal cause of their poverty <\s>
<s> we are often told that the most thorough perception of the dependence of wages on population will not influence the conduct of a laboring man because it is not the children he himself can have that will produce any effect in generally depressing the labor market <\s>
<s> true and it is also true that one soldiers running away will not lose the battle accordingly it is not that consideration which keeps each soldier in his rank it is the disgrace which naturally and inevitably attends on conduct by any one individual which if pursued by a majority everybody can see would be fatal <\s>
<s> men are seldom found to brave the general opinion of their class unless supported either by some principle higher than regard for opinion or by some strong body of opinion elsewhere <\s>
<s> if the opinion were once generally established among the laboring class that their welfare required a due regulation of the numbers of families the respectable and well conducted of the body would conform to the prescription and only those would exempt themselves from it who were in the habit of making light of social obligations generally and there would be then an evident justification for converting the moral obligation against bringing children into the world who are a burden to the community into a legal one just as in many other cases of the progress of opinion the law ends by enforcing against recalcitrant minorities obligations which to be useful must be general and which from a sense of their utility a large majority have voluntarily consented to take upon themselves <\s>
<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>
<s> it is familiar to all trades unions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices <\s>
<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>

<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>

<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>
<s> it is familiar to all trades unions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices <\s>
<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>

<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>
<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from different degrees of attractiveness in different employments <\s>
<s> in treating of wages we have hitherto confined ourselves to the causes which operate on them generally and en masse the laws which govern the remuneration of ordinary or average labor without reference to the existence of different kinds of work which are habitually paid at different rates depending in some degree on different laws <\s>
<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>

<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>
<s> if the chances are great of total failure the reward in case of success must be sufficient to make up in the general estimation for those adverse chances <\s>

<s> the soil was ill cultivated by pauper labor and its rental consumed by parish rates <\s>
<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>
<s> it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages <\s>
<s> there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live <\s>
<s> we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week <\s>
<s> shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten <\s>
<s> but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication <\s>
<s> their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay <\s>
<s> receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings <\s>
<s> they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once <\s>
<s> it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before <\s>
<s> the operation of a low standard upon the wages of those in the community who have a higher one has been seen in the united states to a certain extent by the landing on our shores of chinese laborers who maintain a decidedly lower standard of living than either their american or irish competitors <\s>
<s> if they come in such numbers as to retain their lower standard by forming a group by themselves and are thereby not assimilated into the body of laborers who have a higher standard of comfort they can to the extent of their ability to do work drive other laborers out of employment <\s>
<s> this moreover is exactly what was done by the irish who drove americans out of the mills of new england and who are now being driven out probably by the french canadians with a standard lower than the irish <\s>

<s> it will be noted how many come in the prime of life and how few children and females there are <\s>
<s> it need hardly be said that the economic side of a question is here discussed which requires for its solution many ethical and political considerations besides <\s>
<s> grounds for expecting improvement in public opinion on the subject of population <\s>
<s> by what means then is poverty to be contended against <\s>
<s> how is the evil of low wages to be remedied <\s>
<s> if the expedients usually recommended for the purpose are not adapted to it can no others be thought of <\s>
<s> is the problem incapable of solution <\s>
<s> can political economy do nothing but only object to everything and demonstrate that nothing can be done <\s>
<s> those who think it hopeless that the laboring classes should be induced to practice a sufficient degree of prudence in regard to the increase of their families because they have hitherto stopped short of that point show an inability to estimate the ordinary principles of human action <\s>
<s> nothing more would probably be necessary to secure that result than an opinion generally diffused that it was desirable <\s>
<s> but let us try to imagine what would happen if the idea became general among the laboring class that the competition of too great numbers was the principal cause of their poverty <\s>
<s> we are often told that the most thorough perception of the dependence of wages on population will not influence the conduct of a laboring man because it is not the children he himself can have that will produce any effect in generally depressing the labor market <\s>

<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>
<s> it is familiar to all trades unions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices <\s>
<s> there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration <\s>

<s> for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve <\s>
<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>
<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from different degrees of attractiveness in different employments <\s>
<s> in treating of wages we have hitherto confined ourselves to the causes which operate on them generally and en masse the laws which govern the remuneration of ordinary or average labor without reference to the existence of different kinds of work which are habitually paid at different rates depending in some degree on different laws <\s>
<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>
<s> honor makes a great part of the reward of all honorable professions <\s>
<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>
<s> if the chances are great of total failure the reward in case of success must be sufficient to make up in the general estimation for those adverse chances <\s>
<s> put your son apprentice to a shoemaker there is little doubt of his learning to make a pair of shoes but send him to study the law it is at least twenty to one if ever he makes such proficiency as will enable him to live by the business <\s>

<s> 4    the wages of labor vary according to the small or great trust which must be reposed in the workmen <\s>
<s> the soil was ill cultivated by pauper labor and its rental consumed by parish rates <\s>
<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>
<s> it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages <\s>
<s> there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live <\s>
<s> we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week <\s>
<s> shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten <\s>
<s> but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication <\s>
<s> their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay <\s>
<s> receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings <\s>
<s> they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once <\s>
<s> it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before <\s>
<s> the operation of a low standard upon the wages of those in the community who have a higher one has been seen in the united states to a certain extent by the landing on our shores of chinese laborers who maintain a decidedly lower standard of living than either their american or irish competitors <\s>
<s> if they come in such numbers as to retain their lower standard by forming a group by themselves and are thereby not assimilated into the body of laborers who have a higher standard of comfort they can to the extent of their ability to do work drive other laborers out of employment <\s>
<s> this moreover is exactly what was done by the irish who drove americans out of the mills of new england and who are now being driven out probably by the french canadians with a standard lower than the irish <\s>

<s> the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboring classes that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on <\s>
<s> it is familiar to all trades unions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices <\s>

<s> twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboring people by education and by foreign and home colonization <\s>
<s> for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty <\s>
<s> an effective national education of the children of the laboring class is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation <\s>
<s> without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded <\s>
<s> but education is not compatible with extreme poverty <\s>
<s> it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population <\s>
<s> toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought <\s>
<s> the first is a great national measure of colonization <\s>
<s> i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population <\s>
<s> it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations <\s>
<s> the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors <\s>
<s> what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboring class who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor <\s>
<s> this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants to foster large holdings in the western states and territories 174 the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security <\s>
<s> the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years    purchase <\s>
<s> these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision <\s>
<s> in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and re granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price <\s>
<s> the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation <\s>
<s> it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wagessuch an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers <\s>
<s> of the differences of wages in different employments <\s>
<s> differences of wages arising from different degrees of attractiveness in different employments <\s>
<s> in treating of wages we have hitherto confined ourselves to the causes which operate on them generally and en masse the laws which govern the remuneration of ordinary or average labor without reference to the existence of different kinds of work which are habitually paid at different rates depending in some degree on different laws <\s>
<s> we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established <\s>
<s> the differences says adam smith arise partly    from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others    these circumstances he considers to be    first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them    1    the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment <\s>
<s> a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight <\s>
<s> his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground <\s>
<s> honor makes a great part of the reward of all honorable professions <\s>
<s> in point of pecuniary gain all things considered    their recompense is in his opinion below the average <\s>
<s>    disgrace has the contrary effect <\s>
<s> the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades <\s>
<s> the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever    2    employment is much more constant    continues adam smith    in some trades than in others <\s>
<s> in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work <\s>
<s> a mason or brick layer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers <\s>
<s> he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any <\s>
<s> what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion       when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers <\s>
<s> a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor <\s>
<s> his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work <\s>
<s> his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases <\s>
<s> the coal heavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant <\s>
<s> if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages <\s>
<s> in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london    these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice <\s>
<s> but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments <\s>
<s> the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice <\s>
<s> if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages <\s>
<s> but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse <\s>
<s> partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor <\s>
<s> 3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it <\s>
<s> if the chances are great of total failure the reward in case of success must be sufficient to make up in the general estimation for those adverse chances <\s>
<s> put your son apprentice to a shoemaker there is little doubt of his learning to make a pair of shoes but send him to study the law it is at least twenty to one if ever he makes such proficiency as will enable him to live by the business <\s>

<s> the following are cases of real inequality and arise from a different principle <\s>
<s> 4    the wages of labor vary according to the small or great trust which must be reposed in the workmen <\s>
<s> the soil was ill cultivated by pauper labor and its rental consumed by parish rates <\s>
<s> in a period of fifty years the poor rates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833 the enormous amount of   8,600 000 <\s>
<s> in many parishes they were approaching the annual value of the land itself    173 the old poor laws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all those born required that the giving of aid should be made as disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community <\s>
<s> this is also the general idea of poor relief in the united states <\s>
<s> the cultivation of the principle of self help in each laborer is certainly the right object at which to aim <\s>
<s> in the united states voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the unfortunate but never give money <\s>
<s> this system has been very successful and by basing its operations on the principle of self help has given the best proof of its right to an increasing influence <\s>
<s> allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living <\s>
<s> next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency <\s>
<s> of this nature was the allowance system <\s>
<s> the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child <\s>
<s> it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages <\s>
<s> there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live <\s>
<s> we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week <\s>
<s> shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten <\s>
<s> but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication <\s>
<s> their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay <\s>
<s> receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings <\s>
<s> they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once <\s>
<s> it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before <\s>

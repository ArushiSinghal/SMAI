<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>

<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>

<s> if we are speaking not of the value of money but of its cost that is the quantity of the countrys labor which must be expended to obtain it we must add 5 to these four conditions of cheapness a fifth condition namely    whose productive industry is the most efficient    this last however does not at all affect the value of money estimated in commodities it affects the general abundance and facility with which all things money and commodities together can be obtained 273 the accompanying chart no <\s>

<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>

<s> there is nothing in the peculiar nature or uses of the precious metals which should make them an exception to the general principles of demand <\s>

<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>
<s> the labor of one country may be as a whole much more efficient than that of another all or most of the commodities capable of being produced in both may be produced in one at less absolute cost than in the other which as we have seen will not necessarily prevent the two countries from exchanging commodities <\s>
<s> the things which the more favored country will import from others are of course those in which it is least superior but by importing them it acquires even in those commodities the same advantage which it possesses in the articles it gives in exchange for them <\s>

<s> of these the last alone depends on the efficiency of her labor the first depends on the law of international values that is on the intensity and extensibility of the foreign demand for her commodities compared with her demand for foreign commodities <\s>

<s> we now pass to another essential part of the theory of the subject <\s>
<s> there are two senses in which a country obtains commodities cheaper by foreign trade in the sense of value and in the sense of cost 1 it gets them cheaper in the first sense by their falling in value relatively to other things the same quantity of them exchanging in the country for a smaller quantity than before of the other produce of the country <\s>
<s> to revert to our original figures of the trade with germany in cloth and linen ]: in england all consumers of linen obtained after the trade was opened seventeen or some greater number of yards for the same quantity of all other things for which they before obtained only fifteen <\s>
<s> the degree of cheapness in this sense of the term depends on the laws of international demand so copiously illustrated in the preceding sections <\s>
<s> 2 but in the other sense that of cost a country gets a commodity cheaper when it obtains a greater quantity of the commodity with the same expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>
<s> the labor of one country may be as a whole much more efficient than that of another all or most of the commodities capable of being produced in both may be produced in one at less absolute cost than in the other which as we have seen will not necessarily prevent the two countries from exchanging commodities <\s>
<s> the things which the more favored country will import from others are of course those in which it is least superior but by importing them it acquires even in those commodities the same advantage which it possesses in the articles it gives in exchange for them <\s>
<s> what her imports cost to her is a function of two variables 1 the quantity of her own commodities which she gives for them and 2 the cost of those commodities <\s>
<s> of these the last alone depends on the efficiency of her labor the first depends on the law of international values that is on the intensity and extensibility of the foreign demand for her commodities compared with her demand for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the great productiveness of any industry in our country has thus two results 1 it gives a larger total out of which labor and capital at home can receive greater rewards and 2 the commodities being cheaper in comparison than other commodities not so easily produced furnish the very articles which are most likely to be sent abroad in accordance with the doctrine of comparative cost <\s>
<s> in the united states those things in the production of which labor and capital are most efficient and so earn the largest rewards are precisely the articles entering most largely into our foreign trade <\s>
<s> that is we get foreign articles cheaper precisely because these exports cost us less in labor and capital <\s>
<s> these of course since we inhabit a country whose natural resources are not yet fully worked are largely the products of the extractive industries as may be seen by the following table of the value of goods entering to the greatest extent into our foreign export trade in 1883 raw cotton 247,328 721 breadstuffs 208,040 850 provisions and animals 118,177 555 mineral oils 40,555 492 wood 26,793 708 tobacco 22,095 229 these six classes of commodities are arranged in the order in which they enter into our export trade and are the six which come first and highest in the list <\s>

<s> the degree of progress which we have now made in the theory of foreign trade puts it in our power to supply what was previously deficient in our view of the theory of money and this when completed will in its turn enable us to conclude the subject of foreign trade <\s>

<s> we now pass to another essential part of the theory of the subject <\s>
<s> there are two senses in which a country obtains commodities cheaper by foreign trade in the sense of value and in the sense of cost 1 it gets them cheaper in the first sense by their falling in value relatively to other things the same quantity of them exchanging in the country for a smaller quantity than before of the other produce of the country <\s>
<s> to revert to our original figures of the trade with germany in cloth and linen ]: in england all consumers of linen obtained after the trade was opened seventeen or some greater number of yards for the same quantity of all other things for which they before obtained only fifteen <\s>
<s> the degree of cheapness in this sense of the term depends on the laws of international demand so copiously illustrated in the preceding sections <\s>
<s> 2 but in the other sense that of cost a country gets a commodity cheaper when it obtains a greater quantity of the commodity with the same expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>
<s> the labor of one country may be as a whole much more efficient than that of another all or most of the commodities capable of being produced in both may be produced in one at less absolute cost than in the other which as we have seen will not necessarily prevent the two countries from exchanging commodities <\s>
<s> the things which the more favored country will import from others are of course those in which it is least superior but by importing them it acquires even in those commodities the same advantage which it possesses in the articles it gives in exchange for them <\s>
<s> what her imports cost to her is a function of two variables 1 the quantity of her own commodities which she gives for them and 2 the cost of those commodities <\s>
<s> of these the last alone depends on the efficiency of her labor the first depends on the law of international values that is on the intensity and extensibility of the foreign demand for her commodities compared with her demand for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the great productiveness of any industry in our country has thus two results 1 it gives a larger total out of which labor and capital at home can receive greater rewards and 2 the commodities being cheaper in comparison than other commodities not so easily produced furnish the very articles which are most likely to be sent abroad in accordance with the doctrine of comparative cost <\s>

<s> there are two senses in which a country obtains commodities cheaper by foreign trade in the sense of value and in the sense of cost 1 it gets them cheaper in the first sense by their falling in value relatively to other things the same quantity of them exchanging in the country for a smaller quantity than before of the other produce of the country <\s>

<s> 2 but in the other sense that of cost a country gets a commodity cheaper when it obtains a greater quantity of the commodity with the same expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>
<s> the labor of one country may be as a whole much more efficient than that of another all or most of the commodities capable of being produced in both may be produced in one at less absolute cost than in the other which as we have seen will not necessarily prevent the two countries from exchanging commodities <\s>
<s> the things which the more favored country will import from others are of course those in which it is least superior but by importing them it acquires even in those commodities the same advantage which it possesses in the articles it gives in exchange for them <\s>
<s> what her imports cost to her is a function of two variables 1 the quantity of her own commodities which she gives for them and 2 the cost of those commodities <\s>
<s> of these the last alone depends on the efficiency of her labor the first depends on the law of international values that is on the intensity and extensibility of the foreign demand for her commodities compared with her demand for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the great productiveness of any industry in our country has thus two results 1 it gives a larger total out of which labor and capital at home can receive greater rewards and 2 the commodities being cheaper in comparison than other commodities not so easily produced furnish the very articles which are most likely to be sent abroad in accordance with the doctrine of comparative cost <\s>
<s> in the united states those things in the production of which labor and capital are most efficient and so earn the largest rewards are precisely the articles entering most largely into our foreign trade <\s>

<s>    it may be considered therefore as established that when two countries trade together in two commodities the exchange value of these commodities relatively to each other will adjust itself to the inclinations and circumstances of the consumers on both sides in such manner that the quantities required by each country of the articles which it imports from its neighbor shall be exactly sufficient to pay for one another <\s>

<s> in so far as the productions of any country possess this property the country obtains all foreign commodities at less cost <\s>

<s> a country which desires few foreign productions and only a limited quantity of them while its own commodities are in great request in foreign countries will obtain its limited imports at extremely small cost that is in exchange for the produce of a very small quantity of its labor and capital <\s>
<s> the law which we have now illustrated may be appropriately named the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> it may be concisely stated as follows the produce of a country exchanges for the produce of other countries at such values as are required in order that the whole of her exports may exactly pay for the whole of her imports <\s>
<s> this law of international values is but an extension of the more general law of value which we called the equation of supply and demand 270 we have seen that the value of a commodity always so adjusts itself as to bring the demand to the exact level of the supply <\s>

<s> 2 but in the other sense that of cost a country gets a commodity cheaper when it obtains a greater quantity of the commodity with the same expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>
<s> the labor of one country may be as a whole much more efficient than that of another all or most of the commodities capable of being produced in both may be produced in one at less absolute cost than in the other which as we have seen will not necessarily prevent the two countries from exchanging commodities <\s>
<s> the things which the more favored country will import from others are of course those in which it is least superior but by importing them it acquires even in those commodities the same advantage which it possesses in the articles it gives in exchange for them <\s>
<s> what her imports cost to her is a function of two variables 1 the quantity of her own commodities which she gives for them and 2 the cost of those commodities <\s>
<s> of these the last alone depends on the efficiency of her labor the first depends on the law of international values that is on the intensity and extensibility of the foreign demand for her commodities compared with her demand for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the great productiveness of any industry in our country has thus two results 1 it gives a larger total out of which labor and capital at home can receive greater rewards and 2 the commodities being cheaper in comparison than other commodities not so easily produced furnish the very articles which are most likely to be sent abroad in accordance with the doctrine of comparative cost <\s>

<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>

<s> if we are speaking not of the value of money but of its cost that is the quantity of the countrys labor which must be expended to obtain it we must add 5 to these four conditions of cheapness a fifth condition namely    whose productive industry is the most efficient    this last however does not at all affect the value of money estimated in commodities it affects the general abundance and facility with which all things money and commodities together can be obtained 273 the accompanying chart no <\s>

<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>

<s> there is nothing in the peculiar nature or uses of the precious metals which should make them an exception to the general principles of demand <\s>

<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>
<s> the labor of one country may be as a whole much more efficient than that of another all or most of the commodities capable of being produced in both may be produced in one at less absolute cost than in the other which as we have seen will not necessarily prevent the two countries from exchanging commodities <\s>
<s> the things which the more favored country will import from others are of course those in which it is least superior but by importing them it acquires even in those commodities the same advantage which it possesses in the articles it gives in exchange for them <\s>

<s> of these the last alone depends on the efficiency of her labor the first depends on the law of international values that is on the intensity and extensibility of the foreign demand for her commodities compared with her demand for foreign commodities <\s>

<s> we now pass to another essential part of the theory of the subject <\s>
<s> there are two senses in which a country obtains commodities cheaper by foreign trade in the sense of value and in the sense of cost 1 it gets them cheaper in the first sense by their falling in value relatively to other things the same quantity of them exchanging in the country for a smaller quantity than before of the other produce of the country <\s>
<s> to revert to our original figures of the trade with germany in cloth and linen ]: in england all consumers of linen obtained after the trade was opened seventeen or some greater number of yards for the same quantity of all other things for which they before obtained only fifteen <\s>
<s> the degree of cheapness in this sense of the term depends on the laws of international demand so copiously illustrated in the preceding sections <\s>
<s> 2 but in the other sense that of cost a country gets a commodity cheaper when it obtains a greater quantity of the commodity with the same expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>
<s> the labor of one country may be as a whole much more efficient than that of another all or most of the commodities capable of being produced in both may be produced in one at less absolute cost than in the other which as we have seen will not necessarily prevent the two countries from exchanging commodities <\s>
<s> the things which the more favored country will import from others are of course those in which it is least superior but by importing them it acquires even in those commodities the same advantage which it possesses in the articles it gives in exchange for them <\s>
<s> what her imports cost to her is a function of two variables 1 the quantity of her own commodities which she gives for them and 2 the cost of those commodities <\s>
<s> of these the last alone depends on the efficiency of her labor the first depends on the law of international values that is on the intensity and extensibility of the foreign demand for her commodities compared with her demand for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the great productiveness of any industry in our country has thus two results 1 it gives a larger total out of which labor and capital at home can receive greater rewards and 2 the commodities being cheaper in comparison than other commodities not so easily produced furnish the very articles which are most likely to be sent abroad in accordance with the doctrine of comparative cost <\s>
<s> in the united states those things in the production of which labor and capital are most efficient and so earn the largest rewards are precisely the articles entering most largely into our foreign trade <\s>
<s> that is we get foreign articles cheaper precisely because these exports cost us less in labor and capital <\s>
<s> these of course since we inhabit a country whose natural resources are not yet fully worked are largely the products of the extractive industries as may be seen by the following table of the value of goods entering to the greatest extent into our foreign export trade in 1883 raw cotton 247,328 721 breadstuffs 208,040 850 provisions and animals 118,177 555 mineral oils 40,555 492 wood 26,793 708 tobacco 22,095 229 these six classes of commodities are arranged in the order in which they enter into our export trade and are the six which come first and highest in the list <\s>

<s> the degree of progress which we have now made in the theory of foreign trade puts it in our power to supply what was previously deficient in our view of the theory of money and this when completed will in its turn enable us to conclude the subject of foreign trade <\s>

<s> we now pass to another essential part of the theory of the subject <\s>
<s> there are two senses in which a country obtains commodities cheaper by foreign trade in the sense of value and in the sense of cost 1 it gets them cheaper in the first sense by their falling in value relatively to other things the same quantity of them exchanging in the country for a smaller quantity than before of the other produce of the country <\s>
<s> to revert to our original figures of the trade with germany in cloth and linen ]: in england all consumers of linen obtained after the trade was opened seventeen or some greater number of yards for the same quantity of all other things for which they before obtained only fifteen <\s>
<s> the degree of cheapness in this sense of the term depends on the laws of international demand so copiously illustrated in the preceding sections <\s>
<s> 2 but in the other sense that of cost a country gets a commodity cheaper when it obtains a greater quantity of the commodity with the same expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>
<s> the labor of one country may be as a whole much more efficient than that of another all or most of the commodities capable of being produced in both may be produced in one at less absolute cost than in the other which as we have seen will not necessarily prevent the two countries from exchanging commodities <\s>
<s> the things which the more favored country will import from others are of course those in which it is least superior but by importing them it acquires even in those commodities the same advantage which it possesses in the articles it gives in exchange for them <\s>
<s> what her imports cost to her is a function of two variables 1 the quantity of her own commodities which she gives for them and 2 the cost of those commodities <\s>
<s> of these the last alone depends on the efficiency of her labor the first depends on the law of international values that is on the intensity and extensibility of the foreign demand for her commodities compared with her demand for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the great productiveness of any industry in our country has thus two results 1 it gives a larger total out of which labor and capital at home can receive greater rewards and 2 the commodities being cheaper in comparison than other commodities not so easily produced furnish the very articles which are most likely to be sent abroad in accordance with the doctrine of comparative cost <\s>

<s> there are two senses in which a country obtains commodities cheaper by foreign trade in the sense of value and in the sense of cost 1 it gets them cheaper in the first sense by their falling in value relatively to other things the same quantity of them exchanging in the country for a smaller quantity than before of the other produce of the country <\s>

<s> 2 but in the other sense that of cost a country gets a commodity cheaper when it obtains a greater quantity of the commodity with the same expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>
<s> the labor of one country may be as a whole much more efficient than that of another all or most of the commodities capable of being produced in both may be produced in one at less absolute cost than in the other which as we have seen will not necessarily prevent the two countries from exchanging commodities <\s>
<s> the things which the more favored country will import from others are of course those in which it is least superior but by importing them it acquires even in those commodities the same advantage which it possesses in the articles it gives in exchange for them <\s>
<s> what her imports cost to her is a function of two variables 1 the quantity of her own commodities which she gives for them and 2 the cost of those commodities <\s>
<s> of these the last alone depends on the efficiency of her labor the first depends on the law of international values that is on the intensity and extensibility of the foreign demand for her commodities compared with her demand for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the great productiveness of any industry in our country has thus two results 1 it gives a larger total out of which labor and capital at home can receive greater rewards and 2 the commodities being cheaper in comparison than other commodities not so easily produced furnish the very articles which are most likely to be sent abroad in accordance with the doctrine of comparative cost <\s>
<s> in the united states those things in the production of which labor and capital are most efficient and so earn the largest rewards are precisely the articles entering most largely into our foreign trade <\s>

<s>    it may be considered therefore as established that when two countries trade together in two commodities the exchange value of these commodities relatively to each other will adjust itself to the inclinations and circumstances of the consumers on both sides in such manner that the quantities required by each country of the articles which it imports from its neighbor shall be exactly sufficient to pay for one another <\s>

<s> in so far as the productions of any country possess this property the country obtains all foreign commodities at less cost <\s>

<s> a country which desires few foreign productions and only a limited quantity of them while its own commodities are in great request in foreign countries will obtain its limited imports at extremely small cost that is in exchange for the produce of a very small quantity of its labor and capital <\s>
<s> the law which we have now illustrated may be appropriately named the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> it may be concisely stated as follows the produce of a country exchanges for the produce of other countries at such values as are required in order that the whole of her exports may exactly pay for the whole of her imports <\s>
<s> this law of international values is but an extension of the more general law of value which we called the equation of supply and demand 270 we have seen that the value of a commodity always so adjusts itself as to bring the demand to the exact level of the supply <\s>

<s> 2 but in the other sense that of cost a country gets a commodity cheaper when it obtains a greater quantity of the commodity with the same expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>
<s> the labor of one country may be as a whole much more efficient than that of another all or most of the commodities capable of being produced in both may be produced in one at less absolute cost than in the other which as we have seen will not necessarily prevent the two countries from exchanging commodities <\s>
<s> the things which the more favored country will import from others are of course those in which it is least superior but by importing them it acquires even in those commodities the same advantage which it possesses in the articles it gives in exchange for them <\s>
<s> what her imports cost to her is a function of two variables 1 the quantity of her own commodities which she gives for them and 2 the cost of those commodities <\s>
<s> of these the last alone depends on the efficiency of her labor the first depends on the law of international values that is on the intensity and extensibility of the foreign demand for her commodities compared with her demand for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the great productiveness of any industry in our country has thus two results 1 it gives a larger total out of which labor and capital at home can receive greater rewards and 2 the commodities being cheaper in comparison than other commodities not so easily produced furnish the very articles which are most likely to be sent abroad in accordance with the doctrine of comparative cost <\s>

<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>

<s> if we are speaking not of the value of money but of its cost that is the quantity of the countrys labor which must be expended to obtain it we must add 5 to these four conditions of cheapness a fifth condition namely    whose productive industry is the most efficient    this last however does not at all affect the value of money estimated in commodities it affects the general abundance and facility with which all things money and commodities together can be obtained 273 the accompanying chart no <\s>

<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>

<s> there is nothing in the peculiar nature or uses of the precious metals which should make them an exception to the general principles of demand <\s>

<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>
<s> the labor of one country may be as a whole much more efficient than that of another all or most of the commodities capable of being produced in both may be produced in one at less absolute cost than in the other which as we have seen will not necessarily prevent the two countries from exchanging commodities <\s>
<s> the things which the more favored country will import from others are of course those in which it is least superior but by importing them it acquires even in those commodities the same advantage which it possesses in the articles it gives in exchange for them <\s>

<s> of these the last alone depends on the efficiency of her labor the first depends on the law of international values that is on the intensity and extensibility of the foreign demand for her commodities compared with her demand for foreign commodities <\s>

<s> we now pass to another essential part of the theory of the subject <\s>
<s> there are two senses in which a country obtains commodities cheaper by foreign trade in the sense of value and in the sense of cost 1 it gets them cheaper in the first sense by their falling in value relatively to other things the same quantity of them exchanging in the country for a smaller quantity than before of the other produce of the country <\s>
<s> to revert to our original figures of the trade with germany in cloth and linen ]: in england all consumers of linen obtained after the trade was opened seventeen or some greater number of yards for the same quantity of all other things for which they before obtained only fifteen <\s>
<s> the degree of cheapness in this sense of the term depends on the laws of international demand so copiously illustrated in the preceding sections <\s>
<s> 2 but in the other sense that of cost a country gets a commodity cheaper when it obtains a greater quantity of the commodity with the same expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>
<s> the labor of one country may be as a whole much more efficient than that of another all or most of the commodities capable of being produced in both may be produced in one at less absolute cost than in the other which as we have seen will not necessarily prevent the two countries from exchanging commodities <\s>
<s> the things which the more favored country will import from others are of course those in which it is least superior but by importing them it acquires even in those commodities the same advantage which it possesses in the articles it gives in exchange for them <\s>
<s> what her imports cost to her is a function of two variables 1 the quantity of her own commodities which she gives for them and 2 the cost of those commodities <\s>
<s> of these the last alone depends on the efficiency of her labor the first depends on the law of international values that is on the intensity and extensibility of the foreign demand for her commodities compared with her demand for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the great productiveness of any industry in our country has thus two results 1 it gives a larger total out of which labor and capital at home can receive greater rewards and 2 the commodities being cheaper in comparison than other commodities not so easily produced furnish the very articles which are most likely to be sent abroad in accordance with the doctrine of comparative cost <\s>
<s> in the united states those things in the production of which labor and capital are most efficient and so earn the largest rewards are precisely the articles entering most largely into our foreign trade <\s>
<s> that is we get foreign articles cheaper precisely because these exports cost us less in labor and capital <\s>
<s> these of course since we inhabit a country whose natural resources are not yet fully worked are largely the products of the extractive industries as may be seen by the following table of the value of goods entering to the greatest extent into our foreign export trade in 1883 raw cotton 247,328 721 breadstuffs 208,040 850 provisions and animals 118,177 555 mineral oils 40,555 492 wood 26,793 708 tobacco 22,095 229 these six classes of commodities are arranged in the order in which they enter into our export trade and are the six which come first and highest in the list <\s>

<s> the degree of progress which we have now made in the theory of foreign trade puts it in our power to supply what was previously deficient in our view of the theory of money and this when completed will in its turn enable us to conclude the subject of foreign trade <\s>

<s> we now pass to another essential part of the theory of the subject <\s>
<s> there are two senses in which a country obtains commodities cheaper by foreign trade in the sense of value and in the sense of cost 1 it gets them cheaper in the first sense by their falling in value relatively to other things the same quantity of them exchanging in the country for a smaller quantity than before of the other produce of the country <\s>
<s> to revert to our original figures of the trade with germany in cloth and linen ]: in england all consumers of linen obtained after the trade was opened seventeen or some greater number of yards for the same quantity of all other things for which they before obtained only fifteen <\s>
<s> the degree of cheapness in this sense of the term depends on the laws of international demand so copiously illustrated in the preceding sections <\s>
<s> 2 but in the other sense that of cost a country gets a commodity cheaper when it obtains a greater quantity of the commodity with the same expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>
<s> the labor of one country may be as a whole much more efficient than that of another all or most of the commodities capable of being produced in both may be produced in one at less absolute cost than in the other which as we have seen will not necessarily prevent the two countries from exchanging commodities <\s>
<s> the things which the more favored country will import from others are of course those in which it is least superior but by importing them it acquires even in those commodities the same advantage which it possesses in the articles it gives in exchange for them <\s>
<s> what her imports cost to her is a function of two variables 1 the quantity of her own commodities which she gives for them and 2 the cost of those commodities <\s>
<s> of these the last alone depends on the efficiency of her labor the first depends on the law of international values that is on the intensity and extensibility of the foreign demand for her commodities compared with her demand for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the great productiveness of any industry in our country has thus two results 1 it gives a larger total out of which labor and capital at home can receive greater rewards and 2 the commodities being cheaper in comparison than other commodities not so easily produced furnish the very articles which are most likely to be sent abroad in accordance with the doctrine of comparative cost <\s>

<s> there are two senses in which a country obtains commodities cheaper by foreign trade in the sense of value and in the sense of cost 1 it gets them cheaper in the first sense by their falling in value relatively to other things the same quantity of them exchanging in the country for a smaller quantity than before of the other produce of the country <\s>

<s> 2 but in the other sense that of cost a country gets a commodity cheaper when it obtains a greater quantity of the commodity with the same expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>
<s> the labor of one country may be as a whole much more efficient than that of another all or most of the commodities capable of being produced in both may be produced in one at less absolute cost than in the other which as we have seen will not necessarily prevent the two countries from exchanging commodities <\s>
<s> the things which the more favored country will import from others are of course those in which it is least superior but by importing them it acquires even in those commodities the same advantage which it possesses in the articles it gives in exchange for them <\s>
<s> what her imports cost to her is a function of two variables 1 the quantity of her own commodities which she gives for them and 2 the cost of those commodities <\s>
<s> of these the last alone depends on the efficiency of her labor the first depends on the law of international values that is on the intensity and extensibility of the foreign demand for her commodities compared with her demand for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the great productiveness of any industry in our country has thus two results 1 it gives a larger total out of which labor and capital at home can receive greater rewards and 2 the commodities being cheaper in comparison than other commodities not so easily produced furnish the very articles which are most likely to be sent abroad in accordance with the doctrine of comparative cost <\s>
<s> in the united states those things in the production of which labor and capital are most efficient and so earn the largest rewards are precisely the articles entering most largely into our foreign trade <\s>

<s>    it may be considered therefore as established that when two countries trade together in two commodities the exchange value of these commodities relatively to each other will adjust itself to the inclinations and circumstances of the consumers on both sides in such manner that the quantities required by each country of the articles which it imports from its neighbor shall be exactly sufficient to pay for one another <\s>

<s> in so far as the productions of any country possess this property the country obtains all foreign commodities at less cost <\s>

<s> a country which desires few foreign productions and only a limited quantity of them while its own commodities are in great request in foreign countries will obtain its limited imports at extremely small cost that is in exchange for the produce of a very small quantity of its labor and capital <\s>
<s> the law which we have now illustrated may be appropriately named the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> it may be concisely stated as follows the produce of a country exchanges for the produce of other countries at such values as are required in order that the whole of her exports may exactly pay for the whole of her imports <\s>
<s> this law of international values is but an extension of the more general law of value which we called the equation of supply and demand 270 we have seen that the value of a commodity always so adjusts itself as to bring the demand to the exact level of the supply <\s>

<s> 2 but in the other sense that of cost a country gets a commodity cheaper when it obtains a greater quantity of the commodity with the same expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>
<s> the labor of one country may be as a whole much more efficient than that of another all or most of the commodities capable of being produced in both may be produced in one at less absolute cost than in the other which as we have seen will not necessarily prevent the two countries from exchanging commodities <\s>
<s> the things which the more favored country will import from others are of course those in which it is least superior but by importing them it acquires even in those commodities the same advantage which it possesses in the articles it gives in exchange for them <\s>
<s> what her imports cost to her is a function of two variables 1 the quantity of her own commodities which she gives for them and 2 the cost of those commodities <\s>
<s> of these the last alone depends on the efficiency of her labor the first depends on the law of international values that is on the intensity and extensibility of the foreign demand for her commodities compared with her demand for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the great productiveness of any industry in our country has thus two results 1 it gives a larger total out of which labor and capital at home can receive greater rewards and 2 the commodities being cheaper in comparison than other commodities not so easily produced furnish the very articles which are most likely to be sent abroad in accordance with the doctrine of comparative cost <\s>

<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>

<s> if we are speaking not of the value of money but of its cost that is the quantity of the countrys labor which must be expended to obtain it we must add 5 to these four conditions of cheapness a fifth condition namely    whose productive industry is the most efficient    this last however does not at all affect the value of money estimated in commodities it affects the general abundance and facility with which all things money and commodities together can be obtained 273 the accompanying chart no <\s>

<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>

<s> there is nothing in the peculiar nature or uses of the precious metals which should make them an exception to the general principles of demand <\s>

<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>
<s> the labor of one country may be as a whole much more efficient than that of another all or most of the commodities capable of being produced in both may be produced in one at less absolute cost than in the other which as we have seen will not necessarily prevent the two countries from exchanging commodities <\s>
<s> the things which the more favored country will import from others are of course those in which it is least superior but by importing them it acquires even in those commodities the same advantage which it possesses in the articles it gives in exchange for them <\s>

<s> of these the last alone depends on the efficiency of her labor the first depends on the law of international values that is on the intensity and extensibility of the foreign demand for her commodities compared with her demand for foreign commodities <\s>

<s> we now pass to another essential part of the theory of the subject <\s>
<s> there are two senses in which a country obtains commodities cheaper by foreign trade in the sense of value and in the sense of cost 1 it gets them cheaper in the first sense by their falling in value relatively to other things the same quantity of them exchanging in the country for a smaller quantity than before of the other produce of the country <\s>
<s> to revert to our original figures of the trade with germany in cloth and linen ]: in england all consumers of linen obtained after the trade was opened seventeen or some greater number of yards for the same quantity of all other things for which they before obtained only fifteen <\s>
<s> the degree of cheapness in this sense of the term depends on the laws of international demand so copiously illustrated in the preceding sections <\s>
<s> 2 but in the other sense that of cost a country gets a commodity cheaper when it obtains a greater quantity of the commodity with the same expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>
<s> the labor of one country may be as a whole much more efficient than that of another all or most of the commodities capable of being produced in both may be produced in one at less absolute cost than in the other which as we have seen will not necessarily prevent the two countries from exchanging commodities <\s>
<s> the things which the more favored country will import from others are of course those in which it is least superior but by importing them it acquires even in those commodities the same advantage which it possesses in the articles it gives in exchange for them <\s>
<s> what her imports cost to her is a function of two variables 1 the quantity of her own commodities which she gives for them and 2 the cost of those commodities <\s>
<s> of these the last alone depends on the efficiency of her labor the first depends on the law of international values that is on the intensity and extensibility of the foreign demand for her commodities compared with her demand for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the great productiveness of any industry in our country has thus two results 1 it gives a larger total out of which labor and capital at home can receive greater rewards and 2 the commodities being cheaper in comparison than other commodities not so easily produced furnish the very articles which are most likely to be sent abroad in accordance with the doctrine of comparative cost <\s>
<s> in the united states those things in the production of which labor and capital are most efficient and so earn the largest rewards are precisely the articles entering most largely into our foreign trade <\s>
<s> that is we get foreign articles cheaper precisely because these exports cost us less in labor and capital <\s>
<s> these of course since we inhabit a country whose natural resources are not yet fully worked are largely the products of the extractive industries as may be seen by the following table of the value of goods entering to the greatest extent into our foreign export trade in 1883 raw cotton 247,328 721 breadstuffs 208,040 850 provisions and animals 118,177 555 mineral oils 40,555 492 wood 26,793 708 tobacco 22,095 229 these six classes of commodities are arranged in the order in which they enter into our export trade and are the six which come first and highest in the list <\s>

<s> the degree of progress which we have now made in the theory of foreign trade puts it in our power to supply what was previously deficient in our view of the theory of money and this when completed will in its turn enable us to conclude the subject of foreign trade <\s>

<s> we now pass to another essential part of the theory of the subject <\s>
<s> there are two senses in which a country obtains commodities cheaper by foreign trade in the sense of value and in the sense of cost 1 it gets them cheaper in the first sense by their falling in value relatively to other things the same quantity of them exchanging in the country for a smaller quantity than before of the other produce of the country <\s>
<s> to revert to our original figures of the trade with germany in cloth and linen ]: in england all consumers of linen obtained after the trade was opened seventeen or some greater number of yards for the same quantity of all other things for which they before obtained only fifteen <\s>
<s> the degree of cheapness in this sense of the term depends on the laws of international demand so copiously illustrated in the preceding sections <\s>
<s> 2 but in the other sense that of cost a country gets a commodity cheaper when it obtains a greater quantity of the commodity with the same expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>
<s> the labor of one country may be as a whole much more efficient than that of another all or most of the commodities capable of being produced in both may be produced in one at less absolute cost than in the other which as we have seen will not necessarily prevent the two countries from exchanging commodities <\s>
<s> the things which the more favored country will import from others are of course those in which it is least superior but by importing them it acquires even in those commodities the same advantage which it possesses in the articles it gives in exchange for them <\s>
<s> what her imports cost to her is a function of two variables 1 the quantity of her own commodities which she gives for them and 2 the cost of those commodities <\s>
<s> of these the last alone depends on the efficiency of her labor the first depends on the law of international values that is on the intensity and extensibility of the foreign demand for her commodities compared with her demand for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the great productiveness of any industry in our country has thus two results 1 it gives a larger total out of which labor and capital at home can receive greater rewards and 2 the commodities being cheaper in comparison than other commodities not so easily produced furnish the very articles which are most likely to be sent abroad in accordance with the doctrine of comparative cost <\s>

<s> there are two senses in which a country obtains commodities cheaper by foreign trade in the sense of value and in the sense of cost 1 it gets them cheaper in the first sense by their falling in value relatively to other things the same quantity of them exchanging in the country for a smaller quantity than before of the other produce of the country <\s>

<s> 2 but in the other sense that of cost a country gets a commodity cheaper when it obtains a greater quantity of the commodity with the same expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>
<s> the labor of one country may be as a whole much more efficient than that of another all or most of the commodities capable of being produced in both may be produced in one at less absolute cost than in the other which as we have seen will not necessarily prevent the two countries from exchanging commodities <\s>
<s> the things which the more favored country will import from others are of course those in which it is least superior but by importing them it acquires even in those commodities the same advantage which it possesses in the articles it gives in exchange for them <\s>
<s> what her imports cost to her is a function of two variables 1 the quantity of her own commodities which she gives for them and 2 the cost of those commodities <\s>
<s> of these the last alone depends on the efficiency of her labor the first depends on the law of international values that is on the intensity and extensibility of the foreign demand for her commodities compared with her demand for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the great productiveness of any industry in our country has thus two results 1 it gives a larger total out of which labor and capital at home can receive greater rewards and 2 the commodities being cheaper in comparison than other commodities not so easily produced furnish the very articles which are most likely to be sent abroad in accordance with the doctrine of comparative cost <\s>
<s> in the united states those things in the production of which labor and capital are most efficient and so earn the largest rewards are precisely the articles entering most largely into our foreign trade <\s>

<s>    it may be considered therefore as established that when two countries trade together in two commodities the exchange value of these commodities relatively to each other will adjust itself to the inclinations and circumstances of the consumers on both sides in such manner that the quantities required by each country of the articles which it imports from its neighbor shall be exactly sufficient to pay for one another <\s>

<s> in so far as the productions of any country possess this property the country obtains all foreign commodities at less cost <\s>

<s> a country which desires few foreign productions and only a limited quantity of them while its own commodities are in great request in foreign countries will obtain its limited imports at extremely small cost that is in exchange for the produce of a very small quantity of its labor and capital <\s>
<s> the law which we have now illustrated may be appropriately named the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> it may be concisely stated as follows the produce of a country exchanges for the produce of other countries at such values as are required in order that the whole of her exports may exactly pay for the whole of her imports <\s>
<s> this law of international values is but an extension of the more general law of value which we called the equation of supply and demand 270 we have seen that the value of a commodity always so adjusts itself as to bring the demand to the exact level of the supply <\s>

<s> 2 but in the other sense that of cost a country gets a commodity cheaper when it obtains a greater quantity of the commodity with the same expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>
<s> the labor of one country may be as a whole much more efficient than that of another all or most of the commodities capable of being produced in both may be produced in one at less absolute cost than in the other which as we have seen will not necessarily prevent the two countries from exchanging commodities <\s>
<s> the things which the more favored country will import from others are of course those in which it is least superior but by importing them it acquires even in those commodities the same advantage which it possesses in the articles it gives in exchange for them <\s>
<s> what her imports cost to her is a function of two variables 1 the quantity of her own commodities which she gives for them and 2 the cost of those commodities <\s>
<s> of these the last alone depends on the efficiency of her labor the first depends on the law of international values that is on the intensity and extensibility of the foreign demand for her commodities compared with her demand for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the great productiveness of any industry in our country has thus two results 1 it gives a larger total out of which labor and capital at home can receive greater rewards and 2 the commodities being cheaper in comparison than other commodities not so easily produced furnish the very articles which are most likely to be sent abroad in accordance with the doctrine of comparative cost <\s>

<s> the conclusion states in the equation of international demand <\s>
<s>    it may be considered therefore as established that when two countries trade together in two commodities the exchange value of these commodities relatively to each other will adjust itself to the inclinations and circumstances of the consumers on both sides in such manner that the quantities required by each country of the articles which it imports from its neighbor shall be exactly sufficient to pay for one another <\s>
<s> as the inclinations and circumstances of consumers can not be reduced to any rule so neither can the proportions in which the two commodities will be interchanged <\s>
<s> we know that the limits within which the variation is confined are the ratio between their costs of production in the one country and the ratio between their costs of production in the other <\s>
<s> ten yards of cloth can not exchange for more than twenty yards of linen nor for less than fifteen <\s>
<s> but they may exchange for any intermediate number <\s>
<s> the ratios therefore in which the advantage of the trade may be divided between the two nations are various <\s>
<s> the circumstances on which the proportionate share of each country more remotely depends admit only of a very general indication    if therefore it be asked what country draws to itself the greatest share of the advantage of any trade it carries on the answer is the country for whose productions there is in other countries the greatest demand and a demand the most susceptible of increase from additional cheapness <\s>
<s> in so far as the productions of any country possess this property the country obtains all foreign commodities at less cost <\s>
<s> it gets its imports cheaper the greater the intensity of the demand in foreign countries for its exports <\s>
<s> it also gets its imports cheaper the less the extent and intensity of its own demand for them <\s>
<s> the market is cheapest to those whose demand is small <\s>
<s> a country which desires few foreign productions and only a limited quantity of them while its own commodities are in great request in foreign countries will obtain its limited imports at extremely small cost that is in exchange for the produce of a very small quantity of its labor and capital <\s>
<s> the law which we have now illustrated may be appropriately named the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> it may be concisely stated as follows the produce of a country exchanges for the produce of other countries at such values as are required in order that the whole of her exports may exactly pay for the whole of her imports <\s>
<s> this law of international values is but an extension of the more general law of value which we called the equation of supply and demand 270 we have seen that the value of a commodity always so adjusts itself as to bring the demand to the exact level of the supply <\s>
<s> but all trade either between nations or individuals is an interchange of commodities in which the things that they respectively have to sell constitute also their means of purchase the supply brought by the one constitutes his demand for what is brought by the other <\s>
<s> so that supply and demand are but another expression for reciprocal demand and to say that value will adjust itself so as to equalize demand with supply is in fact to say that it will adjust itself so as to equalize the demand on one side with the demand on the other <\s>
<s> the tendency of imports to balance exports may be seen from chart no <\s>
<s> xiii on the next page which shows the relation between the exports and imports solely of merchandise and exclusive of specie to and from the united states <\s>
<s> from 1850 to 1860 after the discoveries of the precious metals in this country we sent great quantities of gold and silver out of the country purely as merchandise so that if we should include the precious metals among the exports in those years the total exports would more nearly equal the total imports <\s>
<s> the transmission of gold at that time was effected exactly as that of other merchandise so that to the date of the civil war there was a very evident equilibrium between exports and imports <\s>
<s> then came the war with the period of extravagance and speculation following which led to great purchases abroad and which was closed only by the panic of 1873 <\s>
<s> since then more exports than imports were needed to pay for the great purchases of the former period and the epoch of great exports from 1875 to 1883 balanced the opposite conditions in the period preceding <\s>
<s> it would seem therefore that we had reached a normal period about the year 1882 271 a fuller statement as to the fluctuations of exports and imports about the equilibrium will be given when the introduction of money in international trade is made <\s>
<s> the full statement must also include the financial account <\s>
<s> illustration chart xiii chart xiii <\s>
<s> value of merchandise imported into dotted line and exported from black line the united states from 1835 to 1883 <\s>
<s> the cost to a country of its imports depends not only on the ratio of exchange but on the efficiency of its labor <\s>
<s> we now pass to another essential part of the theory of the subject <\s>
<s> there are two senses in which a country obtains commodities cheaper by foreign trade in the sense of value and in the sense of cost 1 it gets them cheaper in the first sense by their falling in value relatively to other things the same quantity of them exchanging in the country for a smaller quantity than before of the other produce of the country <\s>
<s> to revert to our original figures of the trade with germany in cloth and linen ]: in england all consumers of linen obtained after the trade was opened seventeen or some greater number of yards for the same quantity of all other things for which they before obtained only fifteen <\s>
<s> the degree of cheapness in this sense of the term depends on the laws of international demand so copiously illustrated in the preceding sections <\s>
<s> 2 but in the other sense that of cost a country gets a commodity cheaper when it obtains a greater quantity of the commodity with the same expenditure of labor and capital <\s>
<s> in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor <\s>
<s> the labor of one country may be as a whole much more efficient than that of another all or most of the commodities capable of being produced in both may be produced in one at less absolute cost than in the other which as we have seen will not necessarily prevent the two countries from exchanging commodities <\s>
<s> the things which the more favored country will import from others are of course those in which it is least superior but by importing them it acquires even in those commodities the same advantage which it possesses in the articles it gives in exchange for them <\s>
<s> what her imports cost to her is a function of two variables 1 the quantity of her own commodities which she gives for them and 2 the cost of those commodities <\s>
<s> of these the last alone depends on the efficiency of her labor the first depends on the law of international values that is on the intensity and extensibility of the foreign demand for her commodities compared with her demand for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the great productiveness of any industry in our country has thus two results 1 it gives a larger total out of which labor and capital at home can receive greater rewards and 2 the commodities being cheaper in comparison than other commodities not so easily produced furnish the very articles which are most likely to be sent abroad in accordance with the doctrine of comparative cost <\s>
<s> in the united states those things in the production of which labor and capital are most efficient and so earn the largest rewards are precisely the articles entering most largely into our foreign trade <\s>
<s> that is we get foreign articles cheaper precisely because these exports cost us less in labor and capital <\s>
<s> these of course since we inhabit a country whose natural resources are not yet fully worked are largely the products of the extractive industries as may be seen by the following table of the value of goods entering to the greatest extent into our foreign export trade in 1883 raw cotton 247,328 721 breadstuffs 208,040 850 provisions and animals 118,177 555 mineral oils 40,555 492 wood 26,793 708 tobacco 22,095 229 these six classes of commodities are arranged in the order in which they enter into our export trade and are the six which come first and highest in the list <\s>
<s> of money considered as an imported commodity <\s>
<s> money imported on two modes as a commodity and as a medium of exchange <\s>
<s> the degree of progress which we have now made in the theory of foreign trade puts it in our power to supply what was previously deficient in our view of the theory of money and this when completed will in its turn enable us to conclude the subject of foreign trade <\s>
<s> money or the material of which it is composed is in great britain and in most other countries a foreign commodity <\s>
<s> its value and distribution must therefore be regulated not by the law of value which obtains in adjacent places but by that which is applicable to imported commoditiesthe law of international values <\s>
<s> in the discussion into which we are now about to enter i shall use the terms money and the precious metals indiscriminately <\s>
<s> this may be done without leading to any error it having been shown that the value of money when it consists of the precious metals or of a paper currency convertible into them on demand is entirely governed by the value of the metals themselves from which it never permanently differs except by the expense of coinage when this is paid by the individual and not by the state <\s>
<s> money is brought into a country in two different ways <\s>
<s> it is imported chiefly in the form of bullion like any other merchandise as being an advantageous article of commerce <\s>
<s> it is also imported in its other character of a medium of exchange to pay some debt due to the country either for goods exported or on any other account <\s>
<s> the existence of these two distinct modes in which money flows into a country while other commodities are habitually introduced only in the first of these modes occasions somewhat more of complexity and obscurity than exists in the case of other commodities and for this reason only is any special and minute exposition necessary <\s>
<s> as a commodity it obeys the same laws of value as other imported commodities <\s>
<s> in so far as the precious metals are imported in the ordinary way of commerce their value must depend on the same causes and conform to the same laws as the value of any other foreign production <\s>
<s> it is in this mode chiefly that gold and silver diffuse themselves from the mining countries into all other parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> they are the staple commodities of those countries or at least are among their great articles of regular export and are shipped on speculation in the same manner as other exportable commodities <\s>
<s> the quantity therefore which a country say england will give of its own produce for a certain quantity of bullion will depend if we suppose only two countries and two commodities upon the demand in england for bullion compared with the demand in the mining country which we will call the united states 272 for what england has to give <\s>
<s> the bullion required by england must exactly pay for the cottons or other english commodities required by the united states <\s>
<s> if however we substitute for this simplicity the degree of complication which really exists the equation of international demand must be established not between the bullion wanted in england and the cottons or broadcloth wanted in the united states but between the whole of the imports of england and the whole of her exports <\s>
<s> the demand in foreign countries for english products must be brought into equilibrium with the demand in england for the products of foreign countries and all foreign commodities bullion among the rest must be exchanged against english products in such proportions as will by the effect they produce on the demand establish this equilibrium <\s>
<s> there is nothing in the peculiar nature or uses of the precious metals which should make them an exception to the general principles of demand <\s>
<s> so far as they are wanted for purposes of luxury or the arts the demand increases with the cheapness in the same irregular way as the demand for any other commodity <\s>
<s> so far as they are required for money the demand increases with the cheapness in a perfectly regular way the quantity needed being always in inverse proportion to the value <\s>
<s> this is the only real difference in respect to demand between money and other things <\s>
<s> money then if imported solely as a merchandise will like other imported commodities be of lowest value in the countries for whose exports there is the greatest foreign demand and which have themselves the least demand for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> to these two circumstances it is however necessary to add two others which produce their effect through cost of carriage <\s>
<s> the cost of obtaining bullion is compounded of two elements the goods given to purchase it and the expense of transport of which last the bullion countries will bear a part though an uncertain part in the adjustment of international values <\s>
<s> the expense of transport is partly that of carrying the goods to the bullion countries and partly that of bringing back the bullion both these items are influenced by the distance from the mines and the former is also much affected by the bulkiness of the goods <\s>
<s> countries whose exportable produce consists of the finer manufactures obtain bullion as well as all other foreign articles c  teris paribus at less expense than countries which export nothing but bulky raw produce <\s>
<s> to be quite accurate therefore we must say the countries whose exportable productions 1 are most in demand abroad and 2 contain greatest value in smallest bulk 3 which are nearest to the mines and 4 which have least demand for foreign productions are those in which money will be of lowest value or in other words in which prices will habitually range the highest <\s>
<s> if we are speaking not of the value of money but of its cost that is the quantity of the countrys labor which must be expended to obtain it we must add 5 to these four conditions of cheapness a fifth condition namely    whose productive industry is the most efficient    this last however does not at all affect the value of money estimated in commodities it affects the general abundance and facility with which all things money and commodities together can be obtained 273 the accompanying chart no <\s>
<s> xiv on the next page gives the excess of exports from the united states of gold and silver coin and bullion over imports and the excess of imports over exports <\s>
<s> the movement of the line above the horizontal baseline shows distinctly how largely we have been sending the precious metals abroad from our mines simply as a regular article of export like merchandise <\s>
<s> from 1850 to 1879 the exports are clearly not in the nature of payments for trade balances since it indicates a steady movement out of the country with the exception of the first year of the war when gold came to this country <\s>
<s> the phenomenal increase of specie exports during the war and until 1879 was due to the fact that we had a depreciated paper currency which sent the metals out of the country as merchandise <\s>
<s> this chart should be studied in connection with chart no <\s>
<s> illustration chart xiv chart xiv <\s>
<s> chart showing the excess of exports and imports of gold and silver coin and bullion from and into the united states from 1835 to 1883 <\s>
<s> the line when above the base line shows the excess of exports when below the excess of imports from the preceding considerations it appears that those are greatly in error who contend that the value of money in countries where it is an imported commodity must be entirely regulated by its value in the countries which produce it and can not be raised or lowered in any permanent manner unless some change has taken place in the cost of production at the mines <\s>
<s> on the contrary any circumstance which disturbs the equation of international demand with respect to a particular country not only may but must affect the value of money in that countryits value at the mines remaining the same <\s>
<s> the opening of a new branch of export trade from england an increase in the foreign demand for english products either by the natural course of events or by the abrogation of duties a check to the demand in england for foreign commodities by the laying on of import duties in england or of export duties elsewhere these and all other events of similar tendency would make the imports of england bullion and other things taken together no longer an equivalent for the exports and the countries which take her exports would be obliged to offer their commodities and bullion among the rest on cheaper terms in order to re establish the equation of demand and thus england would obtain money cheaper and would acquire a generally higher range of prices <\s>
<s> a country which from any of the causes mentioned gets money cheaper obtains all its other imports cheaper likewise <\s>
<s> it is by no means necessary that the increased demand for english commodities which enables england to supply herself with bullion at a cheaper rate should be a demand in the mining countries <\s>
<s> england might export nothing whatever to those countries and yet might be the country which obtained bullion from them on the lowest terms provided there were a sufficient intensity of demand in other foreign countries for english goods which would be paid for circuitously with gold and silver from the mining countries <\s>
<s> the whole of its exports are what a country exchanges against the whole of its imports and not its exports and imports to and from any one country <\s>
<s> of the foreign exchanges <\s>
<s> money passes from country to country as a medium of exchange through the exchanges <\s>
<s> we have thus far considered the precious metals as a commodity imported like other commodities in the common course of trade and have examined what are the circumstances which would in that case determine their value <\s>
<s> but those metals are also imported in another character that which belongs to them as a medium of exchange not as an article of commerce to be sold for money but as themselves money to pay a debt or effect a transfer of property <\s>

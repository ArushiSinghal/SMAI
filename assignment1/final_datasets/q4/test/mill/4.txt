<s> this popular error comes from attending to a small portion only of the consequences that flow from the saving or the spending all the effects of either which are out of sight being out of mind <\s>

<s> the word saving does not imply that what is saved is not consumed nor even necessarily that its consumption is deferred but only that if consumed immediately it is not consumed by the person who saves it <\s>
<s> if merely laid by for future use it is said to be hoarded and while hoarded is not consumed at all <\s>

<s> this popular error comes from attending to a small portion only of the consequences that flow from the saving or the spending all the effects of either which are out of sight being out of mind <\s>

<s> almost all expenditure being carried on by means of money the money comes to be looked upon as the main feature in the transaction and since that does not perish but only changes hands people overlook the destruction which takes place in the case of unproductive expenditure <\s>

<s> when people talk of the ancient wealth of a country of riches inherited from ancestors and similar expressions the idea suggested is that the riches so transmitted were produced long ago at the time when they are said to have been first acquired and that no portion of the capital of the country was produced this year except as much as may have been this year added to the total amount <\s>
<s> the fact is far otherwise <\s>
<s> the food of laborers and the materials of production have no productive power but labor can not exert its productive power unless provided with them <\s>
<s> there can be no more industry than is supplied with materials to work up and food to eat <\s>
<s> self evident as the thing is it is often forgotten that the people of a country are maintained and have their wants supplied not by the produce of present labor but of past <\s>
<s> therefore as capital increases more labor can be employed <\s>
<s> when the pittsburg rioters in 1877 destroyed property or the product of past labor they did not realize then that that property might but now could never again be employed for productive purposes and thereby support laborers <\s>

<s> now of what has been produced a part only is allotted to the support of productive labor and there will not and can not be more of that labor than the portion so allotted which is the capital of the country can feed and provide with the materials and instruments of production <\s>

<s> the fund holder when paid off would still desire to draw an income from his property most of which therefore would find its way into productive employment while a great part of it would have been drawn from the fund for unproductive expenditure since people do not wholly pay their taxes from what they would have saved but partly if not chiefly from what they would have spent <\s>
<s> increase of capital gives increased employment to labor without assignable bounds <\s>

<s> when people talk of the ancient wealth of a country of riches inherited from ancestors and similar expressions the idea suggested is that the riches so transmitted were produced long ago at the time when they are said to have been first acquired and that no portion of the capital of the country was produced this year except as much as may have been this year added to the total amount <\s>
<s> the fact is far otherwise <\s>
<s> the food of laborers and the materials of production have no productive power but labor can not exert its productive power unless provided with them <\s>

<s> the fund holder when paid off would still desire to draw an income from his property most of which therefore would find its way into productive employment while a great part of it would have been drawn from the fund for unproductive expenditure since people do not wholly pay their taxes from what they would have saved but partly if not chiefly from what they would have spent <\s>
<s> increase of capital gives increased employment to labor without assignable bounds <\s>
<s> while on the one hand industry is limited by capital so on the other every increase of capital gives or is capable of giving additional employment to industry and this without assignable limit <\s>
<s> i do not mean to deny that the capital or part of it may be so employed as not to support laborers being fixed in machinery buildings improvement of land and the like <\s>
<s> in any large increase of capital a considerable portion will generally be thus employed and will only co operate with laborers not maintain them <\s>
<s> it will be remembered however that subsistence is but one part or element of capital that instruments and materials form a large part of capital <\s>

<s> mill has in view the fact that laborers may exist in the community either    half fed or unemployed    what i do intend to assert is that the portion which is destined to their maintenance may supposing no alteration in anything else be indefinitely increased without creating an impossibility of finding the employment in other words that if there are human beings capable of work and food to feed them they may always be employed in producing something <\s>
<s> it is very much opposed to common doctrines 106 there is not an opinion more general among mankind than this that the unproductive expenditure of the rich is necessary to the employment of the poor <\s>
<s> it is to be noticed that in fact after the arts have so far advanced in a community that mankind can obtain by their exertion more than the amount of the mere necessaries of life sufficient on the average for the subsistence of all any further production rendered possible to the human race by new discoveries and processes is naturally unproductively consumed and that consequently a demand for labor for unproductive consumption is essential for the employment of all existing laborers <\s>
<s> this however can be done because enough capital has been brought into existence to create the demand for the labor <\s>
<s> yet it is clear that it is not expenditure but capital by which employment is given to the poor <\s>
<s> suppose that every capitalist came to be of opinion that not being more meritorious than a well conducted laborer he ought not to fare better and accordingly laid by from conscientious motives the surplus of his profits unproductive expenditure is now reduced to its lowest limit and it is asked how is the increased capital to find employment <\s>
<s> who is to buy the goods which it will produce <\s>
<s> there are no longer customers even for those which were produced before <\s>
<s> the goods therefore it is said will remain unsold they will perish in the warehouses until capital is brought down to what it was originally or rather to as much less as the demand of the customers has lessened <\s>
<s> but this is seeing only one half of the matter <\s>
<s> in the case supposed there would no longer be any demand for luxuries on the part of capitalists and land owners <\s>
<s> but when these classes turn their income into capital they do not thereby annihilate their power of consumption they do but transfer it from themselves to the laborers to whom they give employment <\s>
<s> now there are two possible suppositions in regard to the laborers either there is or there is not an increase of their numbers proportional to the increase of capital <\s>
<s> 1 if there is the case offers no difficulty <\s>
<s> the production of necessaries for the new population takes the place of the production of luxuries for a portion of the old and supplies exactly the amount of employment which has been lost <\s>
<s> 2 but suppose that there is no increase of population <\s>
<s> the whole of what was previously expended in luxuries by capitalists and landlords is distributed among the existing laborers in the form of additional wages <\s>
<s> we will assume them to be already sufficiently supplied with necessaries <\s>
<s> that the laborers become consumers of luxuries and the capital previously employed in the production of luxuries is still able to employ itself in the same manner the difference being that the luxuries are shared among the community generally instead of being confined to a few supposing that the power of their labor were physically sufficient to produce all this amount of indulgences for their whole number <\s>
<s> thus the limit of wealth is never deficiency of consumers but of producers and productive power <\s>
<s> every addition to capital gives to labor either additional employment or additional remuneration <\s>

<s>    the limit of wealth is never deficiency of consumers    but of productive power <\s>
<s> now in supposition 2 of the text remember that the laborers are supposed not to be employed up to their full productive power <\s>
<s> if all capitalists abstain from unproductive consumption and devote that amount of wealth to production then since there can be no production without labor the same number of laborers have offered to them in the aggregate a larger sum of articles for their exertions which is equivalent to saying they receive additional wages <\s>
<s> but some persons want to see the process in the concrete and the same principle may be illustrated by a practical case <\s>
<s> it is supposed that all laborers have the necessaries of life only but none of the comforts decencies and luxuries <\s>
<s> let a be a farmer in new york who can also weave carpets and b a lumberman in maine <\s>

<s> one of the capitalists abstaining from unproductive consumption as above is x who knowing the two desires of a and b presents himself as a middle man i e he gives a market for both men as is found in every center of trade as well as in a country store furnishing a the tools materials etc and giving him the promise of lumber if he will create the carpet and promising b the carpet if he will likewise produce the additional lumber <\s>
<s> to be more matter of fact x buys the carpet of a and sells it to b for the lumber <\s>
<s> thus two new articles have been created and for their exertions a has received additional wages either in the form of lumber or of the money paid him for the carpet and b has received additional wages either in the form of a carpet or the money paid him by x for the lumber <\s>
<s> if a and b are regarded as typifying all the laborers and x all the above capitalists in the multiplicity of actual exchanges it will be seen that a and b are creating new articles to satisfy their own demand instead of meeting the demands of x <\s>
<s> if their primary wants are already supplied then they take their additional wages in the form of comforts and decencies <\s>
<s> when class x forego their consumption but add that amount to capital they do not give up their title to that capital but they transfer the use of it or their consuming power to others for the time being <\s>

<s> nevertheless there is here an increase of saving in the scientific sense <\s>
<s> though there is more consumed there is also more spared <\s>
<s> there is a greater excess of production over consumption <\s>
<s> to consume less than is produced is saving and that is the process by which capital is increased not necessarily by consuming less absolutely <\s>

<s> to explain the process by which capital comes into existence bastiat has given the well known illustration of the plane in his    sophisms of protection    107 a fundamental theorem respecting capital closely connected with the one last discussed is that although saved and the result of saving it is nevertheless consumed <\s>
<s> the word saving does not imply that what is saved is not consumed nor even necessarily that its consumption is deferred but only that if consumed immediately it is not consumed by the person who saves it <\s>

<s> to them every one who saves appears in the light of a person who hoards <\s>

<s> this popular error comes from attending to a small portion only of the consequences that flow from the saving or the spending all the effects of either which are out of sight being out of mind <\s>

<s> almost all expenditure being carried on by means of money the money comes to be looked upon as the main feature in the transaction and since that does not perish but only changes hands people overlook the destruction which takes place in the case of unproductive expenditure <\s>

<s> when people talk of the ancient wealth of a country of riches inherited from ancestors and similar expressions the idea suggested is that the riches so transmitted were produced long ago at the time when they are said to have been first acquired and that no portion of the capital of the country was produced this year except as much as may have been this year added to the total amount <\s>
<s> the fact is far otherwise <\s>
<s> the food of laborers and the materials of production have no productive power but labor can not exert its productive power unless provided with them <\s>

<s> self evident as the thing is it is often forgotten that the people of a country are maintained and have their wants supplied not by the produce of present labor but of past <\s>

<s> now of what has been produced a part only is allotted to the support of productive labor and there will not and can not be more of that labor than the portion so allotted which is the capital of the country can feed and provide with the materials and instruments of production <\s>
<s> because industry is limited by capital we are not however to infer that it always reaches that limit <\s>

<s> they may do what is nearly equivalent they may lay taxes on income or expenditure and apply the proceeds toward paying off the public debts <\s>

<s> the word saving does not imply that what is saved is not consumed nor even necessarily that its consumption is deferred but only that if consumed immediately it is not consumed by the person who saves it <\s>
<s> if merely laid by for future use it is said to be hoarded and while hoarded is not consumed at all <\s>

<s> to them every one who saves appears in the light of a person who hoards <\s>
<s> the person who expends his fortune in unproductive consumption is looked upon as diffusing benefits all around and is an object of so much favor that some portion of the same popularity attaches even to him who spends what does not belong to him who not only destroys his own capital if he ever had any but under pretense of borrowing and on promise of repayment possesses himself of capital belonging to others and destroys that likewise <\s>
<s> this popular error comes from attending to a small portion only of the consequences that flow from the saving or the spending all the effects of either which are out of sight being out of mind <\s>

<s> everything which is produced is consumedboth what is saved and what is said to be spentand the former quite as rapidly as the latter <\s>
<s> all the ordinary forms of language tend to disguise this <\s>
<s> when people talk of the ancient wealth of a country of riches inherited from ancestors and similar expressions the idea suggested is that the riches so transmitted were produced long ago at the time when they are said to have been first acquired and that no portion of the capital of the country was produced this year except as much as may have been this year added to the total amount <\s>
<s> the fact is far otherwise <\s>
<s> the food of laborers and the materials of production have no productive power but labor can not exert its productive power unless provided with them <\s>
<s> there can be no more industry than is supplied with materials to work up and food to eat <\s>
<s> self evident as the thing is it is often forgotten that the people of a country are maintained and have their wants supplied not by the produce of present labor but of past <\s>
<s> therefore as capital increases more labor can be employed <\s>
<s> when the pittsburg rioters in 1877 destroyed property or the product of past labor they did not realize then that that property might but now could never again be employed for productive purposes and thereby support laborers <\s>
<s> they consume what has been produced not what is about to be produced <\s>
<s> now of what has been produced a part only is allotted to the support of productive labor and there will not and can not be more of that labor than the portion so allotted which is the capital of the country can feed and provide with the materials and instruments of production <\s>
<s> because industry is limited by capital we are not however to infer that it always reaches that limit <\s>
<s> there may not be as many laborers obtainable as the capital would maintain and employ <\s>
<s> this has been known to occur in new colonies where capital has sometimes perished uselessly for want of labor <\s>

<s> in earlier days president john adams was unable to hire a man in washington to cut wood in the surrounding forests with which to warm the white house <\s>
<s> the unproductive consumption of productive laborers the whole of which is now supplied by capital might cease or be postponed until the produce came in and additional productive laborers might be maintained with the amount <\s>
<s> governments can create capital <\s>
<s> they may lay on taxes and employ the amount productively <\s>
<s> they may do what is nearly equivalent they may lay taxes on income or expenditure and apply the proceeds toward paying off the public debts <\s>
<s> the fund holder when paid off would still desire to draw an income from his property most of which therefore would find its way into productive employment while a great part of it would have been drawn from the fund for unproductive expenditure since people do not wholly pay their taxes from what they would have saved but partly if not chiefly from what they would have spent <\s>
<s> increase of capital gives increased employment to labor without assignable bounds <\s>
<s> while on the one hand industry is limited by capital so on the other every increase of capital gives or is capable of giving additional employment to industry and this without assignable limit <\s>
<s> i do not mean to deny that the capital or part of it may be so employed as not to support laborers being fixed in machinery buildings improvement of land and the like <\s>
<s> in any large increase of capital a considerable portion will generally be thus employed and will only co operate with laborers not maintain them <\s>
<s> it will be remembered however that subsistence is but one part or element of capital that instruments and materials form a large part of capital <\s>
<s> but still the question of mere maintenance is rightfully discussed because it is asserted to day that while the rich are growing richer the poor lack even the food to keep them alive and throughout this discussion mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view the fact that laborers may exist in the community either    half fed or unemployed    what i do intend to assert is that the portion which is destined to their maintenance may supposing no alteration in anything else be indefinitely increased without creating an impossibility of finding the employment in other words that if there are human beings capable of work and food to feed them they may always be employed in producing something <\s>
<s> it is very much opposed to common doctrines 106 there is not an opinion more general among mankind than this that the unproductive expenditure of the rich is necessary to the employment of the poor <\s>
<s> it is to be noticed that in fact after the arts have so far advanced in a community that mankind can obtain by their exertion more than the amount of the mere necessaries of life sufficient on the average for the subsistence of all any further production rendered possible to the human race by new discoveries and processes is naturally unproductively consumed and that consequently a demand for labor for unproductive consumption is essential for the employment of all existing laborers <\s>
<s> this however can be done because enough capital has been brought into existence to create the demand for the labor <\s>
<s> yet it is clear that it is not expenditure but capital by which employment is given to the poor <\s>
<s> suppose that every capitalist came to be of opinion that not being more meritorious than a well conducted laborer he ought not to fare better and accordingly laid by from conscientious motives the surplus of his profits unproductive expenditure is now reduced to its lowest limit and it is asked how is the increased capital to find employment <\s>
<s> who is to buy the goods which it will produce <\s>
<s> there are no longer customers even for those which were produced before <\s>
<s> the goods therefore it is said will remain unsold they will perish in the warehouses until capital is brought down to what it was originally or rather to as much less as the demand of the customers has lessened <\s>
<s> but this is seeing only one half of the matter <\s>
<s> in the case supposed there would no longer be any demand for luxuries on the part of capitalists and land owners <\s>
<s> but when these classes turn their income into capital they do not thereby annihilate their power of consumption they do but transfer it from themselves to the laborers to whom they give employment <\s>
<s> now there are two possible suppositions in regard to the laborers either there is or there is not an increase of their numbers proportional to the increase of capital <\s>
<s> 1 if there is the case offers no difficulty <\s>
<s> the production of necessaries for the new population takes the place of the production of luxuries for a portion of the old and supplies exactly the amount of employment which has been lost <\s>
<s> 2 but suppose that there is no increase of population <\s>
<s> the whole of what was previously expended in luxuries by capitalists and landlords is distributed among the existing laborers in the form of additional wages <\s>
<s> we will assume them to be already sufficiently supplied with necessaries <\s>
<s> that the laborers become consumers of luxuries and the capital previously employed in the production of luxuries is still able to employ itself in the same manner the difference being that the luxuries are shared among the community generally instead of being confined to a few supposing that the power of their labor were physically sufficient to produce all this amount of indulgences for their whole number <\s>
<s> thus the limit of wealth is never deficiency of consumers but of producers and productive power <\s>
<s> every addition to capital gives to labor either additional employment or additional remuneration <\s>
<s> that laborers should get more a by capitalists abstaining from unproductive expenditure than b by expenditure in articles unproductively consumed is a question difficult for many to comprehend and needs all the elucidation possible <\s>

<s> to satisfy these wants is the spring to nearly all production and industry <\s>
<s> there can therefore be no stop to production arising from lack of desire for commodities <\s>
<s>    the limit of wealth is never deficiency of consumers    but of productive power <\s>
<s> now in supposition 2 of the text remember that the laborers are supposed not to be employed up to their full productive power <\s>
<s> if all capitalists abstain from unproductive consumption and devote that amount of wealth to production then since there can be no production without labor the same number of laborers have offered to them in the aggregate a larger sum of articles for their exertions which is equivalent to saying they receive additional wages <\s>

<s> this popular error comes from attending to a small portion only of the consequences that flow from the saving or the spending all the effects of either which are out of sight being out of mind <\s>

<s> there is a greater excess of production over consumption <\s>
<s> to consume less than is produced is saving and that is the process by which capital is increased not necessarily by consuming less absolutely <\s>

<s> to them every one who saves appears in the light of a person who hoards <\s>

<s> this popular error comes from attending to a small portion only of the consequences that flow from the saving or the spending all the effects of either which are out of sight being out of mind <\s>
<s> there is in the one case a wearing out of tools a destruction of material and a quantity of food and clothing supplied to laborers which they destroy by use in the other case there is a consumption that is to say a destruction of wines equipages and furniture <\s>

<s> almost all expenditure being carried on by means of money the money comes to be looked upon as the main feature in the transaction and since that does not perish but only changes hands people overlook the destruction which takes place in the case of unproductive expenditure <\s>

<s> this popular error comes from attending to a small portion only of the consequences that flow from the saving or the spending all the effects of either which are out of sight being out of mind <\s>

<s> when people talk of the ancient wealth of a country of riches inherited from ancestors and similar expressions the idea suggested is that the riches so transmitted were produced long ago at the time when they are said to have been first acquired and that no portion of the capital of the country was produced this year except as much as may have been this year added to the total amount <\s>
<s> the fact is far otherwise <\s>
<s> the food of laborers and the materials of production have no productive power but labor can not exert its productive power unless provided with them <\s>

<s> self evident as the thing is it is often forgotten that the people of a country are maintained and have their wants supplied not by the produce of present labor but of past <\s>

<s> now of what has been produced a part only is allotted to the support of productive labor and there will not and can not be more of that labor than the portion so allotted which is the capital of the country can feed and provide with the materials and instruments of production <\s>

<s> everything which is produced is consumedboth what is saved and what is said to be spentand the former quite as rapidly as the latter <\s>
<s> all the ordinary forms of language tend to disguise this <\s>
<s> when people talk of the ancient wealth of a country of riches inherited from ancestors and similar expressions the idea suggested is that the riches so transmitted were produced long ago at the time when they are said to have been first acquired and that no portion of the capital of the country was produced this year except as much as may have been this year added to the total amount <\s>
<s> the fact is far otherwise <\s>
<s> the food of laborers and the materials of production have no productive power but labor can not exert its productive power unless provided with them <\s>
<s> there can be no more industry than is supplied with materials to work up and food to eat <\s>
<s> self evident as the thing is it is often forgotten that the people of a country are maintained and have their wants supplied not by the produce of present labor but of past <\s>
<s> therefore as capital increases more labor can be employed <\s>
<s> when the pittsburg rioters in 1877 destroyed property or the product of past labor they did not realize then that that property might but now could never again be employed for productive purposes and thereby support laborers <\s>
<s> they consume what has been produced not what is about to be produced <\s>
<s> now of what has been produced a part only is allotted to the support of productive labor and there will not and can not be more of that labor than the portion so allotted which is the capital of the country can feed and provide with the materials and instruments of production <\s>
<s> because industry is limited by capital we are not however to infer that it always reaches that limit <\s>
<s> there may not be as many laborers obtainable as the capital would maintain and employ <\s>
<s> this has been known to occur in new colonies where capital has sometimes perished uselessly for want of labor <\s>
<s> in the farming districts of our middle and western states in harvest time crops have been often of late years ruined because farm hands could not be obtained <\s>
<s> in earlier days president john adams was unable to hire a man in washington to cut wood in the surrounding forests with which to warm the white house <\s>
<s> the unproductive consumption of productive laborers the whole of which is now supplied by capital might cease or be postponed until the produce came in and additional productive laborers might be maintained with the amount <\s>
<s> governments can create capital <\s>
<s> they may lay on taxes and employ the amount productively <\s>
<s> they may do what is nearly equivalent they may lay taxes on income or expenditure and apply the proceeds toward paying off the public debts <\s>
<s> the fund holder when paid off would still desire to draw an income from his property most of which therefore would find its way into productive employment while a great part of it would have been drawn from the fund for unproductive expenditure since people do not wholly pay their taxes from what they would have saved but partly if not chiefly from what they would have spent <\s>
<s> increase of capital gives increased employment to labor without assignable bounds <\s>
<s> while on the one hand industry is limited by capital so on the other every increase of capital gives or is capable of giving additional employment to industry and this without assignable limit <\s>
<s> i do not mean to deny that the capital or part of it may be so employed as not to support laborers being fixed in machinery buildings improvement of land and the like <\s>
<s> in any large increase of capital a considerable portion will generally be thus employed and will only co operate with laborers not maintain them <\s>
<s> it will be remembered however that subsistence is but one part or element of capital that instruments and materials form a large part of capital <\s>
<s> but still the question of mere maintenance is rightfully discussed because it is asserted to day that while the rich are growing richer the poor lack even the food to keep them alive and throughout this discussion mr <\s>
<s> mill has in view the fact that laborers may exist in the community either    half fed or unemployed    what i do intend to assert is that the portion which is destined to their maintenance may supposing no alteration in anything else be indefinitely increased without creating an impossibility of finding the employment in other words that if there are human beings capable of work and food to feed them they may always be employed in producing something <\s>
<s> it is very much opposed to common doctrines 106 there is not an opinion more general among mankind than this that the unproductive expenditure of the rich is necessary to the employment of the poor <\s>
<s> it is to be noticed that in fact after the arts have so far advanced in a community that mankind can obtain by their exertion more than the amount of the mere necessaries of life sufficient on the average for the subsistence of all any further production rendered possible to the human race by new discoveries and processes is naturally unproductively consumed and that consequently a demand for labor for unproductive consumption is essential for the employment of all existing laborers <\s>
<s> this however can be done because enough capital has been brought into existence to create the demand for the labor <\s>
<s> yet it is clear that it is not expenditure but capital by which employment is given to the poor <\s>
<s> suppose that every capitalist came to be of opinion that not being more meritorious than a well conducted laborer he ought not to fare better and accordingly laid by from conscientious motives the surplus of his profits unproductive expenditure is now reduced to its lowest limit and it is asked how is the increased capital to find employment <\s>
<s> who is to buy the goods which it will produce <\s>
<s> there are no longer customers even for those which were produced before <\s>
<s> the goods therefore it is said will remain unsold they will perish in the warehouses until capital is brought down to what it was originally or rather to as much less as the demand of the customers has lessened <\s>
<s> but this is seeing only one half of the matter <\s>
<s> in the case supposed there would no longer be any demand for luxuries on the part of capitalists and land owners <\s>
<s> but when these classes turn their income into capital they do not thereby annihilate their power of consumption they do but transfer it from themselves to the laborers to whom they give employment <\s>
<s> now there are two possible suppositions in regard to the laborers either there is or there is not an increase of their numbers proportional to the increase of capital <\s>
<s> 1 if there is the case offers no difficulty <\s>
<s> the production of necessaries for the new population takes the place of the production of luxuries for a portion of the old and supplies exactly the amount of employment which has been lost <\s>
<s> 2 but suppose that there is no increase of population <\s>
<s> the whole of what was previously expended in luxuries by capitalists and landlords is distributed among the existing laborers in the form of additional wages <\s>
<s> we will assume them to be already sufficiently supplied with necessaries <\s>
<s> that the laborers become consumers of luxuries and the capital previously employed in the production of luxuries is still able to employ itself in the same manner the difference being that the luxuries are shared among the community generally instead of being confined to a few supposing that the power of their labor were physically sufficient to produce all this amount of indulgences for their whole number <\s>
<s> thus the limit of wealth is never deficiency of consumers but of producers and productive power <\s>
<s> every addition to capital gives to labor either additional employment or additional remuneration <\s>
<s> that laborers should get more a by capitalists abstaining from unproductive expenditure than b by expenditure in articles unproductively consumed is a question difficult for many to comprehend and needs all the elucidation possible <\s>
<s> to start with no one ever knew of a community all of whose wants were satisfied in fact civilization is constantly leading us into new fields of enjoyment and results in a constant differentiation of new desires <\s>
<s> to satisfy these wants is the spring to nearly all production and industry <\s>
<s> there can therefore be no stop to production arising from lack of desire for commodities <\s>
<s>    the limit of wealth is never deficiency of consumers    but of productive power <\s>
<s> now in supposition 2 of the text remember that the laborers are supposed not to be employed up to their full productive power <\s>
<s> if all capitalists abstain from unproductive consumption and devote that amount of wealth to production then since there can be no production without labor the same number of laborers have offered to them in the aggregate a larger sum of articles for their exertions which is equivalent to saying they receive additional wages <\s>
<s> but some persons want to see the process in the concrete and the same principle may be illustrated by a practical case <\s>
<s> it is supposed that all laborers have the necessaries of life only but none of the comforts decencies and luxuries <\s>
<s> let a be a farmer in new york who can also weave carpets and b a lumberman in maine <\s>
<s> a begins to want a better house and b wishes a carpet both having food clothing and shelter <\s>
<s> one of the capitalists abstaining from unproductive consumption as above is x who knowing the two desires of a and b presents himself as a middle man i e he gives a market for both men as is found in every center of trade as well as in a country store furnishing a the tools materials etc and giving him the promise of lumber if he will create the carpet and promising b the carpet if he will likewise produce the additional lumber <\s>
<s> to be more matter of fact x buys the carpet of a and sells it to b for the lumber <\s>
<s> thus two new articles have been created and for their exertions a has received additional wages either in the form of lumber or of the money paid him for the carpet and b has received additional wages either in the form of a carpet or the money paid him by x for the lumber <\s>
<s> if a and b are regarded as typifying all the laborers and x all the above capitalists in the multiplicity of actual exchanges it will be seen that a and b are creating new articles to satisfy their own demand instead of meeting the demands of x <\s>
<s> if their primary wants are already supplied then they take their additional wages in the form of comforts and decencies <\s>
<s> when class x forego their consumption but add that amount to capital they do not give up their title to that capital but they transfer the use of it or their consuming power to others for the time being <\s>
<s> this question will be more fully discussed in   6 <\s>
<s> capital is the result of saving and all capital is consumed <\s>
<s> a second fundamental theorem respecting capital relates to the source from which it is derived <\s>
<s> it is the result of saving <\s>
<s> if all persons were to expend in personal indulgences all that they produce and all the income that they receive from what is produced by others capital could not increase <\s>
<s> some saving therefore there must have been even in the simplest of all states of economical relations people must have produced more than they used or used less than they produced <\s>
<s> still more must they do so before they can employ other laborers or increase their production beyond what can be accomplished by the work of their own hands <\s>
<s> if it were said for instance that the only way to accelerate the increase of capital is by increase of saving the idea would probably be suggested of greater abstinence and increased privation <\s>
<s> but it is obvious that whatever increases the productive power of labor creates an additional fund to make savings from and enables capital to be enlarged not only without additional privation but concurrently with an increase of personal consumption <\s>
<s> nevertheless there is here an increase of saving in the scientific sense <\s>
<s> though there is more consumed there is also more spared <\s>
<s> there is a greater excess of production over consumption <\s>
<s> to consume less than is produced is saving and that is the process by which capital is increased not necessarily by consuming less absolutely <\s>
<s> the economic idea of saving involves of course the intention of using the wealth in reproduction <\s>
<s> saving without this meaning results only in hoarding of wealth and while hoarded this amount is not capital <\s>
<s> to explain the process by which capital comes into existence bastiat has given the well known illustration of the plane in his    sophisms of protection    107 a fundamental theorem respecting capital closely connected with the one last discussed is that although saved and the result of saving it is nevertheless consumed <\s>
<s> the word saving does not imply that what is saved is not consumed nor even necessarily that its consumption is deferred but only that if consumed immediately it is not consumed by the person who saves it <\s>
<s> if merely laid by for future use it is said to be hoarded and while hoarded is not consumed at all <\s>
<s> but if employed as capital it is all consumed though not by the capitalist <\s>
<s> part is exchanged for tools or machinery which are worn out by use part for seed or materials which are destroyed as such by being sown or wrought up and destroyed altogether by the consumption of the ultimate product <\s>
<s> the remainder is paid in wages to productive laborers who consume it for their daily wants or if they in their turn save any part this also is not generally speaking hoarded but through savings banks benefit clubs or some other channel re employed as capital and consumed <\s>
<s> to the vulgar it is not at all apparent that what is saved is consumed <\s>
<s> to them every one who saves appears in the light of a person who hoards <\s>
<s> the person who expends his fortune in unproductive consumption is looked upon as diffusing benefits all around and is an object of so much favor that some portion of the same popularity attaches even to him who spends what does not belong to him who not only destroys his own capital if he ever had any but under pretense of borrowing and on promise of repayment possesses himself of capital belonging to others and destroys that likewise <\s>
<s> this popular error comes from attending to a small portion only of the consequences that flow from the saving or the spending all the effects of either which are out of sight being out of mind <\s>
<s> there is in the one case a wearing out of tools a destruction of material and a quantity of food and clothing supplied to laborers which they destroy by use in the other case there is a consumption that is to say a destruction of wines equipages and furniture <\s>
<s> thus far the consequence to the national wealth has been much the same an equivalent quantity of it has been destroyed in both cases <\s>
<s> but in the spending this first stage is also the final stage that particular amount of the produce of labor has disappeared and there is nothing left while on the contrary the saving person during the whole time that the destruction was going on has had laborers at work repairing it who are ultimately found to have replaced with an increase the equivalent of what has been consumed <\s>
<s> almost all expenditure being carried on by means of money the money comes to be looked upon as the main feature in the transaction and since that does not perish but only changes hands people overlook the destruction which takes place in the case of unproductive expenditure <\s>
<s> the money being merely transferred they think the wealth also has only been handed over from the spendthrift to other people <\s>
<s> but this is simply confounding money with wealth <\s>
<s> the wealth which has been destroyed was not the money but the wines equipages and furniture which the money purchased and these having been destroyed without return society collectively is poorer by the amount <\s>
<s> in proportion as any class is improvident or luxurious the industry of the country takes the direction of producing luxuries for their use while not only the employment for productive laborers is diminished but the subsistence and instruments which are the means of such employment do actually exist in smaller quantity <\s>
<s> capital is kept up by perpetual reproduction as shown by the recovery of countries from devastation <\s>
<s> to return to our fundamental theorem <\s>
<s> everything which is produced is consumedboth what is saved and what is said to be spentand the former quite as rapidly as the latter <\s>
<s> all the ordinary forms of language tend to disguise this <\s>
<s> when people talk of the ancient wealth of a country of riches inherited from ancestors and similar expressions the idea suggested is that the riches so transmitted were produced long ago at the time when they are said to have been first acquired and that no portion of the capital of the country was produced this year except as much as may have been this year added to the total amount <\s>
<s> the fact is far otherwise <\s>

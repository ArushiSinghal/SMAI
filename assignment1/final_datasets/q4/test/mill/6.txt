<s> without some separation of employments very few things would be produced at all <\s>
<s> suppose a set of persons or a number of families all employed precisely in the same manner each family settled on a piece of its own land on which it grows by its labor the food required for its own sustenance and as there are no persons to buy any surplus produce where all are producers each family has to produce within itself whatever other articles it consumes <\s>
<s> in such circumstances if the soil was tolerably fertile and population did not tread too closely on the heels of subsistence there would be no doubt some kind of domestic manufactures clothing for the family might perhaps be spun and woven within it by the labor probably of the women a first step in the separation of employments ); and a dwelling of some sort would be erected and kept in repair by their united labor <\s>
<s> but beyond simple food precarious too from the variations of the seasons coarse clothing and very imperfect lodging it would be scarcely possible that the family should produce anything more <\s>
<s> suppose that a company of artificers provided with tools and with food sufficient to maintain them for a year arrive in the country and establish themselves in the midst of the population <\s>
<s> these new settlers occupy themselves in producing articles of use or ornament adapted to the taste of a simple people and before their food is exhausted they have produced these in considerable quantity and are ready to exchange them for more food <\s>

<s> they are thus incited to increase the productiveness of their industry <\s>
<s> the new settlers constitute what is called a market for surplus agricultural produce and their arrival has enriched the settlement not only by the manufactured articles which they produce but by the food which would not have been produced unless they had been there to consume it <\s>
<s> there is no inconsistency between this doctrine and the proposition we before maintained 115 that a market for commodities does not constitute employment for labor <\s>

<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>
<s> there are in a pound upward of four thousand pins of a middling size <\s>
<s> those ten persons therefore could make among them upward of forty eight thousand pins in a day <\s>
<s> each person therefore making a tenth part of forty eight thousand pins might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day <\s>
<s> but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day      3 <\s>
<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>
<s> the inventor of the power loom was a clergyman <\s>
<s> a farmer devised the application of the screw propeller <\s>
<s> a fancy goods shopkeeper is one of the most enterprising experimentalists in agriculture <\s>
<s> the most remarkable architectural design of our day has been furnished by a gardener <\s>
<s> the first person who supplied london with water was a goldsmith <\s>
<s> the first extensive maker of english roads was a blind man bred to no trade <\s>
<s> the father of english inland navigation was a duke and his engineer was a millwright <\s>
<s> the first great builder of iron bridges was a stone mason and the greatest railway engineer commenced his life as a colliery engineer    117 4 the greatest advantage next to the dexterity of the workmen derived from the minute division of labor which takes place in modern manufacturing industry is one not mentioned by adam smith but to which attention has been drawn by mr <\s>
<s> babbage the more economical distribution of labor by classing the work people according to their capacity <\s>
<s> different parts of the same series of operations require unequal degrees of skill and bodily strength and those who have skill enough for the most difficult or strength enough for the hardest parts of the labor are made much more useful by being employed solely in them the operations which everybody is capable of being left to those who are fit for no others <\s>
<s> the division of labor as all writers on the subject have remarked is limited by the extent of the market <\s>
<s> if by the separation of pin making into ten distinct employments forty eight thousand pins can be made in a day this separation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers is such as to require every day something like forty eight thousand pins <\s>
<s> if there is only a demand for twenty four thousand the division of labor can only be advantageously carried to the extent which will every day produce that smaller number <\s>
<s> the increase of the general riches of the world when accompanied with freedom of commercial intercourse improvements in navigation and inland communication by roads canals or railways tends to give increased productiveness to the labor of every nation in particular by enabling each locality to supply with its special products so much larger a market that a great extension of the division of labor in their production is an ordinary consequence <\s>
<s> the division of labor is also limited in many cases by the nature of the employment <\s>
<s> agriculture for example is not susceptible of so great a division of occupations as many branches of manufactures because its different operations can not possibly be simultaneous <\s>
<s> 5    in the examples given above the advantage obtained was derived from the mere fact of the separation of employments altogether independently of the mode in which the separated employments were distributed among the persons carrying them on as well as of the places in which they were conducted <\s>
<s> but a further gain arises when the employments are of a kind which in order to their effective performance call for special capacities in the workman or special natural resources in the scene of operation <\s>
<s> there would be a manifest waste of special power in compelling to a mere mechanical or routine pursuit a man who is fitted to excel in a professional career and similarly if a branch of industry were established on some site which offered greater facilities to an industry of another sort a waste analogous in character would be incurred <\s>

<s> without some separation of employments very few things would be produced at all <\s>
<s> suppose a set of persons or a number of families all employed precisely in the same manner each family settled on a piece of its own land on which it grows by its labor the food required for its own sustenance and as there are no persons to buy any surplus produce where all are producers each family has to produce within itself whatever other articles it consumes <\s>
<s> in such circumstances if the soil was tolerably fertile and population did not tread too closely on the heels of subsistence there would be no doubt some kind of domestic manufactures clothing for the family might perhaps be spun and woven within it by the labor probably of the women a first step in the separation of employments ); and a dwelling of some sort would be erected and kept in repair by their united labor <\s>
<s> but beyond simple food precarious too from the variations of the seasons coarse clothing and very imperfect lodging it would be scarcely possible that the family should produce anything more <\s>
<s> suppose that a company of artificers provided with tools and with food sufficient to maintain them for a year arrive in the country and establish themselves in the midst of the population <\s>
<s> these new settlers occupy themselves in producing articles of use or ornament adapted to the taste of a simple people and before their food is exhausted they have produced these in considerable quantity and are ready to exchange them for more food <\s>
<s> the economical position of the landed population is now most materially altered <\s>
<s> they have an opportunity given them of acquiring comforts and luxuries <\s>
<s> things which while they depended solely upon their own labor they never could have obtained because they could not have produced are now accessible to them if they can succeed in producing an additional quantity of food and necessaries <\s>
<s> they are thus incited to increase the productiveness of their industry <\s>
<s> the new settlers constitute what is called a market for surplus agricultural produce and their arrival has enriched the settlement not only by the manufactured articles which they produce but by the food which would not have been produced unless they had been there to consume it <\s>
<s> there is no inconsistency between this doctrine and the proposition we before maintained 115 that a market for commodities does not constitute employment for labor <\s>

<s> from these considerations it appears that a country will seldom have a productive agriculture unless it has a large town population or the only available substitute a large export trade in agricultural produce to supply a population elsewhere <\s>
<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>
<s> there are in a pound upward of four thousand pins of a middling size <\s>
<s> those ten persons therefore could make among them upward of forty eight thousand pins in a day <\s>
<s> each person therefore making a tenth part of forty eight thousand pins might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day <\s>
<s> but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day      3 <\s>
<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>
<s> the inventor of the power loom was a clergyman <\s>
<s> a farmer devised the application of the screw propeller <\s>
<s> a fancy goods shopkeeper is one of the most enterprising experimentalists in agriculture <\s>
<s> the most remarkable architectural design of our day has been furnished by a gardener <\s>
<s> the first person who supplied london with water was a goldsmith <\s>
<s> the first extensive maker of english roads was a blind man bred to no trade <\s>
<s> the father of english inland navigation was a duke and his engineer was a millwright <\s>
<s> the first great builder of iron bridges was a stone mason and the greatest railway engineer commenced his life as a colliery engineer    117 4 the greatest advantage next to the dexterity of the workmen derived from the minute division of labor which takes place in modern manufacturing industry is one not mentioned by adam smith but to which attention has been drawn by mr <\s>
<s> babbage the more economical distribution of labor by classing the work people according to their capacity <\s>
<s> different parts of the same series of operations require unequal degrees of skill and bodily strength and those who have skill enough for the most difficult or strength enough for the hardest parts of the labor are made much more useful by being employed solely in them the operations which everybody is capable of being left to those who are fit for no others <\s>
<s> the division of labor as all writers on the subject have remarked is limited by the extent of the market <\s>
<s> if by the separation of pin making into ten distinct employments forty eight thousand pins can be made in a day this separation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers is such as to require every day something like forty eight thousand pins <\s>
<s> if there is only a demand for twenty four thousand the division of labor can only be advantageously carried to the extent which will every day produce that smaller number <\s>
<s> the increase of the general riches of the world when accompanied with freedom of commercial intercourse improvements in navigation and inland communication by roads canals or railways tends to give increased productiveness to the labor of every nation in particular by enabling each locality to supply with its special products so much larger a market that a great extension of the division of labor in their production is an ordinary consequence <\s>
<s> the division of labor is also limited in many cases by the nature of the employment <\s>
<s> agriculture for example is not susceptible of so great a division of occupations as many branches of manufactures because its different operations can not possibly be simultaneous <\s>
<s> 5    in the examples given above the advantage obtained was derived from the mere fact of the separation of employments altogether independently of the mode in which the separated employments were distributed among the persons carrying them on as well as of the places in which they were conducted <\s>
<s> but a further gain arises when the employments are of a kind which in order to their effective performance call for special capacities in the workman or special natural resources in the scene of operation <\s>
<s> there would be a manifest waste of special power in compelling to a mere mechanical or routine pursuit a man who is fitted to excel in a professional career and similarly if a branch of industry were established on some site which offered greater facilities to an industry of another sort a waste analogous in character would be incurred <\s>
<s> fertility of soil is one of the principal <\s>
<s> the influence of climate is another advantage and consists in lessening the physical requirements of the producers <\s>
<s> in spinning very fine cotton thread englands natural climate gives in some parts of the country such advantages in proper moisture and electric conditions that the operation can be carried on out of doors while in the united states it is generally necessary to create an artificial atmosphere <\s>
<s> in ordinary spinning in our country more is accomplished when the wind is in one quarter than in another <\s>
<s> the dry northwest wind in new england reduces the amount of product while the dry northeast wind in england has a similar effect and it is said has practically driven the cotton spinners from manchester to oldham where the climate is more equably moist <\s>
<s> the full reasons for these facts are not yet ascertained <\s>
<s> experts in the woolen industry also explain that the quality and fiber of wool depend upon the soil and climate where the sheep are pastured <\s>
<s> when ohio sheep are transferred to texas in a few years their wool loses the distinctive quality it formerly possessed and takes on a new character belonging to the breeds of texas <\s>
<s> the wool produced by one set of climatic conditions is quite different from that of another set and is used by the manufacturers for different purposes <\s>
<s> in hot regions mankind can exist in comfort with less perfect housing less clothing fuel that absolute necessary of life in cold climates they can almost dispense with except for industrial uses <\s>
<s> they also require less aliment <\s>
<s> among natural advantages besides soil and climate must be mentioned abundance of mineral productions in convenient situations and capable of being worked with moderate labor <\s>
<s> such are the coal fields of great britain which do so much to compensate its inhabitants for the disadvantages of climate and the scarcely inferior resource possessed by this country and the united states in a copious supply of an easily reduced iron ore at no great depth below the earths surface and in close proximity to coal deposits available for working it <\s>
<s> but perhaps a greater advantage than all these is a maritime situation especially when accompanied with good natural harbors and next to it great navigable rivers <\s>
<s> these advantages consist indeed wholly in saving of cost of carriage <\s>
<s> but few who have not considered the subject have any adequate notion how great an extent of economical advantage this comprises <\s>

<s> from these considerations it appears that a country will seldom have a productive agriculture unless it has a large town population or the only available substitute a large export trade in agricultural produce to supply a population elsewhere <\s>
<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>
<s> there are in a pound upward of four thousand pins of a middling size <\s>
<s> those ten persons therefore could make among them upward of forty eight thousand pins in a day <\s>
<s> each person therefore making a tenth part of forty eight thousand pins might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day <\s>
<s> but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day      3 <\s>
<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>
<s> the inventor of the power loom was a clergyman <\s>
<s> a farmer devised the application of the screw propeller <\s>
<s> a fancy goods shopkeeper is one of the most enterprising experimentalists in agriculture <\s>
<s> the most remarkable architectural design of our day has been furnished by a gardener <\s>
<s> the first person who supplied london with water was a goldsmith <\s>
<s> the first extensive maker of english roads was a blind man bred to no trade <\s>
<s> the father of english inland navigation was a duke and his engineer was a millwright <\s>
<s> the first great builder of iron bridges was a stone mason and the greatest railway engineer commenced his life as a colliery engineer    117 4 the greatest advantage next to the dexterity of the workmen derived from the minute division of labor which takes place in modern manufacturing industry is one not mentioned by adam smith but to which attention has been drawn by mr <\s>
<s> babbage the more economical distribution of labor by classing the work people according to their capacity <\s>
<s> different parts of the same series of operations require unequal degrees of skill and bodily strength and those who have skill enough for the most difficult or strength enough for the hardest parts of the labor are made much more useful by being employed solely in them the operations which everybody is capable of being left to those who are fit for no others <\s>
<s> the division of labor as all writers on the subject have remarked is limited by the extent of the market <\s>
<s> if by the separation of pin making into ten distinct employments forty eight thousand pins can be made in a day this separation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers is such as to require every day something like forty eight thousand pins <\s>
<s> if there is only a demand for twenty four thousand the division of labor can only be advantageously carried to the extent which will every day produce that smaller number <\s>
<s> the increase of the general riches of the world when accompanied with freedom of commercial intercourse improvements in navigation and inland communication by roads canals or railways tends to give increased productiveness to the labor of every nation in particular by enabling each locality to supply with its special products so much larger a market that a great extension of the division of labor in their production is an ordinary consequence <\s>
<s> the division of labor is also limited in many cases by the nature of the employment <\s>
<s> agriculture for example is not susceptible of so great a division of occupations as many branches of manufactures because its different operations can not possibly be simultaneous <\s>
<s> 5    in the examples given above the advantage obtained was derived from the mere fact of the separation of employments altogether independently of the mode in which the separated employments were distributed among the persons carrying them on as well as of the places in which they were conducted <\s>
<s> but a further gain arises when the employments are of a kind which in order to their effective performance call for special capacities in the workman or special natural resources in the scene of operation <\s>
<s> there would be a manifest waste of special power in compelling to a mere mechanical or routine pursuit a man who is fitted to excel in a professional career and similarly if a branch of industry were established on some site which offered greater facilities to an industry of another sort a waste analogous in character would be incurred <\s>
<s> fertility of soil is one of the principal <\s>
<s> the influence of climate is another advantage and consists in lessening the physical requirements of the producers <\s>
<s> in spinning very fine cotton thread englands natural climate gives in some parts of the country such advantages in proper moisture and electric conditions that the operation can be carried on out of doors while in the united states it is generally necessary to create an artificial atmosphere <\s>
<s> in ordinary spinning in our country more is accomplished when the wind is in one quarter than in another <\s>
<s> the dry northwest wind in new england reduces the amount of product while the dry northeast wind in england has a similar effect and it is said has practically driven the cotton spinners from manchester to oldham where the climate is more equably moist <\s>
<s> the full reasons for these facts are not yet ascertained <\s>
<s> experts in the woolen industry also explain that the quality and fiber of wool depend upon the soil and climate where the sheep are pastured <\s>
<s> when ohio sheep are transferred to texas in a few years their wool loses the distinctive quality it formerly possessed and takes on a new character belonging to the breeds of texas <\s>
<s> the wool produced by one set of climatic conditions is quite different from that of another set and is used by the manufacturers for different purposes <\s>
<s> in hot regions mankind can exist in comfort with less perfect housing less clothing fuel that absolute necessary of life in cold climates they can almost dispense with except for industrial uses <\s>
<s> they also require less aliment <\s>
<s> among natural advantages besides soil and climate must be mentioned abundance of mineral productions in convenient situations and capable of being worked with moderate labor <\s>
<s> such are the coal fields of great britain which do so much to compensate its inhabitants for the disadvantages of climate and the scarcely inferior resource possessed by this country and the united states in a copious supply of an easily reduced iron ore at no great depth below the earths surface and in close proximity to coal deposits available for working it <\s>
<s> but perhaps a greater advantage than all these is a maritime situation especially when accompanied with good natural harbors and next to it great navigable rivers <\s>
<s> these advantages consist indeed wholly in saving of cost of carriage <\s>
<s> but few who have not considered the subject have any adequate notion how great an extent of economical advantage this comprises <\s>
<s> as the second of the general causes of superior productiveness we may rank the greater energy of labor <\s>
<s> by this is not to be understood occasional but regular and habitual energy <\s>
<s> the third element which determines the productiveness of the labor of a community is the skill and knowledge therein existing whether it be the skill and knowledge of the laborers themselves or of those who direct their labor <\s>
<s> that the productiveness of the labor of a people is limited by their knowledge of the arts of life is self evident and that any progress in those arts any improved application of the objects or powers of nature to industrial uses enables the same quantity and intensity of labor to raise a greater produce <\s>
<s> one principal department of these improvements consists in the invention and use of tools and machinery 114 the deficiency of practical good sense which renders the majority of the laboring class such bad calculatorswhich makes for instance their domestic economy so improvident lax and irregularmust disqualify them for any but a low grade of intelligent labor and render their industry far less productive than with equal energy it otherwise might be <\s>
<s> the moral qualities of the laborers are fully as important to the efficiency and worth of their labor as the intellectual <\s>
<s> independently of the effects of intemperance upon their bodily and mental faculties and of flighty unsteady habits upon the energy and continuity of their work points so easily understood as not to require being insisted upon it is well worthy of meditation how much of the aggregate effect of their labor depends on their trustworthiness <\s>
<s> among the secondary causes which determine the productiveness of productive agents the most important is security <\s>

<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>

<s> but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day      3 <\s>
<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>
<s> the inventor of the power loom was a clergyman <\s>
<s> a farmer devised the application of the screw propeller <\s>
<s> a fancy goods shopkeeper is one of the most enterprising experimentalists in agriculture <\s>
<s> the most remarkable architectural design of our day has been furnished by a gardener <\s>
<s> the first person who supplied london with water was a goldsmith <\s>
<s> the first extensive maker of english roads was a blind man bred to no trade <\s>
<s> the father of english inland navigation was a duke and his engineer was a millwright <\s>
<s> the first great builder of iron bridges was a stone mason and the greatest railway engineer commenced his life as a colliery engineer    117 4 the greatest advantage next to the dexterity of the workmen derived from the minute division of labor which takes place in modern manufacturing industry is one not mentioned by adam smith but to which attention has been drawn by mr <\s>
<s> babbage the more economical distribution of labor by classing the work people according to their capacity <\s>
<s> different parts of the same series of operations require unequal degrees of skill and bodily strength and those who have skill enough for the most difficult or strength enough for the hardest parts of the labor are made much more useful by being employed solely in them the operations which everybody is capable of being left to those who are fit for no others <\s>
<s> the division of labor as all writers on the subject have remarked is limited by the extent of the market <\s>
<s> if by the separation of pin making into ten distinct employments forty eight thousand pins can be made in a day this separation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers is such as to require every day something like forty eight thousand pins <\s>
<s> if there is only a demand for twenty four thousand the division of labor can only be advantageously carried to the extent which will every day produce that smaller number <\s>
<s> the increase of the general riches of the world when accompanied with freedom of commercial intercourse improvements in navigation and inland communication by roads canals or railways tends to give increased productiveness to the labor of every nation in particular by enabling each locality to supply with its special products so much larger a market that a great extension of the division of labor in their production is an ordinary consequence <\s>
<s> the division of labor is also limited in many cases by the nature of the employment <\s>
<s> agriculture for example is not susceptible of so great a division of occupations as many branches of manufactures because its different operations can not possibly be simultaneous <\s>
<s> 5    in the examples given above the advantage obtained was derived from the mere fact of the separation of employments altogether independently of the mode in which the separated employments were distributed among the persons carrying them on as well as of the places in which they were conducted <\s>
<s> but a further gain arises when the employments are of a kind which in order to their effective performance call for special capacities in the workman or special natural resources in the scene of operation <\s>
<s> there would be a manifest waste of special power in compelling to a mere mechanical or routine pursuit a man who is fitted to excel in a professional career and similarly if a branch of industry were established on some site which offered greater facilities to an industry of another sort a waste analogous in character would be incurred <\s>
<s> fertility of soil is one of the principal <\s>
<s> the influence of climate is another advantage and consists in lessening the physical requirements of the producers <\s>
<s> in spinning very fine cotton thread englands natural climate gives in some parts of the country such advantages in proper moisture and electric conditions that the operation can be carried on out of doors while in the united states it is generally necessary to create an artificial atmosphere <\s>
<s> in ordinary spinning in our country more is accomplished when the wind is in one quarter than in another <\s>
<s> the dry northwest wind in new england reduces the amount of product while the dry northeast wind in england has a similar effect and it is said has practically driven the cotton spinners from manchester to oldham where the climate is more equably moist <\s>
<s> the full reasons for these facts are not yet ascertained <\s>
<s> experts in the woolen industry also explain that the quality and fiber of wool depend upon the soil and climate where the sheep are pastured <\s>
<s> when ohio sheep are transferred to texas in a few years their wool loses the distinctive quality it formerly possessed and takes on a new character belonging to the breeds of texas <\s>
<s> the wool produced by one set of climatic conditions is quite different from that of another set and is used by the manufacturers for different purposes <\s>
<s> in hot regions mankind can exist in comfort with less perfect housing less clothing fuel that absolute necessary of life in cold climates they can almost dispense with except for industrial uses <\s>
<s> they also require less aliment <\s>
<s> among natural advantages besides soil and climate must be mentioned abundance of mineral productions in convenient situations and capable of being worked with moderate labor <\s>
<s> such are the coal fields of great britain which do so much to compensate its inhabitants for the disadvantages of climate and the scarcely inferior resource possessed by this country and the united states in a copious supply of an easily reduced iron ore at no great depth below the earths surface and in close proximity to coal deposits available for working it <\s>
<s> but perhaps a greater advantage than all these is a maritime situation especially when accompanied with good natural harbors and next to it great navigable rivers <\s>
<s> these advantages consist indeed wholly in saving of cost of carriage <\s>
<s> but few who have not considered the subject have any adequate notion how great an extent of economical advantage this comprises <\s>
<s> as the second of the general causes of superior productiveness we may rank the greater energy of labor <\s>
<s> by this is not to be understood occasional but regular and habitual energy <\s>
<s> the third element which determines the productiveness of the labor of a community is the skill and knowledge therein existing whether it be the skill and knowledge of the laborers themselves or of those who direct their labor <\s>
<s> that the productiveness of the labor of a people is limited by their knowledge of the arts of life is self evident and that any progress in those arts any improved application of the objects or powers of nature to industrial uses enables the same quantity and intensity of labor to raise a greater produce <\s>
<s> one principal department of these improvements consists in the invention and use of tools and machinery 114 the deficiency of practical good sense which renders the majority of the laboring class such bad calculatorswhich makes for instance their domestic economy so improvident lax and irregularmust disqualify them for any but a low grade of intelligent labor and render their industry far less productive than with equal energy it otherwise might be <\s>
<s> the moral qualities of the laborers are fully as important to the efficiency and worth of their labor as the intellectual <\s>
<s> independently of the effects of intemperance upon their bodily and mental faculties and of flighty unsteady habits upon the energy and continuity of their work points so easily understood as not to require being insisted upon it is well worthy of meditation how much of the aggregate effect of their labor depends on their trustworthiness <\s>
<s> among the secondary causes which determine the productiveness of productive agents the most important is security <\s>
<s> by security i mean the completeness of the protection which society affords to its members <\s>
<s> combination and division of labor increase productiveness <\s>
<s> in the enumeration of the circumstances which promote the productiveness of labor we have left one untouched which is co operation or the combined action of numbers <\s>
<s> of this great aid to production a single department known by the name of division of labor has engaged a large share of the attention of political economists most deservedly indeed but to the exclusion of other cases and exemplifications of the same comprehensive law <\s>
<s> in the lifting of heavy weights for example in the felling of trees in the sawing of timber in the gathering of much hay or corn during a short period of fine weather in draining a large extent of land during the short season when such a work may be properly conducted in the pulling of ropes on board ship in the rowing of large boats in some mining operations in the erection of a scaffolding for building and in the breaking of stones for the repair of a road so that the whole of the road shall always be kept in good order in all these simple operations and thousands more it is absolutely necessary that many persons should work together at the same time in the same place and in the same way <\s>
<s> but in the present state of society the breeding and feeding of sheep is the occupation of one set of people dressing the wool to prepare it for the spinner is that of another spinning it into thread of a third weaving the thread into broadcloth of a fourth dyeing the cloth of a fifth making it into a coat of a sixth without counting the multitude of carriers merchants factors and retailers put in requisition at the successive stages of this progress <\s>
<s> without some separation of employments very few things would be produced at all <\s>
<s> suppose a set of persons or a number of families all employed precisely in the same manner each family settled on a piece of its own land on which it grows by its labor the food required for its own sustenance and as there are no persons to buy any surplus produce where all are producers each family has to produce within itself whatever other articles it consumes <\s>

<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>

<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>

<s> babbage the more economical distribution of labor by classing the work people according to their capacity <\s>
<s> different parts of the same series of operations require unequal degrees of skill and bodily strength and those who have skill enough for the most difficult or strength enough for the hardest parts of the labor are made much more useful by being employed solely in them the operations which everybody is capable of being left to those who are fit for no others <\s>
<s> the division of labor as all writers on the subject have remarked is limited by the extent of the market <\s>
<s> if by the separation of pin making into ten distinct employments forty eight thousand pins can be made in a day this separation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers is such as to require every day something like forty eight thousand pins <\s>
<s> if there is only a demand for twenty four thousand the division of labor can only be advantageously carried to the extent which will every day produce that smaller number <\s>
<s> the increase of the general riches of the world when accompanied with freedom of commercial intercourse improvements in navigation and inland communication by roads canals or railways tends to give increased productiveness to the labor of every nation in particular by enabling each locality to supply with its special products so much larger a market that a great extension of the division of labor in their production is an ordinary consequence <\s>
<s> the division of labor is also limited in many cases by the nature of the employment <\s>
<s> agriculture for example is not susceptible of so great a division of occupations as many branches of manufactures because its different operations can not possibly be simultaneous <\s>
<s> 5    in the examples given above the advantage obtained was derived from the mere fact of the separation of employments altogether independently of the mode in which the separated employments were distributed among the persons carrying them on as well as of the places in which they were conducted <\s>

<s> fertility of soil is one of the principal <\s>

<s> in hot regions mankind can exist in comfort with less perfect housing less clothing fuel that absolute necessary of life in cold climates they can almost dispense with except for industrial uses <\s>

<s> among natural advantages besides soil and climate must be mentioned abundance of mineral productions in convenient situations and capable of being worked with moderate labor <\s>
<s> such are the coal fields of great britain which do so much to compensate its inhabitants for the disadvantages of climate and the scarcely inferior resource possessed by this country and the united states in a copious supply of an easily reduced iron ore at no great depth below the earths surface and in close proximity to coal deposits available for working it <\s>

<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>
<s> the inventor of the power loom was a clergyman <\s>
<s> a farmer devised the application of the screw propeller <\s>
<s> a fancy goods shopkeeper is one of the most enterprising experimentalists in agriculture <\s>
<s> the most remarkable architectural design of our day has been furnished by a gardener <\s>
<s> the first person who supplied london with water was a goldsmith <\s>
<s> the first extensive maker of english roads was a blind man bred to no trade <\s>
<s> the father of english inland navigation was a duke and his engineer was a millwright <\s>
<s> the first great builder of iron bridges was a stone mason and the greatest railway engineer commenced his life as a colliery engineer    117 4 the greatest advantage next to the dexterity of the workmen derived from the minute division of labor which takes place in modern manufacturing industry is one not mentioned by adam smith but to which attention has been drawn by mr <\s>
<s> babbage the more economical distribution of labor by classing the work people according to their capacity <\s>
<s> different parts of the same series of operations require unequal degrees of skill and bodily strength and those who have skill enough for the most difficult or strength enough for the hardest parts of the labor are made much more useful by being employed solely in them the operations which everybody is capable of being left to those who are fit for no others <\s>
<s> the division of labor as all writers on the subject have remarked is limited by the extent of the market <\s>
<s> if by the separation of pin making into ten distinct employments forty eight thousand pins can be made in a day this separation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers is such as to require every day something like forty eight thousand pins <\s>
<s> if there is only a demand for twenty four thousand the division of labor can only be advantageously carried to the extent which will every day produce that smaller number <\s>
<s> the increase of the general riches of the world when accompanied with freedom of commercial intercourse improvements in navigation and inland communication by roads canals or railways tends to give increased productiveness to the labor of every nation in particular by enabling each locality to supply with its special products so much larger a market that a great extension of the division of labor in their production is an ordinary consequence <\s>
<s> the division of labor is also limited in many cases by the nature of the employment <\s>
<s> agriculture for example is not susceptible of so great a division of occupations as many branches of manufactures because its different operations can not possibly be simultaneous <\s>
<s> 5    in the examples given above the advantage obtained was derived from the mere fact of the separation of employments altogether independently of the mode in which the separated employments were distributed among the persons carrying them on as well as of the places in which they were conducted <\s>
<s> but a further gain arises when the employments are of a kind which in order to their effective performance call for special capacities in the workman or special natural resources in the scene of operation <\s>
<s> there would be a manifest waste of special power in compelling to a mere mechanical or routine pursuit a man who is fitted to excel in a professional career and similarly if a branch of industry were established on some site which offered greater facilities to an industry of another sort a waste analogous in character would be incurred <\s>
<s> fertility of soil is one of the principal <\s>
<s> the influence of climate is another advantage and consists in lessening the physical requirements of the producers <\s>
<s> in spinning very fine cotton thread englands natural climate gives in some parts of the country such advantages in proper moisture and electric conditions that the operation can be carried on out of doors while in the united states it is generally necessary to create an artificial atmosphere <\s>
<s> in ordinary spinning in our country more is accomplished when the wind is in one quarter than in another <\s>
<s> the dry northwest wind in new england reduces the amount of product while the dry northeast wind in england has a similar effect and it is said has practically driven the cotton spinners from manchester to oldham where the climate is more equably moist <\s>
<s> the full reasons for these facts are not yet ascertained <\s>
<s> experts in the woolen industry also explain that the quality and fiber of wool depend upon the soil and climate where the sheep are pastured <\s>
<s> when ohio sheep are transferred to texas in a few years their wool loses the distinctive quality it formerly possessed and takes on a new character belonging to the breeds of texas <\s>
<s> the wool produced by one set of climatic conditions is quite different from that of another set and is used by the manufacturers for different purposes <\s>
<s> in hot regions mankind can exist in comfort with less perfect housing less clothing fuel that absolute necessary of life in cold climates they can almost dispense with except for industrial uses <\s>
<s> they also require less aliment <\s>
<s> among natural advantages besides soil and climate must be mentioned abundance of mineral productions in convenient situations and capable of being worked with moderate labor <\s>
<s> such are the coal fields of great britain which do so much to compensate its inhabitants for the disadvantages of climate and the scarcely inferior resource possessed by this country and the united states in a copious supply of an easily reduced iron ore at no great depth below the earths surface and in close proximity to coal deposits available for working it <\s>
<s> but perhaps a greater advantage than all these is a maritime situation especially when accompanied with good natural harbors and next to it great navigable rivers <\s>
<s> these advantages consist indeed wholly in saving of cost of carriage <\s>
<s> but few who have not considered the subject have any adequate notion how great an extent of economical advantage this comprises <\s>
<s> as the second of the general causes of superior productiveness we may rank the greater energy of labor <\s>
<s> by this is not to be understood occasional but regular and habitual energy <\s>
<s> the third element which determines the productiveness of the labor of a community is the skill and knowledge therein existing whether it be the skill and knowledge of the laborers themselves or of those who direct their labor <\s>
<s> that the productiveness of the labor of a people is limited by their knowledge of the arts of life is self evident and that any progress in those arts any improved application of the objects or powers of nature to industrial uses enables the same quantity and intensity of labor to raise a greater produce <\s>
<s> one principal department of these improvements consists in the invention and use of tools and machinery 114 the deficiency of practical good sense which renders the majority of the laboring class such bad calculatorswhich makes for instance their domestic economy so improvident lax and irregularmust disqualify them for any but a low grade of intelligent labor and render their industry far less productive than with equal energy it otherwise might be <\s>
<s> the moral qualities of the laborers are fully as important to the efficiency and worth of their labor as the intellectual <\s>
<s> independently of the effects of intemperance upon their bodily and mental faculties and of flighty unsteady habits upon the energy and continuity of their work points so easily understood as not to require being insisted upon it is well worthy of meditation how much of the aggregate effect of their labor depends on their trustworthiness <\s>
<s> among the secondary causes which determine the productiveness of productive agents the most important is security <\s>
<s> by security i mean the completeness of the protection which society affords to its members <\s>
<s> combination and division of labor increase productiveness <\s>
<s> in the enumeration of the circumstances which promote the productiveness of labor we have left one untouched which is co operation or the combined action of numbers <\s>
<s> of this great aid to production a single department known by the name of division of labor has engaged a large share of the attention of political economists most deservedly indeed but to the exclusion of other cases and exemplifications of the same comprehensive law <\s>
<s> in the lifting of heavy weights for example in the felling of trees in the sawing of timber in the gathering of much hay or corn during a short period of fine weather in draining a large extent of land during the short season when such a work may be properly conducted in the pulling of ropes on board ship in the rowing of large boats in some mining operations in the erection of a scaffolding for building and in the breaking of stones for the repair of a road so that the whole of the road shall always be kept in good order in all these simple operations and thousands more it is absolutely necessary that many persons should work together at the same time in the same place and in the same way <\s>
<s> but in the present state of society the breeding and feeding of sheep is the occupation of one set of people dressing the wool to prepare it for the spinner is that of another spinning it into thread of a third weaving the thread into broadcloth of a fourth dyeing the cloth of a fifth making it into a coat of a sixth without counting the multitude of carriers merchants factors and retailers put in requisition at the successive stages of this progress <\s>
<s> without some separation of employments very few things would be produced at all <\s>
<s> suppose a set of persons or a number of families all employed precisely in the same manner each family settled on a piece of its own land on which it grows by its labor the food required for its own sustenance and as there are no persons to buy any surplus produce where all are producers each family has to produce within itself whatever other articles it consumes <\s>
<s> in such circumstances if the soil was tolerably fertile and population did not tread too closely on the heels of subsistence there would be no doubt some kind of domestic manufactures clothing for the family might perhaps be spun and woven within it by the labor probably of the women a first step in the separation of employments ); and a dwelling of some sort would be erected and kept in repair by their united labor <\s>
<s> but beyond simple food precarious too from the variations of the seasons coarse clothing and very imperfect lodging it would be scarcely possible that the family should produce anything more <\s>
<s> suppose that a company of artificers provided with tools and with food sufficient to maintain them for a year arrive in the country and establish themselves in the midst of the population <\s>
<s> these new settlers occupy themselves in producing articles of use or ornament adapted to the taste of a simple people and before their food is exhausted they have produced these in considerable quantity and are ready to exchange them for more food <\s>
<s> the economical position of the landed population is now most materially altered <\s>
<s> they have an opportunity given them of acquiring comforts and luxuries <\s>
<s> things which while they depended solely upon their own labor they never could have obtained because they could not have produced are now accessible to them if they can succeed in producing an additional quantity of food and necessaries <\s>
<s> they are thus incited to increase the productiveness of their industry <\s>
<s> the new settlers constitute what is called a market for surplus agricultural produce and their arrival has enriched the settlement not only by the manufactured articles which they produce but by the food which would not have been produced unless they had been there to consume it <\s>
<s> there is no inconsistency between this doctrine and the proposition we before maintained 115 that a market for commodities does not constitute employment for labor <\s>
<s> the labor of the agriculturists was already provided with employment they are not indebted to the demand of the new comers for being able to maintain themselves <\s>
<s> what that demand does for them is to call their labor into increased vigor and efficiency to stimulate them by new motives to new exertions <\s>
<s> from these considerations it appears that a country will seldom have a productive agriculture unless it has a large town population or the only available substitute a large export trade in agricultural produce to supply a population elsewhere <\s>
<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>
<s> there are in a pound upward of four thousand pins of a middling size <\s>
<s> those ten persons therefore could make among them upward of forty eight thousand pins in a day <\s>
<s> each person therefore making a tenth part of forty eight thousand pins might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day <\s>
<s> but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day      3 <\s>

<s> without some separation of employments very few things would be produced at all <\s>
<s> suppose a set of persons or a number of families all employed precisely in the same manner each family settled on a piece of its own land on which it grows by its labor the food required for its own sustenance and as there are no persons to buy any surplus produce where all are producers each family has to produce within itself whatever other articles it consumes <\s>
<s> in such circumstances if the soil was tolerably fertile and population did not tread too closely on the heels of subsistence there would be no doubt some kind of domestic manufactures clothing for the family might perhaps be spun and woven within it by the labor probably of the women a first step in the separation of employments ); and a dwelling of some sort would be erected and kept in repair by their united labor <\s>
<s> but beyond simple food precarious too from the variations of the seasons coarse clothing and very imperfect lodging it would be scarcely possible that the family should produce anything more <\s>
<s> suppose that a company of artificers provided with tools and with food sufficient to maintain them for a year arrive in the country and establish themselves in the midst of the population <\s>
<s> these new settlers occupy themselves in producing articles of use or ornament adapted to the taste of a simple people and before their food is exhausted they have produced these in considerable quantity and are ready to exchange them for more food <\s>
<s> the economical position of the landed population is now most materially altered <\s>
<s> they have an opportunity given them of acquiring comforts and luxuries <\s>
<s> things which while they depended solely upon their own labor they never could have obtained because they could not have produced are now accessible to them if they can succeed in producing an additional quantity of food and necessaries <\s>
<s> they are thus incited to increase the productiveness of their industry <\s>
<s> the new settlers constitute what is called a market for surplus agricultural produce and their arrival has enriched the settlement not only by the manufactured articles which they produce but by the food which would not have been produced unless they had been there to consume it <\s>
<s> there is no inconsistency between this doctrine and the proposition we before maintained 115 that a market for commodities does not constitute employment for labor <\s>
<s> the labor of the agriculturists was already provided with employment they are not indebted to the demand of the new comers for being able to maintain themselves <\s>

<s> from these considerations it appears that a country will seldom have a productive agriculture unless it has a large town population or the only available substitute a large export trade in agricultural produce to supply a population elsewhere <\s>
<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>

<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>

<s> without some separation of employments very few things would be produced at all <\s>
<s> suppose a set of persons or a number of families all employed precisely in the same manner each family settled on a piece of its own land on which it grows by its labor the food required for its own sustenance and as there are no persons to buy any surplus produce where all are producers each family has to produce within itself whatever other articles it consumes <\s>
<s> in such circumstances if the soil was tolerably fertile and population did not tread too closely on the heels of subsistence there would be no doubt some kind of domestic manufactures clothing for the family might perhaps be spun and woven within it by the labor probably of the women a first step in the separation of employments ); and a dwelling of some sort would be erected and kept in repair by their united labor <\s>
<s> but beyond simple food precarious too from the variations of the seasons coarse clothing and very imperfect lodging it would be scarcely possible that the family should produce anything more <\s>
<s> suppose that a company of artificers provided with tools and with food sufficient to maintain them for a year arrive in the country and establish themselves in the midst of the population <\s>
<s> these new settlers occupy themselves in producing articles of use or ornament adapted to the taste of a simple people and before their food is exhausted they have produced these in considerable quantity and are ready to exchange them for more food <\s>
<s> the economical position of the landed population is now most materially altered <\s>
<s> they have an opportunity given them of acquiring comforts and luxuries <\s>
<s> things which while they depended solely upon their own labor they never could have obtained because they could not have produced are now accessible to them if they can succeed in producing an additional quantity of food and necessaries <\s>
<s> they are thus incited to increase the productiveness of their industry <\s>
<s> the new settlers constitute what is called a market for surplus agricultural produce and their arrival has enriched the settlement not only by the manufactured articles which they produce but by the food which would not have been produced unless they had been there to consume it <\s>
<s> there is no inconsistency between this doctrine and the proposition we before maintained 115 that a market for commodities does not constitute employment for labor <\s>
<s> the labor of the agriculturists was already provided with employment they are not indebted to the demand of the new comers for being able to maintain themselves <\s>
<s> what that demand does for them is to call their labor into increased vigor and efficiency to stimulate them by new motives to new exertions <\s>
<s> from these considerations it appears that a country will seldom have a productive agriculture unless it has a large town population or the only available substitute a large export trade in agricultural produce to supply a population elsewhere <\s>
<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>
<s> there are in a pound upward of four thousand pins of a middling size <\s>
<s> those ten persons therefore could make among them upward of forty eight thousand pins in a day <\s>
<s> each person therefore making a tenth part of forty eight thousand pins might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day <\s>
<s> but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day      3 <\s>
<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>
<s> the inventor of the power loom was a clergyman <\s>

<s> but beyond simple food precarious too from the variations of the seasons coarse clothing and very imperfect lodging it would be scarcely possible that the family should produce anything more <\s>

<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>
<s> there are in a pound upward of four thousand pins of a middling size <\s>
<s> those ten persons therefore could make among them upward of forty eight thousand pins in a day <\s>
<s> each person therefore making a tenth part of forty eight thousand pins might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day <\s>
<s> but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day      3 <\s>
<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>
<s> the inventor of the power loom was a clergyman <\s>
<s> a farmer devised the application of the screw propeller <\s>
<s> a fancy goods shopkeeper is one of the most enterprising experimentalists in agriculture <\s>
<s> the most remarkable architectural design of our day has been furnished by a gardener <\s>
<s> the first person who supplied london with water was a goldsmith <\s>
<s> the first extensive maker of english roads was a blind man bred to no trade <\s>
<s> the father of english inland navigation was a duke and his engineer was a millwright <\s>
<s> the first great builder of iron bridges was a stone mason and the greatest railway engineer commenced his life as a colliery engineer    117 4 the greatest advantage next to the dexterity of the workmen derived from the minute division of labor which takes place in modern manufacturing industry is one not mentioned by adam smith but to which attention has been drawn by mr <\s>
<s> babbage the more economical distribution of labor by classing the work people according to their capacity <\s>
<s> different parts of the same series of operations require unequal degrees of skill and bodily strength and those who have skill enough for the most difficult or strength enough for the hardest parts of the labor are made much more useful by being employed solely in them the operations which everybody is capable of being left to those who are fit for no others <\s>
<s> the division of labor as all writers on the subject have remarked is limited by the extent of the market <\s>
<s> if by the separation of pin making into ten distinct employments forty eight thousand pins can be made in a day this separation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers is such as to require every day something like forty eight thousand pins <\s>
<s> if there is only a demand for twenty four thousand the division of labor can only be advantageously carried to the extent which will every day produce that smaller number <\s>
<s> the increase of the general riches of the world when accompanied with freedom of commercial intercourse improvements in navigation and inland communication by roads canals or railways tends to give increased productiveness to the labor of every nation in particular by enabling each locality to supply with its special products so much larger a market that a great extension of the division of labor in their production is an ordinary consequence <\s>
<s> the division of labor is also limited in many cases by the nature of the employment <\s>
<s> agriculture for example is not susceptible of so great a division of occupations as many branches of manufactures because its different operations can not possibly be simultaneous <\s>

<s> without some separation of employments very few things would be produced at all <\s>
<s> suppose a set of persons or a number of families all employed precisely in the same manner each family settled on a piece of its own land on which it grows by its labor the food required for its own sustenance and as there are no persons to buy any surplus produce where all are producers each family has to produce within itself whatever other articles it consumes <\s>
<s> in such circumstances if the soil was tolerably fertile and population did not tread too closely on the heels of subsistence there would be no doubt some kind of domestic manufactures clothing for the family might perhaps be spun and woven within it by the labor probably of the women a first step in the separation of employments ); and a dwelling of some sort would be erected and kept in repair by their united labor <\s>
<s> but beyond simple food precarious too from the variations of the seasons coarse clothing and very imperfect lodging it would be scarcely possible that the family should produce anything more <\s>

<s> these new settlers occupy themselves in producing articles of use or ornament adapted to the taste of a simple people and before their food is exhausted they have produced these in considerable quantity and are ready to exchange them for more food <\s>

<s> they have an opportunity given them of acquiring comforts and luxuries <\s>
<s> things which while they depended solely upon their own labor they never could have obtained because they could not have produced are now accessible to them if they can succeed in producing an additional quantity of food and necessaries <\s>
<s> they are thus incited to increase the productiveness of their industry <\s>
<s> the new settlers constitute what is called a market for surplus agricultural produce and their arrival has enriched the settlement not only by the manufactured articles which they produce but by the food which would not have been produced unless they had been there to consume it <\s>
<s> there is no inconsistency between this doctrine and the proposition we before maintained 115 that a market for commodities does not constitute employment for labor <\s>

<s> from these considerations it appears that a country will seldom have a productive agriculture unless it has a large town population or the only available substitute a large export trade in agricultural produce to supply a population elsewhere <\s>
<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>
<s> there are in a pound upward of four thousand pins of a middling size <\s>
<s> those ten persons therefore could make among them upward of forty eight thousand pins in a day <\s>
<s> each person therefore making a tenth part of forty eight thousand pins might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day <\s>
<s> but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day      3 <\s>
<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>
<s> the inventor of the power loom was a clergyman <\s>
<s> a farmer devised the application of the screw propeller <\s>
<s> a fancy goods shopkeeper is one of the most enterprising experimentalists in agriculture <\s>
<s> the most remarkable architectural design of our day has been furnished by a gardener <\s>
<s> the first person who supplied london with water was a goldsmith <\s>
<s> the first extensive maker of english roads was a blind man bred to no trade <\s>
<s> the father of english inland navigation was a duke and his engineer was a millwright <\s>
<s> the first great builder of iron bridges was a stone mason and the greatest railway engineer commenced his life as a colliery engineer    117 4 the greatest advantage next to the dexterity of the workmen derived from the minute division of labor which takes place in modern manufacturing industry is one not mentioned by adam smith but to which attention has been drawn by mr <\s>
<s> babbage the more economical distribution of labor by classing the work people according to their capacity <\s>
<s> different parts of the same series of operations require unequal degrees of skill and bodily strength and those who have skill enough for the most difficult or strength enough for the hardest parts of the labor are made much more useful by being employed solely in them the operations which everybody is capable of being left to those who are fit for no others <\s>
<s> the division of labor as all writers on the subject have remarked is limited by the extent of the market <\s>
<s> if by the separation of pin making into ten distinct employments forty eight thousand pins can be made in a day this separation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers is such as to require every day something like forty eight thousand pins <\s>
<s> if there is only a demand for twenty four thousand the division of labor can only be advantageously carried to the extent which will every day produce that smaller number <\s>
<s> the increase of the general riches of the world when accompanied with freedom of commercial intercourse improvements in navigation and inland communication by roads canals or railways tends to give increased productiveness to the labor of every nation in particular by enabling each locality to supply with its special products so much larger a market that a great extension of the division of labor in their production is an ordinary consequence <\s>
<s> the division of labor is also limited in many cases by the nature of the employment <\s>
<s> agriculture for example is not susceptible of so great a division of occupations as many branches of manufactures because its different operations can not possibly be simultaneous <\s>
<s> 5    in the examples given above the advantage obtained was derived from the mere fact of the separation of employments altogether independently of the mode in which the separated employments were distributed among the persons carrying them on as well as of the places in which they were conducted <\s>
<s> but a further gain arises when the employments are of a kind which in order to their effective performance call for special capacities in the workman or special natural resources in the scene of operation <\s>
<s> there would be a manifest waste of special power in compelling to a mere mechanical or routine pursuit a man who is fitted to excel in a professional career and similarly if a branch of industry were established on some site which offered greater facilities to an industry of another sort a waste analogous in character would be incurred <\s>
<s> fertility of soil is one of the principal <\s>
<s> the influence of climate is another advantage and consists in lessening the physical requirements of the producers <\s>
<s> in spinning very fine cotton thread englands natural climate gives in some parts of the country such advantages in proper moisture and electric conditions that the operation can be carried on out of doors while in the united states it is generally necessary to create an artificial atmosphere <\s>
<s> in ordinary spinning in our country more is accomplished when the wind is in one quarter than in another <\s>
<s> the dry northwest wind in new england reduces the amount of product while the dry northeast wind in england has a similar effect and it is said has practically driven the cotton spinners from manchester to oldham where the climate is more equably moist <\s>
<s> the full reasons for these facts are not yet ascertained <\s>
<s> experts in the woolen industry also explain that the quality and fiber of wool depend upon the soil and climate where the sheep are pastured <\s>
<s> when ohio sheep are transferred to texas in a few years their wool loses the distinctive quality it formerly possessed and takes on a new character belonging to the breeds of texas <\s>
<s> the wool produced by one set of climatic conditions is quite different from that of another set and is used by the manufacturers for different purposes <\s>
<s> in hot regions mankind can exist in comfort with less perfect housing less clothing fuel that absolute necessary of life in cold climates they can almost dispense with except for industrial uses <\s>

<s> but beyond simple food precarious too from the variations of the seasons coarse clothing and very imperfect lodging it would be scarcely possible that the family should produce anything more <\s>

<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>
<s> there are in a pound upward of four thousand pins of a middling size <\s>
<s> those ten persons therefore could make among them upward of forty eight thousand pins in a day <\s>
<s> each person therefore making a tenth part of forty eight thousand pins might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day <\s>
<s> but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day      3 <\s>
<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>
<s> the inventor of the power loom was a clergyman <\s>
<s> a farmer devised the application of the screw propeller <\s>
<s> a fancy goods shopkeeper is one of the most enterprising experimentalists in agriculture <\s>
<s> the most remarkable architectural design of our day has been furnished by a gardener <\s>
<s> the first person who supplied london with water was a goldsmith <\s>
<s> the first extensive maker of english roads was a blind man bred to no trade <\s>
<s> the father of english inland navigation was a duke and his engineer was a millwright <\s>
<s> the first great builder of iron bridges was a stone mason and the greatest railway engineer commenced his life as a colliery engineer    117 4 the greatest advantage next to the dexterity of the workmen derived from the minute division of labor which takes place in modern manufacturing industry is one not mentioned by adam smith but to which attention has been drawn by mr <\s>
<s> babbage the more economical distribution of labor by classing the work people according to their capacity <\s>
<s> different parts of the same series of operations require unequal degrees of skill and bodily strength and those who have skill enough for the most difficult or strength enough for the hardest parts of the labor are made much more useful by being employed solely in them the operations which everybody is capable of being left to those who are fit for no others <\s>
<s> the division of labor as all writers on the subject have remarked is limited by the extent of the market <\s>
<s> if by the separation of pin making into ten distinct employments forty eight thousand pins can be made in a day this separation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers is such as to require every day something like forty eight thousand pins <\s>
<s> if there is only a demand for twenty four thousand the division of labor can only be advantageously carried to the extent which will every day produce that smaller number <\s>
<s> the increase of the general riches of the world when accompanied with freedom of commercial intercourse improvements in navigation and inland communication by roads canals or railways tends to give increased productiveness to the labor of every nation in particular by enabling each locality to supply with its special products so much larger a market that a great extension of the division of labor in their production is an ordinary consequence <\s>
<s> the division of labor is also limited in many cases by the nature of the employment <\s>
<s> agriculture for example is not susceptible of so great a division of occupations as many branches of manufactures because its different operations can not possibly be simultaneous <\s>
<s> 5    in the examples given above the advantage obtained was derived from the mere fact of the separation of employments altogether independently of the mode in which the separated employments were distributed among the persons carrying them on as well as of the places in which they were conducted <\s>
<s> but a further gain arises when the employments are of a kind which in order to their effective performance call for special capacities in the workman or special natural resources in the scene of operation <\s>
<s> there would be a manifest waste of special power in compelling to a mere mechanical or routine pursuit a man who is fitted to excel in a professional career and similarly if a branch of industry were established on some site which offered greater facilities to an industry of another sort a waste analogous in character would be incurred <\s>
<s> fertility of soil is one of the principal <\s>
<s> the influence of climate is another advantage and consists in lessening the physical requirements of the producers <\s>
<s> in spinning very fine cotton thread englands natural climate gives in some parts of the country such advantages in proper moisture and electric conditions that the operation can be carried on out of doors while in the united states it is generally necessary to create an artificial atmosphere <\s>
<s> in ordinary spinning in our country more is accomplished when the wind is in one quarter than in another <\s>
<s> the dry northwest wind in new england reduces the amount of product while the dry northeast wind in england has a similar effect and it is said has practically driven the cotton spinners from manchester to oldham where the climate is more equably moist <\s>
<s> the full reasons for these facts are not yet ascertained <\s>
<s> experts in the woolen industry also explain that the quality and fiber of wool depend upon the soil and climate where the sheep are pastured <\s>
<s> when ohio sheep are transferred to texas in a few years their wool loses the distinctive quality it formerly possessed and takes on a new character belonging to the breeds of texas <\s>
<s> the wool produced by one set of climatic conditions is quite different from that of another set and is used by the manufacturers for different purposes <\s>
<s> in hot regions mankind can exist in comfort with less perfect housing less clothing fuel that absolute necessary of life in cold climates they can almost dispense with except for industrial uses <\s>
<s> they also require less aliment <\s>
<s> among natural advantages besides soil and climate must be mentioned abundance of mineral productions in convenient situations and capable of being worked with moderate labor <\s>
<s> such are the coal fields of great britain which do so much to compensate its inhabitants for the disadvantages of climate and the scarcely inferior resource possessed by this country and the united states in a copious supply of an easily reduced iron ore at no great depth below the earths surface and in close proximity to coal deposits available for working it <\s>
<s> but perhaps a greater advantage than all these is a maritime situation especially when accompanied with good natural harbors and next to it great navigable rivers <\s>
<s> these advantages consist indeed wholly in saving of cost of carriage <\s>
<s> but few who have not considered the subject have any adequate notion how great an extent of economical advantage this comprises <\s>
<s> as the second of the general causes of superior productiveness we may rank the greater energy of labor <\s>
<s> by this is not to be understood occasional but regular and habitual energy <\s>
<s> the third element which determines the productiveness of the labor of a community is the skill and knowledge therein existing whether it be the skill and knowledge of the laborers themselves or of those who direct their labor <\s>
<s> that the productiveness of the labor of a people is limited by their knowledge of the arts of life is self evident and that any progress in those arts any improved application of the objects or powers of nature to industrial uses enables the same quantity and intensity of labor to raise a greater produce <\s>

<s> from these considerations it appears that a country will seldom have a productive agriculture unless it has a large town population or the only available substitute a large export trade in agricultural produce to supply a population elsewhere <\s>
<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>
<s> there are in a pound upward of four thousand pins of a middling size <\s>
<s> those ten persons therefore could make among them upward of forty eight thousand pins in a day <\s>
<s> each person therefore making a tenth part of forty eight thousand pins might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day <\s>
<s> but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day      3 <\s>
<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>
<s> the inventor of the power loom was a clergyman <\s>
<s> a farmer devised the application of the screw propeller <\s>
<s> a fancy goods shopkeeper is one of the most enterprising experimentalists in agriculture <\s>
<s> the most remarkable architectural design of our day has been furnished by a gardener <\s>
<s> the first person who supplied london with water was a goldsmith <\s>
<s> the first extensive maker of english roads was a blind man bred to no trade <\s>
<s> the father of english inland navigation was a duke and his engineer was a millwright <\s>
<s> the first great builder of iron bridges was a stone mason and the greatest railway engineer commenced his life as a colliery engineer    117 4 the greatest advantage next to the dexterity of the workmen derived from the minute division of labor which takes place in modern manufacturing industry is one not mentioned by adam smith but to which attention has been drawn by mr <\s>
<s> babbage the more economical distribution of labor by classing the work people according to their capacity <\s>
<s> different parts of the same series of operations require unequal degrees of skill and bodily strength and those who have skill enough for the most difficult or strength enough for the hardest parts of the labor are made much more useful by being employed solely in them the operations which everybody is capable of being left to those who are fit for no others <\s>
<s> the division of labor as all writers on the subject have remarked is limited by the extent of the market <\s>
<s> if by the separation of pin making into ten distinct employments forty eight thousand pins can be made in a day this separation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers is such as to require every day something like forty eight thousand pins <\s>
<s> if there is only a demand for twenty four thousand the division of labor can only be advantageously carried to the extent which will every day produce that smaller number <\s>
<s> the increase of the general riches of the world when accompanied with freedom of commercial intercourse improvements in navigation and inland communication by roads canals or railways tends to give increased productiveness to the labor of every nation in particular by enabling each locality to supply with its special products so much larger a market that a great extension of the division of labor in their production is an ordinary consequence <\s>
<s> the division of labor is also limited in many cases by the nature of the employment <\s>
<s> agriculture for example is not susceptible of so great a division of occupations as many branches of manufactures because its different operations can not possibly be simultaneous <\s>
<s> 5    in the examples given above the advantage obtained was derived from the mere fact of the separation of employments altogether independently of the mode in which the separated employments were distributed among the persons carrying them on as well as of the places in which they were conducted <\s>
<s> but a further gain arises when the employments are of a kind which in order to their effective performance call for special capacities in the workman or special natural resources in the scene of operation <\s>
<s> there would be a manifest waste of special power in compelling to a mere mechanical or routine pursuit a man who is fitted to excel in a professional career and similarly if a branch of industry were established on some site which offered greater facilities to an industry of another sort a waste analogous in character would be incurred <\s>
<s> fertility of soil is one of the principal <\s>
<s> the influence of climate is another advantage and consists in lessening the physical requirements of the producers <\s>
<s> in spinning very fine cotton thread englands natural climate gives in some parts of the country such advantages in proper moisture and electric conditions that the operation can be carried on out of doors while in the united states it is generally necessary to create an artificial atmosphere <\s>
<s> in ordinary spinning in our country more is accomplished when the wind is in one quarter than in another <\s>
<s> the dry northwest wind in new england reduces the amount of product while the dry northeast wind in england has a similar effect and it is said has practically driven the cotton spinners from manchester to oldham where the climate is more equably moist <\s>
<s> the full reasons for these facts are not yet ascertained <\s>
<s> experts in the woolen industry also explain that the quality and fiber of wool depend upon the soil and climate where the sheep are pastured <\s>
<s> when ohio sheep are transferred to texas in a few years their wool loses the distinctive quality it formerly possessed and takes on a new character belonging to the breeds of texas <\s>
<s> the wool produced by one set of climatic conditions is quite different from that of another set and is used by the manufacturers for different purposes <\s>
<s> in hot regions mankind can exist in comfort with less perfect housing less clothing fuel that absolute necessary of life in cold climates they can almost dispense with except for industrial uses <\s>
<s> they also require less aliment <\s>
<s> among natural advantages besides soil and climate must be mentioned abundance of mineral productions in convenient situations and capable of being worked with moderate labor <\s>
<s> such are the coal fields of great britain which do so much to compensate its inhabitants for the disadvantages of climate and the scarcely inferior resource possessed by this country and the united states in a copious supply of an easily reduced iron ore at no great depth below the earths surface and in close proximity to coal deposits available for working it <\s>
<s> but perhaps a greater advantage than all these is a maritime situation especially when accompanied with good natural harbors and next to it great navigable rivers <\s>
<s> these advantages consist indeed wholly in saving of cost of carriage <\s>
<s> but few who have not considered the subject have any adequate notion how great an extent of economical advantage this comprises <\s>
<s> as the second of the general causes of superior productiveness we may rank the greater energy of labor <\s>
<s> by this is not to be understood occasional but regular and habitual energy <\s>
<s> the third element which determines the productiveness of the labor of a community is the skill and knowledge therein existing whether it be the skill and knowledge of the laborers themselves or of those who direct their labor <\s>
<s> that the productiveness of the labor of a people is limited by their knowledge of the arts of life is self evident and that any progress in those arts any improved application of the objects or powers of nature to industrial uses enables the same quantity and intensity of labor to raise a greater produce <\s>
<s> one principal department of these improvements consists in the invention and use of tools and machinery 114 the deficiency of practical good sense which renders the majority of the laboring class such bad calculatorswhich makes for instance their domestic economy so improvident lax and irregularmust disqualify them for any but a low grade of intelligent labor and render their industry far less productive than with equal energy it otherwise might be <\s>
<s> the moral qualities of the laborers are fully as important to the efficiency and worth of their labor as the intellectual <\s>
<s> independently of the effects of intemperance upon their bodily and mental faculties and of flighty unsteady habits upon the energy and continuity of their work points so easily understood as not to require being insisted upon it is well worthy of meditation how much of the aggregate effect of their labor depends on their trustworthiness <\s>
<s> among the secondary causes which determine the productiveness of productive agents the most important is security <\s>
<s> by security i mean the completeness of the protection which society affords to its members <\s>
<s> combination and division of labor increase productiveness <\s>
<s> in the enumeration of the circumstances which promote the productiveness of labor we have left one untouched which is co operation or the combined action of numbers <\s>
<s> of this great aid to production a single department known by the name of division of labor has engaged a large share of the attention of political economists most deservedly indeed but to the exclusion of other cases and exemplifications of the same comprehensive law <\s>
<s> in the lifting of heavy weights for example in the felling of trees in the sawing of timber in the gathering of much hay or corn during a short period of fine weather in draining a large extent of land during the short season when such a work may be properly conducted in the pulling of ropes on board ship in the rowing of large boats in some mining operations in the erection of a scaffolding for building and in the breaking of stones for the repair of a road so that the whole of the road shall always be kept in good order in all these simple operations and thousands more it is absolutely necessary that many persons should work together at the same time in the same place and in the same way <\s>

<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>

<s> the father of english inland navigation was a duke and his engineer was a millwright <\s>
<s> the first great builder of iron bridges was a stone mason and the greatest railway engineer commenced his life as a colliery engineer    117 4 the greatest advantage next to the dexterity of the workmen derived from the minute division of labor which takes place in modern manufacturing industry is one not mentioned by adam smith but to which attention has been drawn by mr <\s>
<s> babbage the more economical distribution of labor by classing the work people according to their capacity <\s>
<s> different parts of the same series of operations require unequal degrees of skill and bodily strength and those who have skill enough for the most difficult or strength enough for the hardest parts of the labor are made much more useful by being employed solely in them the operations which everybody is capable of being left to those who are fit for no others <\s>
<s> the division of labor as all writers on the subject have remarked is limited by the extent of the market <\s>
<s> if by the separation of pin making into ten distinct employments forty eight thousand pins can be made in a day this separation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers is such as to require every day something like forty eight thousand pins <\s>
<s> if there is only a demand for twenty four thousand the division of labor can only be advantageously carried to the extent which will every day produce that smaller number <\s>
<s> the increase of the general riches of the world when accompanied with freedom of commercial intercourse improvements in navigation and inland communication by roads canals or railways tends to give increased productiveness to the labor of every nation in particular by enabling each locality to supply with its special products so much larger a market that a great extension of the division of labor in their production is an ordinary consequence <\s>
<s> the division of labor is also limited in many cases by the nature of the employment <\s>
<s> agriculture for example is not susceptible of so great a division of occupations as many branches of manufactures because its different operations can not possibly be simultaneous <\s>
<s> 5    in the examples given above the advantage obtained was derived from the mere fact of the separation of employments altogether independently of the mode in which the separated employments were distributed among the persons carrying them on as well as of the places in which they were conducted <\s>
<s> but a further gain arises when the employments are of a kind which in order to their effective performance call for special capacities in the workman or special natural resources in the scene of operation <\s>
<s> there would be a manifest waste of special power in compelling to a mere mechanical or routine pursuit a man who is fitted to excel in a professional career and similarly if a branch of industry were established on some site which offered greater facilities to an industry of another sort a waste analogous in character would be incurred <\s>
<s> fertility of soil is one of the principal <\s>
<s> the influence of climate is another advantage and consists in lessening the physical requirements of the producers <\s>
<s> in spinning very fine cotton thread englands natural climate gives in some parts of the country such advantages in proper moisture and electric conditions that the operation can be carried on out of doors while in the united states it is generally necessary to create an artificial atmosphere <\s>

<s> the full reasons for these facts are not yet ascertained <\s>
<s> experts in the woolen industry also explain that the quality and fiber of wool depend upon the soil and climate where the sheep are pastured <\s>

<s> the wool produced by one set of climatic conditions is quite different from that of another set and is used by the manufacturers for different purposes <\s>
<s> in hot regions mankind can exist in comfort with less perfect housing less clothing fuel that absolute necessary of life in cold climates they can almost dispense with except for industrial uses <\s>
<s> they also require less aliment <\s>
<s> among natural advantages besides soil and climate must be mentioned abundance of mineral productions in convenient situations and capable of being worked with moderate labor <\s>
<s> such are the coal fields of great britain which do so much to compensate its inhabitants for the disadvantages of climate and the scarcely inferior resource possessed by this country and the united states in a copious supply of an easily reduced iron ore at no great depth below the earths surface and in close proximity to coal deposits available for working it <\s>
<s> but perhaps a greater advantage than all these is a maritime situation especially when accompanied with good natural harbors and next to it great navigable rivers <\s>
<s> these advantages consist indeed wholly in saving of cost of carriage <\s>
<s> but few who have not considered the subject have any adequate notion how great an extent of economical advantage this comprises <\s>
<s> as the second of the general causes of superior productiveness we may rank the greater energy of labor <\s>
<s> by this is not to be understood occasional but regular and habitual energy <\s>

<s> independently of the effects of intemperance upon their bodily and mental faculties and of flighty unsteady habits upon the energy and continuity of their work points so easily understood as not to require being insisted upon it is well worthy of meditation how much of the aggregate effect of their labor depends on their trustworthiness <\s>

<s> in the enumeration of the circumstances which promote the productiveness of labor we have left one untouched which is co operation or the combined action of numbers <\s>
<s> of this great aid to production a single department known by the name of division of labor has engaged a large share of the attention of political economists most deservedly indeed but to the exclusion of other cases and exemplifications of the same comprehensive law <\s>
<s> in the lifting of heavy weights for example in the felling of trees in the sawing of timber in the gathering of much hay or corn during a short period of fine weather in draining a large extent of land during the short season when such a work may be properly conducted in the pulling of ropes on board ship in the rowing of large boats in some mining operations in the erection of a scaffolding for building and in the breaking of stones for the repair of a road so that the whole of the road shall always be kept in good order in all these simple operations and thousands more it is absolutely necessary that many persons should work together at the same time in the same place and in the same way <\s>
<s> but in the present state of society the breeding and feeding of sheep is the occupation of one set of people dressing the wool to prepare it for the spinner is that of another spinning it into thread of a third weaving the thread into broadcloth of a fourth dyeing the cloth of a fifth making it into a coat of a sixth without counting the multitude of carriers merchants factors and retailers put in requisition at the successive stages of this progress <\s>
<s> without some separation of employments very few things would be produced at all <\s>
<s> suppose a set of persons or a number of families all employed precisely in the same manner each family settled on a piece of its own land on which it grows by its labor the food required for its own sustenance and as there are no persons to buy any surplus produce where all are producers each family has to produce within itself whatever other articles it consumes <\s>

<s> there is no inconsistency between this doctrine and the proposition we before maintained 115 that a market for commodities does not constitute employment for labor <\s>

<s> but beyond simple food precarious too from the variations of the seasons coarse clothing and very imperfect lodging it would be scarcely possible that the family should produce anything more <\s>
<s> suppose that a company of artificers provided with tools and with food sufficient to maintain them for a year arrive in the country and establish themselves in the midst of the population <\s>
<s> these new settlers occupy themselves in producing articles of use or ornament adapted to the taste of a simple people and before their food is exhausted they have produced these in considerable quantity and are ready to exchange them for more food <\s>
<s> the economical position of the landed population is now most materially altered <\s>
<s> they have an opportunity given them of acquiring comforts and luxuries <\s>
<s> things which while they depended solely upon their own labor they never could have obtained because they could not have produced are now accessible to them if they can succeed in producing an additional quantity of food and necessaries <\s>
<s> they are thus incited to increase the productiveness of their industry <\s>
<s> the new settlers constitute what is called a market for surplus agricultural produce and their arrival has enriched the settlement not only by the manufactured articles which they produce but by the food which would not have been produced unless they had been there to consume it <\s>
<s> there is no inconsistency between this doctrine and the proposition we before maintained 115 that a market for commodities does not constitute employment for labor <\s>
<s> the labor of the agriculturists was already provided with employment they are not indebted to the demand of the new comers for being able to maintain themselves <\s>

<s> from these considerations it appears that a country will seldom have a productive agriculture unless it has a large town population or the only available substitute a large export trade in agricultural produce to supply a population elsewhere <\s>
<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>

<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>

<s> without some separation of employments very few things would be produced at all <\s>
<s> suppose a set of persons or a number of families all employed precisely in the same manner each family settled on a piece of its own land on which it grows by its labor the food required for its own sustenance and as there are no persons to buy any surplus produce where all are producers each family has to produce within itself whatever other articles it consumes <\s>
<s> in such circumstances if the soil was tolerably fertile and population did not tread too closely on the heels of subsistence there would be no doubt some kind of domestic manufactures clothing for the family might perhaps be spun and woven within it by the labor probably of the women a first step in the separation of employments ); and a dwelling of some sort would be erected and kept in repair by their united labor <\s>
<s> but beyond simple food precarious too from the variations of the seasons coarse clothing and very imperfect lodging it would be scarcely possible that the family should produce anything more <\s>
<s> suppose that a company of artificers provided with tools and with food sufficient to maintain them for a year arrive in the country and establish themselves in the midst of the population <\s>
<s> these new settlers occupy themselves in producing articles of use or ornament adapted to the taste of a simple people and before their food is exhausted they have produced these in considerable quantity and are ready to exchange them for more food <\s>
<s> the economical position of the landed population is now most materially altered <\s>
<s> they have an opportunity given them of acquiring comforts and luxuries <\s>
<s> things which while they depended solely upon their own labor they never could have obtained because they could not have produced are now accessible to them if they can succeed in producing an additional quantity of food and necessaries <\s>
<s> they are thus incited to increase the productiveness of their industry <\s>
<s> the new settlers constitute what is called a market for surplus agricultural produce and their arrival has enriched the settlement not only by the manufactured articles which they produce but by the food which would not have been produced unless they had been there to consume it <\s>
<s> there is no inconsistency between this doctrine and the proposition we before maintained 115 that a market for commodities does not constitute employment for labor <\s>
<s> the labor of the agriculturists was already provided with employment they are not indebted to the demand of the new comers for being able to maintain themselves <\s>
<s> what that demand does for them is to call their labor into increased vigor and efficiency to stimulate them by new motives to new exertions <\s>
<s> from these considerations it appears that a country will seldom have a productive agriculture unless it has a large town population or the only available substitute a large export trade in agricultural produce to supply a population elsewhere <\s>
<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>
<s> there are in a pound upward of four thousand pins of a middling size <\s>
<s> those ten persons therefore could make among them upward of forty eight thousand pins in a day <\s>
<s> each person therefore making a tenth part of forty eight thousand pins might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day <\s>
<s> but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day      3 <\s>
<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>
<s> the inventor of the power loom was a clergyman <\s>

<s> but beyond simple food precarious too from the variations of the seasons coarse clothing and very imperfect lodging it would be scarcely possible that the family should produce anything more <\s>

<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>
<s> there are in a pound upward of four thousand pins of a middling size <\s>
<s> those ten persons therefore could make among them upward of forty eight thousand pins in a day <\s>
<s> each person therefore making a tenth part of forty eight thousand pins might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day <\s>
<s> but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day      3 <\s>
<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>
<s> the inventor of the power loom was a clergyman <\s>
<s> a farmer devised the application of the screw propeller <\s>
<s> a fancy goods shopkeeper is one of the most enterprising experimentalists in agriculture <\s>
<s> the most remarkable architectural design of our day has been furnished by a gardener <\s>
<s> the first person who supplied london with water was a goldsmith <\s>
<s> the first extensive maker of english roads was a blind man bred to no trade <\s>
<s> the father of english inland navigation was a duke and his engineer was a millwright <\s>
<s> the first great builder of iron bridges was a stone mason and the greatest railway engineer commenced his life as a colliery engineer    117 4 the greatest advantage next to the dexterity of the workmen derived from the minute division of labor which takes place in modern manufacturing industry is one not mentioned by adam smith but to which attention has been drawn by mr <\s>
<s> babbage the more economical distribution of labor by classing the work people according to their capacity <\s>
<s> different parts of the same series of operations require unequal degrees of skill and bodily strength and those who have skill enough for the most difficult or strength enough for the hardest parts of the labor are made much more useful by being employed solely in them the operations which everybody is capable of being left to those who are fit for no others <\s>
<s> the division of labor as all writers on the subject have remarked is limited by the extent of the market <\s>
<s> if by the separation of pin making into ten distinct employments forty eight thousand pins can be made in a day this separation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers is such as to require every day something like forty eight thousand pins <\s>
<s> if there is only a demand for twenty four thousand the division of labor can only be advantageously carried to the extent which will every day produce that smaller number <\s>
<s> the increase of the general riches of the world when accompanied with freedom of commercial intercourse improvements in navigation and inland communication by roads canals or railways tends to give increased productiveness to the labor of every nation in particular by enabling each locality to supply with its special products so much larger a market that a great extension of the division of labor in their production is an ordinary consequence <\s>
<s> the division of labor is also limited in many cases by the nature of the employment <\s>
<s> agriculture for example is not susceptible of so great a division of occupations as many branches of manufactures because its different operations can not possibly be simultaneous <\s>

<s> without some separation of employments very few things would be produced at all <\s>
<s> suppose a set of persons or a number of families all employed precisely in the same manner each family settled on a piece of its own land on which it grows by its labor the food required for its own sustenance and as there are no persons to buy any surplus produce where all are producers each family has to produce within itself whatever other articles it consumes <\s>
<s> in such circumstances if the soil was tolerably fertile and population did not tread too closely on the heels of subsistence there would be no doubt some kind of domestic manufactures clothing for the family might perhaps be spun and woven within it by the labor probably of the women a first step in the separation of employments ); and a dwelling of some sort would be erected and kept in repair by their united labor <\s>
<s> but beyond simple food precarious too from the variations of the seasons coarse clothing and very imperfect lodging it would be scarcely possible that the family should produce anything more <\s>

<s> these new settlers occupy themselves in producing articles of use or ornament adapted to the taste of a simple people and before their food is exhausted they have produced these in considerable quantity and are ready to exchange them for more food <\s>

<s> they have an opportunity given them of acquiring comforts and luxuries <\s>
<s> things which while they depended solely upon their own labor they never could have obtained because they could not have produced are now accessible to them if they can succeed in producing an additional quantity of food and necessaries <\s>
<s> they are thus incited to increase the productiveness of their industry <\s>
<s> the new settlers constitute what is called a market for surplus agricultural produce and their arrival has enriched the settlement not only by the manufactured articles which they produce but by the food which would not have been produced unless they had been there to consume it <\s>
<s> there is no inconsistency between this doctrine and the proposition we before maintained 115 that a market for commodities does not constitute employment for labor <\s>

<s> from these considerations it appears that a country will seldom have a productive agriculture unless it has a large town population or the only available substitute a large export trade in agricultural produce to supply a population elsewhere <\s>
<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>
<s> there are in a pound upward of four thousand pins of a middling size <\s>
<s> those ten persons therefore could make among them upward of forty eight thousand pins in a day <\s>
<s> each person therefore making a tenth part of forty eight thousand pins might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day <\s>
<s> but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day      3 <\s>
<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>
<s> the inventor of the power loom was a clergyman <\s>
<s> a farmer devised the application of the screw propeller <\s>
<s> a fancy goods shopkeeper is one of the most enterprising experimentalists in agriculture <\s>
<s> the most remarkable architectural design of our day has been furnished by a gardener <\s>
<s> the first person who supplied london with water was a goldsmith <\s>
<s> the first extensive maker of english roads was a blind man bred to no trade <\s>
<s> the father of english inland navigation was a duke and his engineer was a millwright <\s>
<s> the first great builder of iron bridges was a stone mason and the greatest railway engineer commenced his life as a colliery engineer    117 4 the greatest advantage next to the dexterity of the workmen derived from the minute division of labor which takes place in modern manufacturing industry is one not mentioned by adam smith but to which attention has been drawn by mr <\s>
<s> babbage the more economical distribution of labor by classing the work people according to their capacity <\s>
<s> different parts of the same series of operations require unequal degrees of skill and bodily strength and those who have skill enough for the most difficult or strength enough for the hardest parts of the labor are made much more useful by being employed solely in them the operations which everybody is capable of being left to those who are fit for no others <\s>
<s> the division of labor as all writers on the subject have remarked is limited by the extent of the market <\s>
<s> if by the separation of pin making into ten distinct employments forty eight thousand pins can be made in a day this separation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers is such as to require every day something like forty eight thousand pins <\s>
<s> if there is only a demand for twenty four thousand the division of labor can only be advantageously carried to the extent which will every day produce that smaller number <\s>
<s> the increase of the general riches of the world when accompanied with freedom of commercial intercourse improvements in navigation and inland communication by roads canals or railways tends to give increased productiveness to the labor of every nation in particular by enabling each locality to supply with its special products so much larger a market that a great extension of the division of labor in their production is an ordinary consequence <\s>
<s> the division of labor is also limited in many cases by the nature of the employment <\s>
<s> agriculture for example is not susceptible of so great a division of occupations as many branches of manufactures because its different operations can not possibly be simultaneous <\s>
<s> 5    in the examples given above the advantage obtained was derived from the mere fact of the separation of employments altogether independently of the mode in which the separated employments were distributed among the persons carrying them on as well as of the places in which they were conducted <\s>
<s> but a further gain arises when the employments are of a kind which in order to their effective performance call for special capacities in the workman or special natural resources in the scene of operation <\s>
<s> there would be a manifest waste of special power in compelling to a mere mechanical or routine pursuit a man who is fitted to excel in a professional career and similarly if a branch of industry were established on some site which offered greater facilities to an industry of another sort a waste analogous in character would be incurred <\s>
<s> fertility of soil is one of the principal <\s>
<s> the influence of climate is another advantage and consists in lessening the physical requirements of the producers <\s>
<s> in spinning very fine cotton thread englands natural climate gives in some parts of the country such advantages in proper moisture and electric conditions that the operation can be carried on out of doors while in the united states it is generally necessary to create an artificial atmosphere <\s>
<s> in ordinary spinning in our country more is accomplished when the wind is in one quarter than in another <\s>
<s> the dry northwest wind in new england reduces the amount of product while the dry northeast wind in england has a similar effect and it is said has practically driven the cotton spinners from manchester to oldham where the climate is more equably moist <\s>
<s> the full reasons for these facts are not yet ascertained <\s>
<s> experts in the woolen industry also explain that the quality and fiber of wool depend upon the soil and climate where the sheep are pastured <\s>
<s> when ohio sheep are transferred to texas in a few years their wool loses the distinctive quality it formerly possessed and takes on a new character belonging to the breeds of texas <\s>
<s> the wool produced by one set of climatic conditions is quite different from that of another set and is used by the manufacturers for different purposes <\s>
<s> in hot regions mankind can exist in comfort with less perfect housing less clothing fuel that absolute necessary of life in cold climates they can almost dispense with except for industrial uses <\s>

<s> but beyond simple food precarious too from the variations of the seasons coarse clothing and very imperfect lodging it would be scarcely possible that the family should produce anything more <\s>

<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>
<s> there are in a pound upward of four thousand pins of a middling size <\s>
<s> those ten persons therefore could make among them upward of forty eight thousand pins in a day <\s>
<s> each person therefore making a tenth part of forty eight thousand pins might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day <\s>
<s> but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day      3 <\s>
<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>
<s> the inventor of the power loom was a clergyman <\s>
<s> a farmer devised the application of the screw propeller <\s>
<s> a fancy goods shopkeeper is one of the most enterprising experimentalists in agriculture <\s>
<s> the most remarkable architectural design of our day has been furnished by a gardener <\s>
<s> the first person who supplied london with water was a goldsmith <\s>
<s> the first extensive maker of english roads was a blind man bred to no trade <\s>
<s> the father of english inland navigation was a duke and his engineer was a millwright <\s>
<s> the first great builder of iron bridges was a stone mason and the greatest railway engineer commenced his life as a colliery engineer    117 4 the greatest advantage next to the dexterity of the workmen derived from the minute division of labor which takes place in modern manufacturing industry is one not mentioned by adam smith but to which attention has been drawn by mr <\s>
<s> babbage the more economical distribution of labor by classing the work people according to their capacity <\s>
<s> different parts of the same series of operations require unequal degrees of skill and bodily strength and those who have skill enough for the most difficult or strength enough for the hardest parts of the labor are made much more useful by being employed solely in them the operations which everybody is capable of being left to those who are fit for no others <\s>
<s> the division of labor as all writers on the subject have remarked is limited by the extent of the market <\s>
<s> if by the separation of pin making into ten distinct employments forty eight thousand pins can be made in a day this separation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers is such as to require every day something like forty eight thousand pins <\s>
<s> if there is only a demand for twenty four thousand the division of labor can only be advantageously carried to the extent which will every day produce that smaller number <\s>
<s> the increase of the general riches of the world when accompanied with freedom of commercial intercourse improvements in navigation and inland communication by roads canals or railways tends to give increased productiveness to the labor of every nation in particular by enabling each locality to supply with its special products so much larger a market that a great extension of the division of labor in their production is an ordinary consequence <\s>
<s> the division of labor is also limited in many cases by the nature of the employment <\s>
<s> agriculture for example is not susceptible of so great a division of occupations as many branches of manufactures because its different operations can not possibly be simultaneous <\s>
<s> 5    in the examples given above the advantage obtained was derived from the mere fact of the separation of employments altogether independently of the mode in which the separated employments were distributed among the persons carrying them on as well as of the places in which they were conducted <\s>
<s> but a further gain arises when the employments are of a kind which in order to their effective performance call for special capacities in the workman or special natural resources in the scene of operation <\s>
<s> there would be a manifest waste of special power in compelling to a mere mechanical or routine pursuit a man who is fitted to excel in a professional career and similarly if a branch of industry were established on some site which offered greater facilities to an industry of another sort a waste analogous in character would be incurred <\s>
<s> fertility of soil is one of the principal <\s>
<s> the influence of climate is another advantage and consists in lessening the physical requirements of the producers <\s>
<s> in spinning very fine cotton thread englands natural climate gives in some parts of the country such advantages in proper moisture and electric conditions that the operation can be carried on out of doors while in the united states it is generally necessary to create an artificial atmosphere <\s>
<s> in ordinary spinning in our country more is accomplished when the wind is in one quarter than in another <\s>
<s> the dry northwest wind in new england reduces the amount of product while the dry northeast wind in england has a similar effect and it is said has practically driven the cotton spinners from manchester to oldham where the climate is more equably moist <\s>
<s> the full reasons for these facts are not yet ascertained <\s>
<s> experts in the woolen industry also explain that the quality and fiber of wool depend upon the soil and climate where the sheep are pastured <\s>
<s> when ohio sheep are transferred to texas in a few years their wool loses the distinctive quality it formerly possessed and takes on a new character belonging to the breeds of texas <\s>
<s> the wool produced by one set of climatic conditions is quite different from that of another set and is used by the manufacturers for different purposes <\s>
<s> in hot regions mankind can exist in comfort with less perfect housing less clothing fuel that absolute necessary of life in cold climates they can almost dispense with except for industrial uses <\s>
<s> they also require less aliment <\s>
<s> among natural advantages besides soil and climate must be mentioned abundance of mineral productions in convenient situations and capable of being worked with moderate labor <\s>
<s> such are the coal fields of great britain which do so much to compensate its inhabitants for the disadvantages of climate and the scarcely inferior resource possessed by this country and the united states in a copious supply of an easily reduced iron ore at no great depth below the earths surface and in close proximity to coal deposits available for working it <\s>
<s> but perhaps a greater advantage than all these is a maritime situation especially when accompanied with good natural harbors and next to it great navigable rivers <\s>
<s> these advantages consist indeed wholly in saving of cost of carriage <\s>
<s> but few who have not considered the subject have any adequate notion how great an extent of economical advantage this comprises <\s>
<s> as the second of the general causes of superior productiveness we may rank the greater energy of labor <\s>
<s> by this is not to be understood occasional but regular and habitual energy <\s>
<s> the third element which determines the productiveness of the labor of a community is the skill and knowledge therein existing whether it be the skill and knowledge of the laborers themselves or of those who direct their labor <\s>
<s> that the productiveness of the labor of a people is limited by their knowledge of the arts of life is self evident and that any progress in those arts any improved application of the objects or powers of nature to industrial uses enables the same quantity and intensity of labor to raise a greater produce <\s>

<s> from these considerations it appears that a country will seldom have a productive agriculture unless it has a large town population or the only available substitute a large export trade in agricultural produce to supply a population elsewhere <\s>
<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>
<s> there are in a pound upward of four thousand pins of a middling size <\s>
<s> those ten persons therefore could make among them upward of forty eight thousand pins in a day <\s>
<s> each person therefore making a tenth part of forty eight thousand pins might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day <\s>
<s> but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day      3 <\s>
<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>
<s> the inventor of the power loom was a clergyman <\s>
<s> a farmer devised the application of the screw propeller <\s>
<s> a fancy goods shopkeeper is one of the most enterprising experimentalists in agriculture <\s>
<s> the most remarkable architectural design of our day has been furnished by a gardener <\s>
<s> the first person who supplied london with water was a goldsmith <\s>
<s> the first extensive maker of english roads was a blind man bred to no trade <\s>
<s> the father of english inland navigation was a duke and his engineer was a millwright <\s>
<s> the first great builder of iron bridges was a stone mason and the greatest railway engineer commenced his life as a colliery engineer    117 4 the greatest advantage next to the dexterity of the workmen derived from the minute division of labor which takes place in modern manufacturing industry is one not mentioned by adam smith but to which attention has been drawn by mr <\s>
<s> babbage the more economical distribution of labor by classing the work people according to their capacity <\s>
<s> different parts of the same series of operations require unequal degrees of skill and bodily strength and those who have skill enough for the most difficult or strength enough for the hardest parts of the labor are made much more useful by being employed solely in them the operations which everybody is capable of being left to those who are fit for no others <\s>
<s> the division of labor as all writers on the subject have remarked is limited by the extent of the market <\s>
<s> if by the separation of pin making into ten distinct employments forty eight thousand pins can be made in a day this separation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers is such as to require every day something like forty eight thousand pins <\s>
<s> if there is only a demand for twenty four thousand the division of labor can only be advantageously carried to the extent which will every day produce that smaller number <\s>
<s> the increase of the general riches of the world when accompanied with freedom of commercial intercourse improvements in navigation and inland communication by roads canals or railways tends to give increased productiveness to the labor of every nation in particular by enabling each locality to supply with its special products so much larger a market that a great extension of the division of labor in their production is an ordinary consequence <\s>
<s> the division of labor is also limited in many cases by the nature of the employment <\s>
<s> agriculture for example is not susceptible of so great a division of occupations as many branches of manufactures because its different operations can not possibly be simultaneous <\s>
<s> 5    in the examples given above the advantage obtained was derived from the mere fact of the separation of employments altogether independently of the mode in which the separated employments were distributed among the persons carrying them on as well as of the places in which they were conducted <\s>
<s> but a further gain arises when the employments are of a kind which in order to their effective performance call for special capacities in the workman or special natural resources in the scene of operation <\s>
<s> there would be a manifest waste of special power in compelling to a mere mechanical or routine pursuit a man who is fitted to excel in a professional career and similarly if a branch of industry were established on some site which offered greater facilities to an industry of another sort a waste analogous in character would be incurred <\s>
<s> fertility of soil is one of the principal <\s>
<s> the influence of climate is another advantage and consists in lessening the physical requirements of the producers <\s>
<s> in spinning very fine cotton thread englands natural climate gives in some parts of the country such advantages in proper moisture and electric conditions that the operation can be carried on out of doors while in the united states it is generally necessary to create an artificial atmosphere <\s>
<s> in ordinary spinning in our country more is accomplished when the wind is in one quarter than in another <\s>
<s> the dry northwest wind in new england reduces the amount of product while the dry northeast wind in england has a similar effect and it is said has practically driven the cotton spinners from manchester to oldham where the climate is more equably moist <\s>
<s> the full reasons for these facts are not yet ascertained <\s>
<s> experts in the woolen industry also explain that the quality and fiber of wool depend upon the soil and climate where the sheep are pastured <\s>
<s> when ohio sheep are transferred to texas in a few years their wool loses the distinctive quality it formerly possessed and takes on a new character belonging to the breeds of texas <\s>
<s> the wool produced by one set of climatic conditions is quite different from that of another set and is used by the manufacturers for different purposes <\s>
<s> in hot regions mankind can exist in comfort with less perfect housing less clothing fuel that absolute necessary of life in cold climates they can almost dispense with except for industrial uses <\s>
<s> they also require less aliment <\s>
<s> among natural advantages besides soil and climate must be mentioned abundance of mineral productions in convenient situations and capable of being worked with moderate labor <\s>
<s> such are the coal fields of great britain which do so much to compensate its inhabitants for the disadvantages of climate and the scarcely inferior resource possessed by this country and the united states in a copious supply of an easily reduced iron ore at no great depth below the earths surface and in close proximity to coal deposits available for working it <\s>
<s> but perhaps a greater advantage than all these is a maritime situation especially when accompanied with good natural harbors and next to it great navigable rivers <\s>
<s> these advantages consist indeed wholly in saving of cost of carriage <\s>
<s> but few who have not considered the subject have any adequate notion how great an extent of economical advantage this comprises <\s>
<s> as the second of the general causes of superior productiveness we may rank the greater energy of labor <\s>
<s> by this is not to be understood occasional but regular and habitual energy <\s>
<s> the third element which determines the productiveness of the labor of a community is the skill and knowledge therein existing whether it be the skill and knowledge of the laborers themselves or of those who direct their labor <\s>
<s> that the productiveness of the labor of a people is limited by their knowledge of the arts of life is self evident and that any progress in those arts any improved application of the objects or powers of nature to industrial uses enables the same quantity and intensity of labor to raise a greater produce <\s>
<s> one principal department of these improvements consists in the invention and use of tools and machinery 114 the deficiency of practical good sense which renders the majority of the laboring class such bad calculatorswhich makes for instance their domestic economy so improvident lax and irregularmust disqualify them for any but a low grade of intelligent labor and render their industry far less productive than with equal energy it otherwise might be <\s>
<s> the moral qualities of the laborers are fully as important to the efficiency and worth of their labor as the intellectual <\s>
<s> independently of the effects of intemperance upon their bodily and mental faculties and of flighty unsteady habits upon the energy and continuity of their work points so easily understood as not to require being insisted upon it is well worthy of meditation how much of the aggregate effect of their labor depends on their trustworthiness <\s>
<s> among the secondary causes which determine the productiveness of productive agents the most important is security <\s>
<s> by security i mean the completeness of the protection which society affords to its members <\s>
<s> combination and division of labor increase productiveness <\s>
<s> in the enumeration of the circumstances which promote the productiveness of labor we have left one untouched which is co operation or the combined action of numbers <\s>
<s> of this great aid to production a single department known by the name of division of labor has engaged a large share of the attention of political economists most deservedly indeed but to the exclusion of other cases and exemplifications of the same comprehensive law <\s>
<s> in the lifting of heavy weights for example in the felling of trees in the sawing of timber in the gathering of much hay or corn during a short period of fine weather in draining a large extent of land during the short season when such a work may be properly conducted in the pulling of ropes on board ship in the rowing of large boats in some mining operations in the erection of a scaffolding for building and in the breaking of stones for the repair of a road so that the whole of the road shall always be kept in good order in all these simple operations and thousands more it is absolutely necessary that many persons should work together at the same time in the same place and in the same way <\s>

<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>

<s> the father of english inland navigation was a duke and his engineer was a millwright <\s>
<s> the first great builder of iron bridges was a stone mason and the greatest railway engineer commenced his life as a colliery engineer    117 4 the greatest advantage next to the dexterity of the workmen derived from the minute division of labor which takes place in modern manufacturing industry is one not mentioned by adam smith but to which attention has been drawn by mr <\s>
<s> babbage the more economical distribution of labor by classing the work people according to their capacity <\s>
<s> different parts of the same series of operations require unequal degrees of skill and bodily strength and those who have skill enough for the most difficult or strength enough for the hardest parts of the labor are made much more useful by being employed solely in them the operations which everybody is capable of being left to those who are fit for no others <\s>
<s> the division of labor as all writers on the subject have remarked is limited by the extent of the market <\s>
<s> if by the separation of pin making into ten distinct employments forty eight thousand pins can be made in a day this separation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers is such as to require every day something like forty eight thousand pins <\s>
<s> if there is only a demand for twenty four thousand the division of labor can only be advantageously carried to the extent which will every day produce that smaller number <\s>
<s> the increase of the general riches of the world when accompanied with freedom of commercial intercourse improvements in navigation and inland communication by roads canals or railways tends to give increased productiveness to the labor of every nation in particular by enabling each locality to supply with its special products so much larger a market that a great extension of the division of labor in their production is an ordinary consequence <\s>
<s> the division of labor is also limited in many cases by the nature of the employment <\s>
<s> agriculture for example is not susceptible of so great a division of occupations as many branches of manufactures because its different operations can not possibly be simultaneous <\s>
<s> 5    in the examples given above the advantage obtained was derived from the mere fact of the separation of employments altogether independently of the mode in which the separated employments were distributed among the persons carrying them on as well as of the places in which they were conducted <\s>
<s> but a further gain arises when the employments are of a kind which in order to their effective performance call for special capacities in the workman or special natural resources in the scene of operation <\s>
<s> there would be a manifest waste of special power in compelling to a mere mechanical or routine pursuit a man who is fitted to excel in a professional career and similarly if a branch of industry were established on some site which offered greater facilities to an industry of another sort a waste analogous in character would be incurred <\s>
<s> fertility of soil is one of the principal <\s>
<s> the influence of climate is another advantage and consists in lessening the physical requirements of the producers <\s>
<s> in spinning very fine cotton thread englands natural climate gives in some parts of the country such advantages in proper moisture and electric conditions that the operation can be carried on out of doors while in the united states it is generally necessary to create an artificial atmosphere <\s>

<s> the full reasons for these facts are not yet ascertained <\s>
<s> experts in the woolen industry also explain that the quality and fiber of wool depend upon the soil and climate where the sheep are pastured <\s>

<s> the wool produced by one set of climatic conditions is quite different from that of another set and is used by the manufacturers for different purposes <\s>
<s> in hot regions mankind can exist in comfort with less perfect housing less clothing fuel that absolute necessary of life in cold climates they can almost dispense with except for industrial uses <\s>
<s> they also require less aliment <\s>
<s> among natural advantages besides soil and climate must be mentioned abundance of mineral productions in convenient situations and capable of being worked with moderate labor <\s>
<s> such are the coal fields of great britain which do so much to compensate its inhabitants for the disadvantages of climate and the scarcely inferior resource possessed by this country and the united states in a copious supply of an easily reduced iron ore at no great depth below the earths surface and in close proximity to coal deposits available for working it <\s>
<s> but perhaps a greater advantage than all these is a maritime situation especially when accompanied with good natural harbors and next to it great navigable rivers <\s>
<s> these advantages consist indeed wholly in saving of cost of carriage <\s>
<s> but few who have not considered the subject have any adequate notion how great an extent of economical advantage this comprises <\s>
<s> as the second of the general causes of superior productiveness we may rank the greater energy of labor <\s>
<s> by this is not to be understood occasional but regular and habitual energy <\s>

<s> independently of the effects of intemperance upon their bodily and mental faculties and of flighty unsteady habits upon the energy and continuity of their work points so easily understood as not to require being insisted upon it is well worthy of meditation how much of the aggregate effect of their labor depends on their trustworthiness <\s>

<s> in the enumeration of the circumstances which promote the productiveness of labor we have left one untouched which is co operation or the combined action of numbers <\s>
<s> of this great aid to production a single department known by the name of division of labor has engaged a large share of the attention of political economists most deservedly indeed but to the exclusion of other cases and exemplifications of the same comprehensive law <\s>
<s> in the lifting of heavy weights for example in the felling of trees in the sawing of timber in the gathering of much hay or corn during a short period of fine weather in draining a large extent of land during the short season when such a work may be properly conducted in the pulling of ropes on board ship in the rowing of large boats in some mining operations in the erection of a scaffolding for building and in the breaking of stones for the repair of a road so that the whole of the road shall always be kept in good order in all these simple operations and thousands more it is absolutely necessary that many persons should work together at the same time in the same place and in the same way <\s>
<s> but in the present state of society the breeding and feeding of sheep is the occupation of one set of people dressing the wool to prepare it for the spinner is that of another spinning it into thread of a third weaving the thread into broadcloth of a fourth dyeing the cloth of a fifth making it into a coat of a sixth without counting the multitude of carriers merchants factors and retailers put in requisition at the successive stages of this progress <\s>
<s> without some separation of employments very few things would be produced at all <\s>
<s> suppose a set of persons or a number of families all employed precisely in the same manner each family settled on a piece of its own land on which it grows by its labor the food required for its own sustenance and as there are no persons to buy any surplus produce where all are producers each family has to produce within itself whatever other articles it consumes <\s>

<s> there is no inconsistency between this doctrine and the proposition we before maintained 115 that a market for commodities does not constitute employment for labor <\s>

<s> but beyond simple food precarious too from the variations of the seasons coarse clothing and very imperfect lodging it would be scarcely possible that the family should produce anything more <\s>
<s> suppose that a company of artificers provided with tools and with food sufficient to maintain them for a year arrive in the country and establish themselves in the midst of the population <\s>
<s> these new settlers occupy themselves in producing articles of use or ornament adapted to the taste of a simple people and before their food is exhausted they have produced these in considerable quantity and are ready to exchange them for more food <\s>
<s> the economical position of the landed population is now most materially altered <\s>
<s> they have an opportunity given them of acquiring comforts and luxuries <\s>
<s> things which while they depended solely upon their own labor they never could have obtained because they could not have produced are now accessible to them if they can succeed in producing an additional quantity of food and necessaries <\s>
<s> they are thus incited to increase the productiveness of their industry <\s>
<s> the new settlers constitute what is called a market for surplus agricultural produce and their arrival has enriched the settlement not only by the manufactured articles which they produce but by the food which would not have been produced unless they had been there to consume it <\s>
<s> there is no inconsistency between this doctrine and the proposition we before maintained 115 that a market for commodities does not constitute employment for labor <\s>
<s> the labor of the agriculturists was already provided with employment they are not indebted to the demand of the new comers for being able to maintain themselves <\s>

<s> from these considerations it appears that a country will seldom have a productive agriculture unless it has a large town population or the only available substitute a large export trade in agricultural produce to supply a population elsewhere <\s>
<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>

<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>

<s> without some separation of employments very few things would be produced at all <\s>
<s> suppose a set of persons or a number of families all employed precisely in the same manner each family settled on a piece of its own land on which it grows by its labor the food required for its own sustenance and as there are no persons to buy any surplus produce where all are producers each family has to produce within itself whatever other articles it consumes <\s>
<s> in such circumstances if the soil was tolerably fertile and population did not tread too closely on the heels of subsistence there would be no doubt some kind of domestic manufactures clothing for the family might perhaps be spun and woven within it by the labor probably of the women a first step in the separation of employments ); and a dwelling of some sort would be erected and kept in repair by their united labor <\s>
<s> but beyond simple food precarious too from the variations of the seasons coarse clothing and very imperfect lodging it would be scarcely possible that the family should produce anything more <\s>
<s> suppose that a company of artificers provided with tools and with food sufficient to maintain them for a year arrive in the country and establish themselves in the midst of the population <\s>
<s> these new settlers occupy themselves in producing articles of use or ornament adapted to the taste of a simple people and before their food is exhausted they have produced these in considerable quantity and are ready to exchange them for more food <\s>
<s> the economical position of the landed population is now most materially altered <\s>
<s> they have an opportunity given them of acquiring comforts and luxuries <\s>
<s> things which while they depended solely upon their own labor they never could have obtained because they could not have produced are now accessible to them if they can succeed in producing an additional quantity of food and necessaries <\s>
<s> they are thus incited to increase the productiveness of their industry <\s>
<s> the new settlers constitute what is called a market for surplus agricultural produce and their arrival has enriched the settlement not only by the manufactured articles which they produce but by the food which would not have been produced unless they had been there to consume it <\s>
<s> there is no inconsistency between this doctrine and the proposition we before maintained 115 that a market for commodities does not constitute employment for labor <\s>
<s> the labor of the agriculturists was already provided with employment they are not indebted to the demand of the new comers for being able to maintain themselves <\s>
<s> what that demand does for them is to call their labor into increased vigor and efficiency to stimulate them by new motives to new exertions <\s>
<s> from these considerations it appears that a country will seldom have a productive agriculture unless it has a large town population or the only available substitute a large export trade in agricultural produce to supply a population elsewhere <\s>
<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>
<s> there are in a pound upward of four thousand pins of a middling size <\s>
<s> those ten persons therefore could make among them upward of forty eight thousand pins in a day <\s>
<s> each person therefore making a tenth part of forty eight thousand pins might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day <\s>
<s> but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day      3 <\s>
<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>
<s> the inventor of the power loom was a clergyman <\s>

<s> but beyond simple food precarious too from the variations of the seasons coarse clothing and very imperfect lodging it would be scarcely possible that the family should produce anything more <\s>

<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>
<s> there are in a pound upward of four thousand pins of a middling size <\s>
<s> those ten persons therefore could make among them upward of forty eight thousand pins in a day <\s>
<s> each person therefore making a tenth part of forty eight thousand pins might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day <\s>
<s> but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day      3 <\s>
<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>
<s> the inventor of the power loom was a clergyman <\s>
<s> a farmer devised the application of the screw propeller <\s>
<s> a fancy goods shopkeeper is one of the most enterprising experimentalists in agriculture <\s>
<s> the most remarkable architectural design of our day has been furnished by a gardener <\s>
<s> the first person who supplied london with water was a goldsmith <\s>
<s> the first extensive maker of english roads was a blind man bred to no trade <\s>
<s> the father of english inland navigation was a duke and his engineer was a millwright <\s>
<s> the first great builder of iron bridges was a stone mason and the greatest railway engineer commenced his life as a colliery engineer    117 4 the greatest advantage next to the dexterity of the workmen derived from the minute division of labor which takes place in modern manufacturing industry is one not mentioned by adam smith but to which attention has been drawn by mr <\s>
<s> babbage the more economical distribution of labor by classing the work people according to their capacity <\s>
<s> different parts of the same series of operations require unequal degrees of skill and bodily strength and those who have skill enough for the most difficult or strength enough for the hardest parts of the labor are made much more useful by being employed solely in them the operations which everybody is capable of being left to those who are fit for no others <\s>
<s> the division of labor as all writers on the subject have remarked is limited by the extent of the market <\s>
<s> if by the separation of pin making into ten distinct employments forty eight thousand pins can be made in a day this separation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers is such as to require every day something like forty eight thousand pins <\s>
<s> if there is only a demand for twenty four thousand the division of labor can only be advantageously carried to the extent which will every day produce that smaller number <\s>
<s> the increase of the general riches of the world when accompanied with freedom of commercial intercourse improvements in navigation and inland communication by roads canals or railways tends to give increased productiveness to the labor of every nation in particular by enabling each locality to supply with its special products so much larger a market that a great extension of the division of labor in their production is an ordinary consequence <\s>
<s> the division of labor is also limited in many cases by the nature of the employment <\s>
<s> agriculture for example is not susceptible of so great a division of occupations as many branches of manufactures because its different operations can not possibly be simultaneous <\s>

<s> without some separation of employments very few things would be produced at all <\s>
<s> suppose a set of persons or a number of families all employed precisely in the same manner each family settled on a piece of its own land on which it grows by its labor the food required for its own sustenance and as there are no persons to buy any surplus produce where all are producers each family has to produce within itself whatever other articles it consumes <\s>
<s> in such circumstances if the soil was tolerably fertile and population did not tread too closely on the heels of subsistence there would be no doubt some kind of domestic manufactures clothing for the family might perhaps be spun and woven within it by the labor probably of the women a first step in the separation of employments ); and a dwelling of some sort would be erected and kept in repair by their united labor <\s>
<s> but beyond simple food precarious too from the variations of the seasons coarse clothing and very imperfect lodging it would be scarcely possible that the family should produce anything more <\s>

<s> these new settlers occupy themselves in producing articles of use or ornament adapted to the taste of a simple people and before their food is exhausted they have produced these in considerable quantity and are ready to exchange them for more food <\s>

<s> they have an opportunity given them of acquiring comforts and luxuries <\s>
<s> things which while they depended solely upon their own labor they never could have obtained because they could not have produced are now accessible to them if they can succeed in producing an additional quantity of food and necessaries <\s>
<s> they are thus incited to increase the productiveness of their industry <\s>
<s> the new settlers constitute what is called a market for surplus agricultural produce and their arrival has enriched the settlement not only by the manufactured articles which they produce but by the food which would not have been produced unless they had been there to consume it <\s>
<s> there is no inconsistency between this doctrine and the proposition we before maintained 115 that a market for commodities does not constitute employment for labor <\s>

<s> from these considerations it appears that a country will seldom have a productive agriculture unless it has a large town population or the only available substitute a large export trade in agricultural produce to supply a population elsewhere <\s>
<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>
<s> there are in a pound upward of four thousand pins of a middling size <\s>
<s> those ten persons therefore could make among them upward of forty eight thousand pins in a day <\s>
<s> each person therefore making a tenth part of forty eight thousand pins might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day <\s>
<s> but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day      3 <\s>
<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>
<s> the inventor of the power loom was a clergyman <\s>
<s> a farmer devised the application of the screw propeller <\s>
<s> a fancy goods shopkeeper is one of the most enterprising experimentalists in agriculture <\s>
<s> the most remarkable architectural design of our day has been furnished by a gardener <\s>
<s> the first person who supplied london with water was a goldsmith <\s>
<s> the first extensive maker of english roads was a blind man bred to no trade <\s>
<s> the father of english inland navigation was a duke and his engineer was a millwright <\s>
<s> the first great builder of iron bridges was a stone mason and the greatest railway engineer commenced his life as a colliery engineer    117 4 the greatest advantage next to the dexterity of the workmen derived from the minute division of labor which takes place in modern manufacturing industry is one not mentioned by adam smith but to which attention has been drawn by mr <\s>
<s> babbage the more economical distribution of labor by classing the work people according to their capacity <\s>
<s> different parts of the same series of operations require unequal degrees of skill and bodily strength and those who have skill enough for the most difficult or strength enough for the hardest parts of the labor are made much more useful by being employed solely in them the operations which everybody is capable of being left to those who are fit for no others <\s>
<s> the division of labor as all writers on the subject have remarked is limited by the extent of the market <\s>
<s> if by the separation of pin making into ten distinct employments forty eight thousand pins can be made in a day this separation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers is such as to require every day something like forty eight thousand pins <\s>
<s> if there is only a demand for twenty four thousand the division of labor can only be advantageously carried to the extent which will every day produce that smaller number <\s>
<s> the increase of the general riches of the world when accompanied with freedom of commercial intercourse improvements in navigation and inland communication by roads canals or railways tends to give increased productiveness to the labor of every nation in particular by enabling each locality to supply with its special products so much larger a market that a great extension of the division of labor in their production is an ordinary consequence <\s>
<s> the division of labor is also limited in many cases by the nature of the employment <\s>
<s> agriculture for example is not susceptible of so great a division of occupations as many branches of manufactures because its different operations can not possibly be simultaneous <\s>
<s> 5    in the examples given above the advantage obtained was derived from the mere fact of the separation of employments altogether independently of the mode in which the separated employments were distributed among the persons carrying them on as well as of the places in which they were conducted <\s>
<s> but a further gain arises when the employments are of a kind which in order to their effective performance call for special capacities in the workman or special natural resources in the scene of operation <\s>
<s> there would be a manifest waste of special power in compelling to a mere mechanical or routine pursuit a man who is fitted to excel in a professional career and similarly if a branch of industry were established on some site which offered greater facilities to an industry of another sort a waste analogous in character would be incurred <\s>
<s> fertility of soil is one of the principal <\s>
<s> the influence of climate is another advantage and consists in lessening the physical requirements of the producers <\s>
<s> in spinning very fine cotton thread englands natural climate gives in some parts of the country such advantages in proper moisture and electric conditions that the operation can be carried on out of doors while in the united states it is generally necessary to create an artificial atmosphere <\s>
<s> in ordinary spinning in our country more is accomplished when the wind is in one quarter than in another <\s>
<s> the dry northwest wind in new england reduces the amount of product while the dry northeast wind in england has a similar effect and it is said has practically driven the cotton spinners from manchester to oldham where the climate is more equably moist <\s>
<s> the full reasons for these facts are not yet ascertained <\s>
<s> experts in the woolen industry also explain that the quality and fiber of wool depend upon the soil and climate where the sheep are pastured <\s>
<s> when ohio sheep are transferred to texas in a few years their wool loses the distinctive quality it formerly possessed and takes on a new character belonging to the breeds of texas <\s>
<s> the wool produced by one set of climatic conditions is quite different from that of another set and is used by the manufacturers for different purposes <\s>
<s> in hot regions mankind can exist in comfort with less perfect housing less clothing fuel that absolute necessary of life in cold climates they can almost dispense with except for industrial uses <\s>

<s> but beyond simple food precarious too from the variations of the seasons coarse clothing and very imperfect lodging it would be scarcely possible that the family should produce anything more <\s>

<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>
<s> there are in a pound upward of four thousand pins of a middling size <\s>
<s> those ten persons therefore could make among them upward of forty eight thousand pins in a day <\s>
<s> each person therefore making a tenth part of forty eight thousand pins might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day <\s>
<s> but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day      3 <\s>
<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>
<s> the inventor of the power loom was a clergyman <\s>
<s> a farmer devised the application of the screw propeller <\s>
<s> a fancy goods shopkeeper is one of the most enterprising experimentalists in agriculture <\s>
<s> the most remarkable architectural design of our day has been furnished by a gardener <\s>
<s> the first person who supplied london with water was a goldsmith <\s>
<s> the first extensive maker of english roads was a blind man bred to no trade <\s>
<s> the father of english inland navigation was a duke and his engineer was a millwright <\s>
<s> the first great builder of iron bridges was a stone mason and the greatest railway engineer commenced his life as a colliery engineer    117 4 the greatest advantage next to the dexterity of the workmen derived from the minute division of labor which takes place in modern manufacturing industry is one not mentioned by adam smith but to which attention has been drawn by mr <\s>
<s> babbage the more economical distribution of labor by classing the work people according to their capacity <\s>
<s> different parts of the same series of operations require unequal degrees of skill and bodily strength and those who have skill enough for the most difficult or strength enough for the hardest parts of the labor are made much more useful by being employed solely in them the operations which everybody is capable of being left to those who are fit for no others <\s>
<s> the division of labor as all writers on the subject have remarked is limited by the extent of the market <\s>
<s> if by the separation of pin making into ten distinct employments forty eight thousand pins can be made in a day this separation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers is such as to require every day something like forty eight thousand pins <\s>
<s> if there is only a demand for twenty four thousand the division of labor can only be advantageously carried to the extent which will every day produce that smaller number <\s>
<s> the increase of the general riches of the world when accompanied with freedom of commercial intercourse improvements in navigation and inland communication by roads canals or railways tends to give increased productiveness to the labor of every nation in particular by enabling each locality to supply with its special products so much larger a market that a great extension of the division of labor in their production is an ordinary consequence <\s>
<s> the division of labor is also limited in many cases by the nature of the employment <\s>
<s> agriculture for example is not susceptible of so great a division of occupations as many branches of manufactures because its different operations can not possibly be simultaneous <\s>
<s> 5    in the examples given above the advantage obtained was derived from the mere fact of the separation of employments altogether independently of the mode in which the separated employments were distributed among the persons carrying them on as well as of the places in which they were conducted <\s>
<s> but a further gain arises when the employments are of a kind which in order to their effective performance call for special capacities in the workman or special natural resources in the scene of operation <\s>
<s> there would be a manifest waste of special power in compelling to a mere mechanical or routine pursuit a man who is fitted to excel in a professional career and similarly if a branch of industry were established on some site which offered greater facilities to an industry of another sort a waste analogous in character would be incurred <\s>
<s> fertility of soil is one of the principal <\s>
<s> the influence of climate is another advantage and consists in lessening the physical requirements of the producers <\s>
<s> in spinning very fine cotton thread englands natural climate gives in some parts of the country such advantages in proper moisture and electric conditions that the operation can be carried on out of doors while in the united states it is generally necessary to create an artificial atmosphere <\s>
<s> in ordinary spinning in our country more is accomplished when the wind is in one quarter than in another <\s>
<s> the dry northwest wind in new england reduces the amount of product while the dry northeast wind in england has a similar effect and it is said has practically driven the cotton spinners from manchester to oldham where the climate is more equably moist <\s>
<s> the full reasons for these facts are not yet ascertained <\s>
<s> experts in the woolen industry also explain that the quality and fiber of wool depend upon the soil and climate where the sheep are pastured <\s>
<s> when ohio sheep are transferred to texas in a few years their wool loses the distinctive quality it formerly possessed and takes on a new character belonging to the breeds of texas <\s>
<s> the wool produced by one set of climatic conditions is quite different from that of another set and is used by the manufacturers for different purposes <\s>
<s> in hot regions mankind can exist in comfort with less perfect housing less clothing fuel that absolute necessary of life in cold climates they can almost dispense with except for industrial uses <\s>
<s> they also require less aliment <\s>
<s> among natural advantages besides soil and climate must be mentioned abundance of mineral productions in convenient situations and capable of being worked with moderate labor <\s>
<s> such are the coal fields of great britain which do so much to compensate its inhabitants for the disadvantages of climate and the scarcely inferior resource possessed by this country and the united states in a copious supply of an easily reduced iron ore at no great depth below the earths surface and in close proximity to coal deposits available for working it <\s>
<s> but perhaps a greater advantage than all these is a maritime situation especially when accompanied with good natural harbors and next to it great navigable rivers <\s>
<s> these advantages consist indeed wholly in saving of cost of carriage <\s>
<s> but few who have not considered the subject have any adequate notion how great an extent of economical advantage this comprises <\s>
<s> as the second of the general causes of superior productiveness we may rank the greater energy of labor <\s>
<s> by this is not to be understood occasional but regular and habitual energy <\s>
<s> the third element which determines the productiveness of the labor of a community is the skill and knowledge therein existing whether it be the skill and knowledge of the laborers themselves or of those who direct their labor <\s>
<s> that the productiveness of the labor of a people is limited by their knowledge of the arts of life is self evident and that any progress in those arts any improved application of the objects or powers of nature to industrial uses enables the same quantity and intensity of labor to raise a greater produce <\s>

<s> from these considerations it appears that a country will seldom have a productive agriculture unless it has a large town population or the only available substitute a large export trade in agricultural produce to supply a population elsewhere <\s>
<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>
<s> there are in a pound upward of four thousand pins of a middling size <\s>
<s> those ten persons therefore could make among them upward of forty eight thousand pins in a day <\s>
<s> each person therefore making a tenth part of forty eight thousand pins might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day <\s>
<s> but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day      3 <\s>
<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>
<s> the inventor of the power loom was a clergyman <\s>
<s> a farmer devised the application of the screw propeller <\s>
<s> a fancy goods shopkeeper is one of the most enterprising experimentalists in agriculture <\s>
<s> the most remarkable architectural design of our day has been furnished by a gardener <\s>
<s> the first person who supplied london with water was a goldsmith <\s>
<s> the first extensive maker of english roads was a blind man bred to no trade <\s>
<s> the father of english inland navigation was a duke and his engineer was a millwright <\s>
<s> the first great builder of iron bridges was a stone mason and the greatest railway engineer commenced his life as a colliery engineer    117 4 the greatest advantage next to the dexterity of the workmen derived from the minute division of labor which takes place in modern manufacturing industry is one not mentioned by adam smith but to which attention has been drawn by mr <\s>
<s> babbage the more economical distribution of labor by classing the work people according to their capacity <\s>
<s> different parts of the same series of operations require unequal degrees of skill and bodily strength and those who have skill enough for the most difficult or strength enough for the hardest parts of the labor are made much more useful by being employed solely in them the operations which everybody is capable of being left to those who are fit for no others <\s>
<s> the division of labor as all writers on the subject have remarked is limited by the extent of the market <\s>
<s> if by the separation of pin making into ten distinct employments forty eight thousand pins can be made in a day this separation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers is such as to require every day something like forty eight thousand pins <\s>
<s> if there is only a demand for twenty four thousand the division of labor can only be advantageously carried to the extent which will every day produce that smaller number <\s>
<s> the increase of the general riches of the world when accompanied with freedom of commercial intercourse improvements in navigation and inland communication by roads canals or railways tends to give increased productiveness to the labor of every nation in particular by enabling each locality to supply with its special products so much larger a market that a great extension of the division of labor in their production is an ordinary consequence <\s>
<s> the division of labor is also limited in many cases by the nature of the employment <\s>
<s> agriculture for example is not susceptible of so great a division of occupations as many branches of manufactures because its different operations can not possibly be simultaneous <\s>
<s> 5    in the examples given above the advantage obtained was derived from the mere fact of the separation of employments altogether independently of the mode in which the separated employments were distributed among the persons carrying them on as well as of the places in which they were conducted <\s>
<s> but a further gain arises when the employments are of a kind which in order to their effective performance call for special capacities in the workman or special natural resources in the scene of operation <\s>
<s> there would be a manifest waste of special power in compelling to a mere mechanical or routine pursuit a man who is fitted to excel in a professional career and similarly if a branch of industry were established on some site which offered greater facilities to an industry of another sort a waste analogous in character would be incurred <\s>
<s> fertility of soil is one of the principal <\s>
<s> the influence of climate is another advantage and consists in lessening the physical requirements of the producers <\s>
<s> in spinning very fine cotton thread englands natural climate gives in some parts of the country such advantages in proper moisture and electric conditions that the operation can be carried on out of doors while in the united states it is generally necessary to create an artificial atmosphere <\s>
<s> in ordinary spinning in our country more is accomplished when the wind is in one quarter than in another <\s>
<s> the dry northwest wind in new england reduces the amount of product while the dry northeast wind in england has a similar effect and it is said has practically driven the cotton spinners from manchester to oldham where the climate is more equably moist <\s>
<s> the full reasons for these facts are not yet ascertained <\s>
<s> experts in the woolen industry also explain that the quality and fiber of wool depend upon the soil and climate where the sheep are pastured <\s>
<s> when ohio sheep are transferred to texas in a few years their wool loses the distinctive quality it formerly possessed and takes on a new character belonging to the breeds of texas <\s>
<s> the wool produced by one set of climatic conditions is quite different from that of another set and is used by the manufacturers for different purposes <\s>
<s> in hot regions mankind can exist in comfort with less perfect housing less clothing fuel that absolute necessary of life in cold climates they can almost dispense with except for industrial uses <\s>
<s> they also require less aliment <\s>
<s> among natural advantages besides soil and climate must be mentioned abundance of mineral productions in convenient situations and capable of being worked with moderate labor <\s>
<s> such are the coal fields of great britain which do so much to compensate its inhabitants for the disadvantages of climate and the scarcely inferior resource possessed by this country and the united states in a copious supply of an easily reduced iron ore at no great depth below the earths surface and in close proximity to coal deposits available for working it <\s>
<s> but perhaps a greater advantage than all these is a maritime situation especially when accompanied with good natural harbors and next to it great navigable rivers <\s>
<s> these advantages consist indeed wholly in saving of cost of carriage <\s>
<s> but few who have not considered the subject have any adequate notion how great an extent of economical advantage this comprises <\s>
<s> as the second of the general causes of superior productiveness we may rank the greater energy of labor <\s>
<s> by this is not to be understood occasional but regular and habitual energy <\s>
<s> the third element which determines the productiveness of the labor of a community is the skill and knowledge therein existing whether it be the skill and knowledge of the laborers themselves or of those who direct their labor <\s>
<s> that the productiveness of the labor of a people is limited by their knowledge of the arts of life is self evident and that any progress in those arts any improved application of the objects or powers of nature to industrial uses enables the same quantity and intensity of labor to raise a greater produce <\s>
<s> one principal department of these improvements consists in the invention and use of tools and machinery 114 the deficiency of practical good sense which renders the majority of the laboring class such bad calculatorswhich makes for instance their domestic economy so improvident lax and irregularmust disqualify them for any but a low grade of intelligent labor and render their industry far less productive than with equal energy it otherwise might be <\s>
<s> the moral qualities of the laborers are fully as important to the efficiency and worth of their labor as the intellectual <\s>
<s> independently of the effects of intemperance upon their bodily and mental faculties and of flighty unsteady habits upon the energy and continuity of their work points so easily understood as not to require being insisted upon it is well worthy of meditation how much of the aggregate effect of their labor depends on their trustworthiness <\s>
<s> among the secondary causes which determine the productiveness of productive agents the most important is security <\s>
<s> by security i mean the completeness of the protection which society affords to its members <\s>
<s> combination and division of labor increase productiveness <\s>
<s> in the enumeration of the circumstances which promote the productiveness of labor we have left one untouched which is co operation or the combined action of numbers <\s>
<s> of this great aid to production a single department known by the name of division of labor has engaged a large share of the attention of political economists most deservedly indeed but to the exclusion of other cases and exemplifications of the same comprehensive law <\s>
<s> in the lifting of heavy weights for example in the felling of trees in the sawing of timber in the gathering of much hay or corn during a short period of fine weather in draining a large extent of land during the short season when such a work may be properly conducted in the pulling of ropes on board ship in the rowing of large boats in some mining operations in the erection of a scaffolding for building and in the breaking of stones for the repair of a road so that the whole of the road shall always be kept in good order in all these simple operations and thousands more it is absolutely necessary that many persons should work together at the same time in the same place and in the same way <\s>

<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>

<s> the father of english inland navigation was a duke and his engineer was a millwright <\s>
<s> the first great builder of iron bridges was a stone mason and the greatest railway engineer commenced his life as a colliery engineer    117 4 the greatest advantage next to the dexterity of the workmen derived from the minute division of labor which takes place in modern manufacturing industry is one not mentioned by adam smith but to which attention has been drawn by mr <\s>
<s> babbage the more economical distribution of labor by classing the work people according to their capacity <\s>
<s> different parts of the same series of operations require unequal degrees of skill and bodily strength and those who have skill enough for the most difficult or strength enough for the hardest parts of the labor are made much more useful by being employed solely in them the operations which everybody is capable of being left to those who are fit for no others <\s>
<s> the division of labor as all writers on the subject have remarked is limited by the extent of the market <\s>
<s> if by the separation of pin making into ten distinct employments forty eight thousand pins can be made in a day this separation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers is such as to require every day something like forty eight thousand pins <\s>
<s> if there is only a demand for twenty four thousand the division of labor can only be advantageously carried to the extent which will every day produce that smaller number <\s>
<s> the increase of the general riches of the world when accompanied with freedom of commercial intercourse improvements in navigation and inland communication by roads canals or railways tends to give increased productiveness to the labor of every nation in particular by enabling each locality to supply with its special products so much larger a market that a great extension of the division of labor in their production is an ordinary consequence <\s>
<s> the division of labor is also limited in many cases by the nature of the employment <\s>
<s> agriculture for example is not susceptible of so great a division of occupations as many branches of manufactures because its different operations can not possibly be simultaneous <\s>
<s> 5    in the examples given above the advantage obtained was derived from the mere fact of the separation of employments altogether independently of the mode in which the separated employments were distributed among the persons carrying them on as well as of the places in which they were conducted <\s>
<s> but a further gain arises when the employments are of a kind which in order to their effective performance call for special capacities in the workman or special natural resources in the scene of operation <\s>
<s> there would be a manifest waste of special power in compelling to a mere mechanical or routine pursuit a man who is fitted to excel in a professional career and similarly if a branch of industry were established on some site which offered greater facilities to an industry of another sort a waste analogous in character would be incurred <\s>
<s> fertility of soil is one of the principal <\s>
<s> the influence of climate is another advantage and consists in lessening the physical requirements of the producers <\s>
<s> in spinning very fine cotton thread englands natural climate gives in some parts of the country such advantages in proper moisture and electric conditions that the operation can be carried on out of doors while in the united states it is generally necessary to create an artificial atmosphere <\s>

<s> the full reasons for these facts are not yet ascertained <\s>
<s> experts in the woolen industry also explain that the quality and fiber of wool depend upon the soil and climate where the sheep are pastured <\s>

<s> the wool produced by one set of climatic conditions is quite different from that of another set and is used by the manufacturers for different purposes <\s>
<s> in hot regions mankind can exist in comfort with less perfect housing less clothing fuel that absolute necessary of life in cold climates they can almost dispense with except for industrial uses <\s>
<s> they also require less aliment <\s>
<s> among natural advantages besides soil and climate must be mentioned abundance of mineral productions in convenient situations and capable of being worked with moderate labor <\s>
<s> such are the coal fields of great britain which do so much to compensate its inhabitants for the disadvantages of climate and the scarcely inferior resource possessed by this country and the united states in a copious supply of an easily reduced iron ore at no great depth below the earths surface and in close proximity to coal deposits available for working it <\s>
<s> but perhaps a greater advantage than all these is a maritime situation especially when accompanied with good natural harbors and next to it great navigable rivers <\s>
<s> these advantages consist indeed wholly in saving of cost of carriage <\s>
<s> but few who have not considered the subject have any adequate notion how great an extent of economical advantage this comprises <\s>
<s> as the second of the general causes of superior productiveness we may rank the greater energy of labor <\s>
<s> by this is not to be understood occasional but regular and habitual energy <\s>

<s> independently of the effects of intemperance upon their bodily and mental faculties and of flighty unsteady habits upon the energy and continuity of their work points so easily understood as not to require being insisted upon it is well worthy of meditation how much of the aggregate effect of their labor depends on their trustworthiness <\s>

<s> in the enumeration of the circumstances which promote the productiveness of labor we have left one untouched which is co operation or the combined action of numbers <\s>
<s> of this great aid to production a single department known by the name of division of labor has engaged a large share of the attention of political economists most deservedly indeed but to the exclusion of other cases and exemplifications of the same comprehensive law <\s>
<s> in the lifting of heavy weights for example in the felling of trees in the sawing of timber in the gathering of much hay or corn during a short period of fine weather in draining a large extent of land during the short season when such a work may be properly conducted in the pulling of ropes on board ship in the rowing of large boats in some mining operations in the erection of a scaffolding for building and in the breaking of stones for the repair of a road so that the whole of the road shall always be kept in good order in all these simple operations and thousands more it is absolutely necessary that many persons should work together at the same time in the same place and in the same way <\s>
<s> but in the present state of society the breeding and feeding of sheep is the occupation of one set of people dressing the wool to prepare it for the spinner is that of another spinning it into thread of a third weaving the thread into broadcloth of a fourth dyeing the cloth of a fifth making it into a coat of a sixth without counting the multitude of carriers merchants factors and retailers put in requisition at the successive stages of this progress <\s>
<s> without some separation of employments very few things would be produced at all <\s>
<s> suppose a set of persons or a number of families all employed precisely in the same manner each family settled on a piece of its own land on which it grows by its labor the food required for its own sustenance and as there are no persons to buy any surplus produce where all are producers each family has to produce within itself whatever other articles it consumes <\s>

<s> there is no inconsistency between this doctrine and the proposition we before maintained 115 that a market for commodities does not constitute employment for labor <\s>

<s> but beyond simple food precarious too from the variations of the seasons coarse clothing and very imperfect lodging it would be scarcely possible that the family should produce anything more <\s>
<s> suppose that a company of artificers provided with tools and with food sufficient to maintain them for a year arrive in the country and establish themselves in the midst of the population <\s>
<s> these new settlers occupy themselves in producing articles of use or ornament adapted to the taste of a simple people and before their food is exhausted they have produced these in considerable quantity and are ready to exchange them for more food <\s>
<s> the economical position of the landed population is now most materially altered <\s>
<s> they have an opportunity given them of acquiring comforts and luxuries <\s>
<s> things which while they depended solely upon their own labor they never could have obtained because they could not have produced are now accessible to them if they can succeed in producing an additional quantity of food and necessaries <\s>
<s> they are thus incited to increase the productiveness of their industry <\s>
<s> the new settlers constitute what is called a market for surplus agricultural produce and their arrival has enriched the settlement not only by the manufactured articles which they produce but by the food which would not have been produced unless they had been there to consume it <\s>
<s> there is no inconsistency between this doctrine and the proposition we before maintained 115 that a market for commodities does not constitute employment for labor <\s>
<s> the labor of the agriculturists was already provided with employment they are not indebted to the demand of the new comers for being able to maintain themselves <\s>

<s> from these considerations it appears that a country will seldom have a productive agriculture unless it has a large town population or the only available substitute a large export trade in agricultural produce to supply a population elsewhere <\s>
<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>

<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>

<s> without some separation of employments very few things would be produced at all <\s>
<s> suppose a set of persons or a number of families all employed precisely in the same manner each family settled on a piece of its own land on which it grows by its labor the food required for its own sustenance and as there are no persons to buy any surplus produce where all are producers each family has to produce within itself whatever other articles it consumes <\s>
<s> in such circumstances if the soil was tolerably fertile and population did not tread too closely on the heels of subsistence there would be no doubt some kind of domestic manufactures clothing for the family might perhaps be spun and woven within it by the labor probably of the women a first step in the separation of employments ); and a dwelling of some sort would be erected and kept in repair by their united labor <\s>
<s> but beyond simple food precarious too from the variations of the seasons coarse clothing and very imperfect lodging it would be scarcely possible that the family should produce anything more <\s>
<s> suppose that a company of artificers provided with tools and with food sufficient to maintain them for a year arrive in the country and establish themselves in the midst of the population <\s>
<s> these new settlers occupy themselves in producing articles of use or ornament adapted to the taste of a simple people and before their food is exhausted they have produced these in considerable quantity and are ready to exchange them for more food <\s>
<s> the economical position of the landed population is now most materially altered <\s>
<s> they have an opportunity given them of acquiring comforts and luxuries <\s>
<s> things which while they depended solely upon their own labor they never could have obtained because they could not have produced are now accessible to them if they can succeed in producing an additional quantity of food and necessaries <\s>
<s> they are thus incited to increase the productiveness of their industry <\s>
<s> the new settlers constitute what is called a market for surplus agricultural produce and their arrival has enriched the settlement not only by the manufactured articles which they produce but by the food which would not have been produced unless they had been there to consume it <\s>
<s> there is no inconsistency between this doctrine and the proposition we before maintained 115 that a market for commodities does not constitute employment for labor <\s>
<s> the labor of the agriculturists was already provided with employment they are not indebted to the demand of the new comers for being able to maintain themselves <\s>
<s> what that demand does for them is to call their labor into increased vigor and efficiency to stimulate them by new motives to new exertions <\s>
<s> from these considerations it appears that a country will seldom have a productive agriculture unless it has a large town population or the only available substitute a large export trade in agricultural produce to supply a population elsewhere <\s>
<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>
<s> there are in a pound upward of four thousand pins of a middling size <\s>
<s> those ten persons therefore could make among them upward of forty eight thousand pins in a day <\s>
<s> each person therefore making a tenth part of forty eight thousand pins might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day <\s>
<s> but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day      3 <\s>
<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>
<s> the inventor of the power loom was a clergyman <\s>

<s> but beyond simple food precarious too from the variations of the seasons coarse clothing and very imperfect lodging it would be scarcely possible that the family should produce anything more <\s>

<s> i use the phrase    town population    for shortness to imply a population non agricultural <\s>
<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>
<s> there are in a pound upward of four thousand pins of a middling size <\s>
<s> those ten persons therefore could make among them upward of forty eight thousand pins in a day <\s>
<s> each person therefore making a tenth part of forty eight thousand pins might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day <\s>
<s> but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day      3 <\s>
<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>
<s> the inventor of the power loom was a clergyman <\s>
<s> a farmer devised the application of the screw propeller <\s>
<s> a fancy goods shopkeeper is one of the most enterprising experimentalists in agriculture <\s>
<s> the most remarkable architectural design of our day has been furnished by a gardener <\s>
<s> the first person who supplied london with water was a goldsmith <\s>
<s> the first extensive maker of english roads was a blind man bred to no trade <\s>
<s> the father of english inland navigation was a duke and his engineer was a millwright <\s>
<s> the first great builder of iron bridges was a stone mason and the greatest railway engineer commenced his life as a colliery engineer    117 4 the greatest advantage next to the dexterity of the workmen derived from the minute division of labor which takes place in modern manufacturing industry is one not mentioned by adam smith but to which attention has been drawn by mr <\s>
<s> babbage the more economical distribution of labor by classing the work people according to their capacity <\s>
<s> different parts of the same series of operations require unequal degrees of skill and bodily strength and those who have skill enough for the most difficult or strength enough for the hardest parts of the labor are made much more useful by being employed solely in them the operations which everybody is capable of being left to those who are fit for no others <\s>
<s> the division of labor as all writers on the subject have remarked is limited by the extent of the market <\s>
<s> if by the separation of pin making into ten distinct employments forty eight thousand pins can be made in a day this separation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers is such as to require every day something like forty eight thousand pins <\s>
<s> if there is only a demand for twenty four thousand the division of labor can only be advantageously carried to the extent which will every day produce that smaller number <\s>
<s> the increase of the general riches of the world when accompanied with freedom of commercial intercourse improvements in navigation and inland communication by roads canals or railways tends to give increased productiveness to the labor of every nation in particular by enabling each locality to supply with its special products so much larger a market that a great extension of the division of labor in their production is an ordinary consequence <\s>
<s> the division of labor is also limited in many cases by the nature of the employment <\s>
<s> agriculture for example is not susceptible of so great a division of occupations as many branches of manufactures because its different operations can not possibly be simultaneous <\s>

<s> it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations <\s>
<s> and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar <\s>
<s> adam smiths illustration from pin making though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it    the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations <\s>
<s> one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper .... <\s>
<s> i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations <\s>
<s> but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day <\s>

<s> but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day      3 <\s>
<s> advantages of division of labor <\s>
<s> the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them <\s>
<s> by adam smith they are reduced to three    first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many    1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal <\s>
<s> it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better <\s>
<s> that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands <\s>
<s> but it will be done more easily <\s>
<s> this is as true of mental operations as of bodily <\s>
<s> even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition <\s>
<s> the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar <\s>
<s> among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition <\s>
<s> in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced <\s>
<s> 2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves <\s>
<s> to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it    it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools <\s>
<s> a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom <\s>
<s> when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less <\s>
<s> it is even in this case however very considerable <\s>
<s> a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another    i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counter considerations which are overlooked <\s>
<s> if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy <\s>
<s> it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one 116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work <\s>
<s> bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely <\s>
<s> the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spiritsso important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that <\s>
<s> 3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real <\s>
<s> inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it <\s>
<s> this also can not be wholly true <\s>
<s>    the founder of the cotton manufacture was a barber <\s>
<s> the inventor of the power loom was a clergyman <\s>
<s> a farmer devised the application of the screw propeller <\s>
<s> a fancy goods shopkeeper is one of the most enterprising experimentalists in agriculture <\s>
<s> the most remarkable architectural design of our day has been furnished by a gardener <\s>
<s> the first person who supplied london with water was a goldsmith <\s>
<s> the first extensive maker of english roads was a blind man bred to no trade <\s>
<s> the father of english inland navigation was a duke and his engineer was a millwright <\s>
<s> the first great builder of iron bridges was a stone mason and the greatest railway engineer commenced his life as a colliery engineer    117 4 the greatest advantage next to the dexterity of the workmen derived from the minute division of labor which takes place in modern manufacturing industry is one not mentioned by adam smith but to which attention has been drawn by mr <\s>
<s> babbage the more economical distribution of labor by classing the work people according to their capacity <\s>
<s> different parts of the same series of operations require unequal degrees of skill and bodily strength and those who have skill enough for the most difficult or strength enough for the hardest parts of the labor are made much more useful by being employed solely in them the operations which everybody is capable of being left to those who are fit for no others <\s>
<s> the division of labor as all writers on the subject have remarked is limited by the extent of the market <\s>
<s> if by the separation of pin making into ten distinct employments forty eight thousand pins can be made in a day this separation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers is such as to require every day something like forty eight thousand pins <\s>
<s> if there is only a demand for twenty four thousand the division of labor can only be advantageously carried to the extent which will every day produce that smaller number <\s>
<s> the increase of the general riches of the world when accompanied with freedom of commercial intercourse improvements in navigation and inland communication by roads canals or railways tends to give increased productiveness to the labor of every nation in particular by enabling each locality to supply with its special products so much larger a market that a great extension of the division of labor in their production is an ordinary consequence <\s>
<s> the division of labor is also limited in many cases by the nature of the employment <\s>
<s> agriculture for example is not susceptible of so great a division of occupations as many branches of manufactures because its different operations can not possibly be simultaneous <\s>
<s> 5    in the examples given above the advantage obtained was derived from the mere fact of the separation of employments altogether independently of the mode in which the separated employments were distributed among the persons carrying them on as well as of the places in which they were conducted <\s>
<s> but a further gain arises when the employments are of a kind which in order to their effective performance call for special capacities in the workman or special natural resources in the scene of operation <\s>
<s> there would be a manifest waste of special power in compelling to a mere mechanical or routine pursuit a man who is fitted to excel in a professional career and similarly if a branch of industry were established on some site which offered greater facilities to an industry of another sort a waste analogous in character would be incurred <\s>
<s> fertility of soil is one of the principal <\s>
<s> the influence of climate is another advantage and consists in lessening the physical requirements of the producers <\s>
<s> in spinning very fine cotton thread englands natural climate gives in some parts of the country such advantages in proper moisture and electric conditions that the operation can be carried on out of doors while in the united states it is generally necessary to create an artificial atmosphere <\s>
<s> in ordinary spinning in our country more is accomplished when the wind is in one quarter than in another <\s>
<s> the dry northwest wind in new england reduces the amount of product while the dry northeast wind in england has a similar effect and it is said has practically driven the cotton spinners from manchester to oldham where the climate is more equably moist <\s>
<s> the full reasons for these facts are not yet ascertained <\s>
<s> experts in the woolen industry also explain that the quality and fiber of wool depend upon the soil and climate where the sheep are pastured <\s>
<s> when ohio sheep are transferred to texas in a few years their wool loses the distinctive quality it formerly possessed and takes on a new character belonging to the breeds of texas <\s>
<s> the wool produced by one set of climatic conditions is quite different from that of another set and is used by the manufacturers for different purposes <\s>

<s> the geographical causes which have made industry rather than war the natural source of power and importance to great britain and the united states have turned an unusual proportion of the most enterprising and energetic characters into the direction of manufactures and commerce into supplying their wants and gratifying their ambition by producing and saving rather than by appropriating what has been produced and saved <\s>
<s> much also depended on the better political institutions of this country which by the scope they have allowed to individual freedom of action have encouraged personal activity and self reliance while by the liberty they confer of association and combination they facilitate industrial enterprise on a large scale <\s>

<s> the earlier decline of feudalism in england having removed or much weakened invidious distinctions between the originally trading classes and those who had been accustomed to despise them and a polity having grown up which made wealth the real source of political influence its acquisition was invested with a factitious value independent of its intrinsic utility <\s>

<s> its extent is limited and the extent of the more productive kinds of it more limited still <\s>
<s> it is also evident that the quantity of produce capable of being raised on any given piece of land is not indefinite <\s>
<s> this limited quantity of land and limited productiveness of it are the real limits to the increase of production <\s>
<s> the limitation to production from the properties of the soil is not like the obstacle opposed by a wall which stands immovable in one particular spot and offers no hindrance to motion short of stopping it entirely <\s>
<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>
<s> it seems however that this process of reduction culminated about 1879 <\s>

<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>

<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

<s> the united states also escapes from the heavy taxation which in europe is imposed to maintain an extravagant army and navy chest <\s>
<s> the effect of institutions moreover in stimulating the growth of material prosperity is far more true of the united states than of england for the barriers raised against the movement from lower to higher social classes in the latter country are non existent here and consequently there is more stimulus toward acquiring the means of bettering a mans social condition <\s>
<s> the geographical causes which have made industry rather than war the natural source of power and importance to great britain and the united states have turned an unusual proportion of the most enterprising and energetic characters into the direction of manufactures and commerce into supplying their wants and gratifying their ambition by producing and saving rather than by appropriating what has been produced and saved <\s>
<s> much also depended on the better political institutions of this country which by the scope they have allowed to individual freedom of action have encouraged personal activity and self reliance while by the liberty they confer of association and combination they facilitate industrial enterprise on a large scale <\s>
<s> the same institutions in another of their aspects give a most direct and potent stimulus to the desire of acquiring wealth <\s>
<s> the earlier decline of feudalism in england having removed or much weakened invidious distinctions between the originally trading classes and those who had been accustomed to despise them and a polity having grown up which made wealth the real source of political influence its acquisition was invested with a factitious value independent of its intrinsic utility <\s>
<s> and inasmuch as to be rich without industry has always hitherto constituted a step in the social scale above those who are rich by means of industry it becomes the object of ambition to save not merely as much as will afford a large income while in business but enough to retire from business and live in affluence on realized gains <\s>
<s> in the united states england and holland then for a long time past and now in most other countries in europe the second requisite of increased production increase of capital shows no tendency to become deficient <\s>
<s> so far as that element is concerned production is susceptible of an increase without any assignable bounds <\s>
<s> the limitation to production not consisting in any necessary limit to the increase of the other two elements labor and capital must turn upon the properties of the only element which is inherently and in itself limited in quantity <\s>
<s> it must depend on the properties of land <\s>
<s> of the law of the increase of production from land <\s>
<s> the law of production from the soil a law of diminishing return in proportion to the increased application of labor and capital <\s>
<s> land differs from the other elements of production labor and capital in not being susceptible of indefinite increase <\s>
<s> its extent is limited and the extent of the more productive kinds of it more limited still <\s>
<s> it is also evident that the quantity of produce capable of being raised on any given piece of land is not indefinite <\s>
<s> this limited quantity of land and limited productiveness of it are the real limits to the increase of production <\s>
<s> the limitation to production from the properties of the soil is not like the obstacle opposed by a wall which stands immovable in one particular spot and offers no hindrance to motion short of stopping it entirely <\s>
<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>

<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

<s> the geographical causes which have made industry rather than war the natural source of power and importance to great britain and the united states have turned an unusual proportion of the most enterprising and energetic characters into the direction of manufactures and commerce into supplying their wants and gratifying their ambition by producing and saving rather than by appropriating what has been produced and saved <\s>
<s> much also depended on the better political institutions of this country which by the scope they have allowed to individual freedom of action have encouraged personal activity and self reliance while by the liberty they confer of association and combination they facilitate industrial enterprise on a large scale <\s>
<s> the same institutions in another of their aspects give a most direct and potent stimulus to the desire of acquiring wealth <\s>

<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>
<s> it seems however that this process of reduction culminated about 1879 <\s>
<s> in order to show the facts of this process note the changes in the following chart no <\s>
<s> the railways of the state of new york are taken but the same is also true of those of ohio chart v <\s>

<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>

<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

<s> the geographical causes which have made industry rather than war the natural source of power and importance to great britain and the united states have turned an unusual proportion of the most enterprising and energetic characters into the direction of manufactures and commerce into supplying their wants and gratifying their ambition by producing and saving rather than by appropriating what has been produced and saved <\s>
<s> much also depended on the better political institutions of this country which by the scope they have allowed to individual freedom of action have encouraged personal activity and self reliance while by the liberty they confer of association and combination they facilitate industrial enterprise on a large scale <\s>
<s> the same institutions in another of their aspects give a most direct and potent stimulus to the desire of acquiring wealth <\s>
<s> the earlier decline of feudalism in england having removed or much weakened invidious distinctions between the originally trading classes and those who had been accustomed to despise them and a polity having grown up which made wealth the real source of political influence its acquisition was invested with a factitious value independent of its intrinsic utility <\s>
<s> and inasmuch as to be rich without industry has always hitherto constituted a step in the social scale above those who are rich by means of industry it becomes the object of ambition to save not merely as much as will afford a large income while in business but enough to retire from business and live in affluence on realized gains <\s>
<s> in the united states england and holland then for a long time past and now in most other countries in europe the second requisite of increased production increase of capital shows no tendency to become deficient <\s>
<s> so far as that element is concerned production is susceptible of an increase without any assignable bounds <\s>
<s> the limitation to production not consisting in any necessary limit to the increase of the other two elements labor and capital must turn upon the properties of the only element which is inherently and in itself limited in quantity <\s>
<s> it must depend on the properties of land <\s>
<s> of the law of the increase of production from land <\s>
<s> the law of production from the soil a law of diminishing return in proportion to the increased application of labor and capital <\s>
<s> land differs from the other elements of production labor and capital in not being susceptible of indefinite increase <\s>
<s> its extent is limited and the extent of the more productive kinds of it more limited still <\s>
<s> it is also evident that the quantity of produce capable of being raised on any given piece of land is not indefinite <\s>
<s> this limited quantity of land and limited productiveness of it are the real limits to the increase of production <\s>
<s> the limitation to production from the properties of the soil is not like the obstacle opposed by a wall which stands immovable in one particular spot and offers no hindrance to motion short of stopping it entirely <\s>
<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>

<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

<s> but in the united states the same growth is seen as among the english <\s>

<s> the united states also escapes from the heavy taxation which in europe is imposed to maintain an extravagant army and navy chest <\s>
<s> the effect of institutions moreover in stimulating the growth of material prosperity is far more true of the united states than of england for the barriers raised against the movement from lower to higher social classes in the latter country are non existent here and consequently there is more stimulus toward acquiring the means of bettering a mans social condition <\s>
<s> the geographical causes which have made industry rather than war the natural source of power and importance to great britain and the united states have turned an unusual proportion of the most enterprising and energetic characters into the direction of manufactures and commerce into supplying their wants and gratifying their ambition by producing and saving rather than by appropriating what has been produced and saved <\s>
<s> much also depended on the better political institutions of this country which by the scope they have allowed to individual freedom of action have encouraged personal activity and self reliance while by the liberty they confer of association and combination they facilitate industrial enterprise on a large scale <\s>
<s> the same institutions in another of their aspects give a most direct and potent stimulus to the desire of acquiring wealth <\s>
<s> the earlier decline of feudalism in england having removed or much weakened invidious distinctions between the originally trading classes and those who had been accustomed to despise them and a polity having grown up which made wealth the real source of political influence its acquisition was invested with a factitious value independent of its intrinsic utility <\s>
<s> and inasmuch as to be rich without industry has always hitherto constituted a step in the social scale above those who are rich by means of industry it becomes the object of ambition to save not merely as much as will afford a large income while in business but enough to retire from business and live in affluence on realized gains <\s>
<s> in the united states england and holland then for a long time past and now in most other countries in europe the second requisite of increased production increase of capital shows no tendency to become deficient <\s>
<s> so far as that element is concerned production is susceptible of an increase without any assignable bounds <\s>
<s> the limitation to production not consisting in any necessary limit to the increase of the other two elements labor and capital must turn upon the properties of the only element which is inherently and in itself limited in quantity <\s>
<s> it must depend on the properties of land <\s>
<s> of the law of the increase of production from land <\s>
<s> the law of production from the soil a law of diminishing return in proportion to the increased application of labor and capital <\s>
<s> land differs from the other elements of production labor and capital in not being susceptible of indefinite increase <\s>
<s> its extent is limited and the extent of the more productive kinds of it more limited still <\s>
<s> it is also evident that the quantity of produce capable of being raised on any given piece of land is not indefinite <\s>
<s> this limited quantity of land and limited productiveness of it are the real limits to the increase of production <\s>
<s> the limitation to production from the properties of the soil is not like the obstacle opposed by a wall which stands immovable in one particular spot and offers no hindrance to motion short of stopping it entirely <\s>
<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>

<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>

<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>

<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>

<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

<s> the geographical causes which have made industry rather than war the natural source of power and importance to great britain and the united states have turned an unusual proportion of the most enterprising and energetic characters into the direction of manufactures and commerce into supplying their wants and gratifying their ambition by producing and saving rather than by appropriating what has been produced and saved <\s>
<s> much also depended on the better political institutions of this country which by the scope they have allowed to individual freedom of action have encouraged personal activity and self reliance while by the liberty they confer of association and combination they facilitate industrial enterprise on a large scale <\s>
<s> the same institutions in another of their aspects give a most direct and potent stimulus to the desire of acquiring wealth <\s>
<s> the earlier decline of feudalism in england having removed or much weakened invidious distinctions between the originally trading classes and those who had been accustomed to despise them and a polity having grown up which made wealth the real source of political influence its acquisition was invested with a factitious value independent of its intrinsic utility <\s>
<s> and inasmuch as to be rich without industry has always hitherto constituted a step in the social scale above those who are rich by means of industry it becomes the object of ambition to save not merely as much as will afford a large income while in business but enough to retire from business and live in affluence on realized gains <\s>
<s> in the united states england and holland then for a long time past and now in most other countries in europe the second requisite of increased production increase of capital shows no tendency to become deficient <\s>
<s> so far as that element is concerned production is susceptible of an increase without any assignable bounds <\s>

<s> of the law of the increase of production from land <\s>
<s> the law of production from the soil a law of diminishing return in proportion to the increased application of labor and capital <\s>
<s> land differs from the other elements of production labor and capital in not being susceptible of indefinite increase <\s>
<s> its extent is limited and the extent of the more productive kinds of it more limited still <\s>
<s> it is also evident that the quantity of produce capable of being raised on any given piece of land is not indefinite <\s>
<s> this limited quantity of land and limited productiveness of it are the real limits to the increase of production <\s>
<s> the limitation to production from the properties of the soil is not like the obstacle opposed by a wall which stands immovable in one particular spot and offers no hindrance to motion short of stopping it entirely <\s>
<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>

<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

<s> but in the united states the same growth is seen as among the english <\s>
<s> the net deposits of the national banks of the united states in 1871 were 636,000 000 but in 1883 they had increased more than 83 per cent to 1,168 000,000 <\s>

<s> the united states also escapes from the heavy taxation which in europe is imposed to maintain an extravagant army and navy chest <\s>
<s> the effect of institutions moreover in stimulating the growth of material prosperity is far more true of the united states than of england for the barriers raised against the movement from lower to higher social classes in the latter country are non existent here and consequently there is more stimulus toward acquiring the means of bettering a mans social condition <\s>
<s> the geographical causes which have made industry rather than war the natural source of power and importance to great britain and the united states have turned an unusual proportion of the most enterprising and energetic characters into the direction of manufactures and commerce into supplying their wants and gratifying their ambition by producing and saving rather than by appropriating what has been produced and saved <\s>
<s> much also depended on the better political institutions of this country which by the scope they have allowed to individual freedom of action have encouraged personal activity and self reliance while by the liberty they confer of association and combination they facilitate industrial enterprise on a large scale <\s>
<s> the same institutions in another of their aspects give a most direct and potent stimulus to the desire of acquiring wealth <\s>
<s> the earlier decline of feudalism in england having removed or much weakened invidious distinctions between the originally trading classes and those who had been accustomed to despise them and a polity having grown up which made wealth the real source of political influence its acquisition was invested with a factitious value independent of its intrinsic utility <\s>
<s> and inasmuch as to be rich without industry has always hitherto constituted a step in the social scale above those who are rich by means of industry it becomes the object of ambition to save not merely as much as will afford a large income while in business but enough to retire from business and live in affluence on realized gains <\s>
<s> in the united states england and holland then for a long time past and now in most other countries in europe the second requisite of increased production increase of capital shows no tendency to become deficient <\s>
<s> so far as that element is concerned production is susceptible of an increase without any assignable bounds <\s>
<s> the limitation to production not consisting in any necessary limit to the increase of the other two elements labor and capital must turn upon the properties of the only element which is inherently and in itself limited in quantity <\s>
<s> it must depend on the properties of land <\s>
<s> of the law of the increase of production from land <\s>
<s> the law of production from the soil a law of diminishing return in proportion to the increased application of labor and capital <\s>
<s> land differs from the other elements of production labor and capital in not being susceptible of indefinite increase <\s>
<s> its extent is limited and the extent of the more productive kinds of it more limited still <\s>
<s> it is also evident that the quantity of produce capable of being raised on any given piece of land is not indefinite <\s>
<s> this limited quantity of land and limited productiveness of it are the real limits to the increase of production <\s>
<s> the limitation to production from the properties of the soil is not like the obstacle opposed by a wall which stands immovable in one particular spot and offers no hindrance to motion short of stopping it entirely <\s>
<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>

<s> the geographical causes which have made industry rather than war the natural source of power and importance to great britain and the united states have turned an unusual proportion of the most enterprising and energetic characters into the direction of manufactures and commerce into supplying their wants and gratifying their ambition by producing and saving rather than by appropriating what has been produced and saved <\s>
<s> much also depended on the better political institutions of this country which by the scope they have allowed to individual freedom of action have encouraged personal activity and self reliance while by the liberty they confer of association and combination they facilitate industrial enterprise on a large scale <\s>

<s> the earlier decline of feudalism in england having removed or much weakened invidious distinctions between the originally trading classes and those who had been accustomed to despise them and a polity having grown up which made wealth the real source of political influence its acquisition was invested with a factitious value independent of its intrinsic utility <\s>

<s> its extent is limited and the extent of the more productive kinds of it more limited still <\s>
<s> it is also evident that the quantity of produce capable of being raised on any given piece of land is not indefinite <\s>
<s> this limited quantity of land and limited productiveness of it are the real limits to the increase of production <\s>
<s> the limitation to production from the properties of the soil is not like the obstacle opposed by a wall which stands immovable in one particular spot and offers no hindrance to motion short of stopping it entirely <\s>
<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>
<s> it seems however that this process of reduction culminated about 1879 <\s>

<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>

<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

<s> the united states also escapes from the heavy taxation which in europe is imposed to maintain an extravagant army and navy chest <\s>
<s> the effect of institutions moreover in stimulating the growth of material prosperity is far more true of the united states than of england for the barriers raised against the movement from lower to higher social classes in the latter country are non existent here and consequently there is more stimulus toward acquiring the means of bettering a mans social condition <\s>
<s> the geographical causes which have made industry rather than war the natural source of power and importance to great britain and the united states have turned an unusual proportion of the most enterprising and energetic characters into the direction of manufactures and commerce into supplying their wants and gratifying their ambition by producing and saving rather than by appropriating what has been produced and saved <\s>
<s> much also depended on the better political institutions of this country which by the scope they have allowed to individual freedom of action have encouraged personal activity and self reliance while by the liberty they confer of association and combination they facilitate industrial enterprise on a large scale <\s>
<s> the same institutions in another of their aspects give a most direct and potent stimulus to the desire of acquiring wealth <\s>
<s> the earlier decline of feudalism in england having removed or much weakened invidious distinctions between the originally trading classes and those who had been accustomed to despise them and a polity having grown up which made wealth the real source of political influence its acquisition was invested with a factitious value independent of its intrinsic utility <\s>
<s> and inasmuch as to be rich without industry has always hitherto constituted a step in the social scale above those who are rich by means of industry it becomes the object of ambition to save not merely as much as will afford a large income while in business but enough to retire from business and live in affluence on realized gains <\s>
<s> in the united states england and holland then for a long time past and now in most other countries in europe the second requisite of increased production increase of capital shows no tendency to become deficient <\s>
<s> so far as that element is concerned production is susceptible of an increase without any assignable bounds <\s>
<s> the limitation to production not consisting in any necessary limit to the increase of the other two elements labor and capital must turn upon the properties of the only element which is inherently and in itself limited in quantity <\s>
<s> it must depend on the properties of land <\s>
<s> of the law of the increase of production from land <\s>
<s> the law of production from the soil a law of diminishing return in proportion to the increased application of labor and capital <\s>
<s> land differs from the other elements of production labor and capital in not being susceptible of indefinite increase <\s>
<s> its extent is limited and the extent of the more productive kinds of it more limited still <\s>
<s> it is also evident that the quantity of produce capable of being raised on any given piece of land is not indefinite <\s>
<s> this limited quantity of land and limited productiveness of it are the real limits to the increase of production <\s>
<s> the limitation to production from the properties of the soil is not like the obstacle opposed by a wall which stands immovable in one particular spot and offers no hindrance to motion short of stopping it entirely <\s>
<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>

<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

<s> the geographical causes which have made industry rather than war the natural source of power and importance to great britain and the united states have turned an unusual proportion of the most enterprising and energetic characters into the direction of manufactures and commerce into supplying their wants and gratifying their ambition by producing and saving rather than by appropriating what has been produced and saved <\s>
<s> much also depended on the better political institutions of this country which by the scope they have allowed to individual freedom of action have encouraged personal activity and self reliance while by the liberty they confer of association and combination they facilitate industrial enterprise on a large scale <\s>
<s> the same institutions in another of their aspects give a most direct and potent stimulus to the desire of acquiring wealth <\s>

<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>
<s> it seems however that this process of reduction culminated about 1879 <\s>
<s> in order to show the facts of this process note the changes in the following chart no <\s>
<s> the railways of the state of new york are taken but the same is also true of those of ohio chart v <\s>

<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>

<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

<s> the geographical causes which have made industry rather than war the natural source of power and importance to great britain and the united states have turned an unusual proportion of the most enterprising and energetic characters into the direction of manufactures and commerce into supplying their wants and gratifying their ambition by producing and saving rather than by appropriating what has been produced and saved <\s>
<s> much also depended on the better political institutions of this country which by the scope they have allowed to individual freedom of action have encouraged personal activity and self reliance while by the liberty they confer of association and combination they facilitate industrial enterprise on a large scale <\s>
<s> the same institutions in another of their aspects give a most direct and potent stimulus to the desire of acquiring wealth <\s>
<s> the earlier decline of feudalism in england having removed or much weakened invidious distinctions between the originally trading classes and those who had been accustomed to despise them and a polity having grown up which made wealth the real source of political influence its acquisition was invested with a factitious value independent of its intrinsic utility <\s>
<s> and inasmuch as to be rich without industry has always hitherto constituted a step in the social scale above those who are rich by means of industry it becomes the object of ambition to save not merely as much as will afford a large income while in business but enough to retire from business and live in affluence on realized gains <\s>
<s> in the united states england and holland then for a long time past and now in most other countries in europe the second requisite of increased production increase of capital shows no tendency to become deficient <\s>
<s> so far as that element is concerned production is susceptible of an increase without any assignable bounds <\s>
<s> the limitation to production not consisting in any necessary limit to the increase of the other two elements labor and capital must turn upon the properties of the only element which is inherently and in itself limited in quantity <\s>
<s> it must depend on the properties of land <\s>
<s> of the law of the increase of production from land <\s>
<s> the law of production from the soil a law of diminishing return in proportion to the increased application of labor and capital <\s>
<s> land differs from the other elements of production labor and capital in not being susceptible of indefinite increase <\s>
<s> its extent is limited and the extent of the more productive kinds of it more limited still <\s>
<s> it is also evident that the quantity of produce capable of being raised on any given piece of land is not indefinite <\s>
<s> this limited quantity of land and limited productiveness of it are the real limits to the increase of production <\s>
<s> the limitation to production from the properties of the soil is not like the obstacle opposed by a wall which stands immovable in one particular spot and offers no hindrance to motion short of stopping it entirely <\s>
<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>

<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

<s> but in the united states the same growth is seen as among the english <\s>

<s> the united states also escapes from the heavy taxation which in europe is imposed to maintain an extravagant army and navy chest <\s>
<s> the effect of institutions moreover in stimulating the growth of material prosperity is far more true of the united states than of england for the barriers raised against the movement from lower to higher social classes in the latter country are non existent here and consequently there is more stimulus toward acquiring the means of bettering a mans social condition <\s>
<s> the geographical causes which have made industry rather than war the natural source of power and importance to great britain and the united states have turned an unusual proportion of the most enterprising and energetic characters into the direction of manufactures and commerce into supplying their wants and gratifying their ambition by producing and saving rather than by appropriating what has been produced and saved <\s>
<s> much also depended on the better political institutions of this country which by the scope they have allowed to individual freedom of action have encouraged personal activity and self reliance while by the liberty they confer of association and combination they facilitate industrial enterprise on a large scale <\s>
<s> the same institutions in another of their aspects give a most direct and potent stimulus to the desire of acquiring wealth <\s>
<s> the earlier decline of feudalism in england having removed or much weakened invidious distinctions between the originally trading classes and those who had been accustomed to despise them and a polity having grown up which made wealth the real source of political influence its acquisition was invested with a factitious value independent of its intrinsic utility <\s>
<s> and inasmuch as to be rich without industry has always hitherto constituted a step in the social scale above those who are rich by means of industry it becomes the object of ambition to save not merely as much as will afford a large income while in business but enough to retire from business and live in affluence on realized gains <\s>
<s> in the united states england and holland then for a long time past and now in most other countries in europe the second requisite of increased production increase of capital shows no tendency to become deficient <\s>
<s> so far as that element is concerned production is susceptible of an increase without any assignable bounds <\s>
<s> the limitation to production not consisting in any necessary limit to the increase of the other two elements labor and capital must turn upon the properties of the only element which is inherently and in itself limited in quantity <\s>
<s> it must depend on the properties of land <\s>
<s> of the law of the increase of production from land <\s>
<s> the law of production from the soil a law of diminishing return in proportion to the increased application of labor and capital <\s>
<s> land differs from the other elements of production labor and capital in not being susceptible of indefinite increase <\s>
<s> its extent is limited and the extent of the more productive kinds of it more limited still <\s>
<s> it is also evident that the quantity of produce capable of being raised on any given piece of land is not indefinite <\s>
<s> this limited quantity of land and limited productiveness of it are the real limits to the increase of production <\s>
<s> the limitation to production from the properties of the soil is not like the obstacle opposed by a wall which stands immovable in one particular spot and offers no hindrance to motion short of stopping it entirely <\s>
<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>

<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>

<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>

<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>

<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

<s> the geographical causes which have made industry rather than war the natural source of power and importance to great britain and the united states have turned an unusual proportion of the most enterprising and energetic characters into the direction of manufactures and commerce into supplying their wants and gratifying their ambition by producing and saving rather than by appropriating what has been produced and saved <\s>
<s> much also depended on the better political institutions of this country which by the scope they have allowed to individual freedom of action have encouraged personal activity and self reliance while by the liberty they confer of association and combination they facilitate industrial enterprise on a large scale <\s>
<s> the same institutions in another of their aspects give a most direct and potent stimulus to the desire of acquiring wealth <\s>
<s> the earlier decline of feudalism in england having removed or much weakened invidious distinctions between the originally trading classes and those who had been accustomed to despise them and a polity having grown up which made wealth the real source of political influence its acquisition was invested with a factitious value independent of its intrinsic utility <\s>
<s> and inasmuch as to be rich without industry has always hitherto constituted a step in the social scale above those who are rich by means of industry it becomes the object of ambition to save not merely as much as will afford a large income while in business but enough to retire from business and live in affluence on realized gains <\s>
<s> in the united states england and holland then for a long time past and now in most other countries in europe the second requisite of increased production increase of capital shows no tendency to become deficient <\s>
<s> so far as that element is concerned production is susceptible of an increase without any assignable bounds <\s>

<s> of the law of the increase of production from land <\s>
<s> the law of production from the soil a law of diminishing return in proportion to the increased application of labor and capital <\s>
<s> land differs from the other elements of production labor and capital in not being susceptible of indefinite increase <\s>
<s> its extent is limited and the extent of the more productive kinds of it more limited still <\s>
<s> it is also evident that the quantity of produce capable of being raised on any given piece of land is not indefinite <\s>
<s> this limited quantity of land and limited productiveness of it are the real limits to the increase of production <\s>
<s> the limitation to production from the properties of the soil is not like the obstacle opposed by a wall which stands immovable in one particular spot and offers no hindrance to motion short of stopping it entirely <\s>
<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>

<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

<s> but in the united states the same growth is seen as among the english <\s>
<s> the net deposits of the national banks of the united states in 1871 were 636,000 000 but in 1883 they had increased more than 83 per cent to 1,168 000,000 <\s>

<s> the united states also escapes from the heavy taxation which in europe is imposed to maintain an extravagant army and navy chest <\s>
<s> the effect of institutions moreover in stimulating the growth of material prosperity is far more true of the united states than of england for the barriers raised against the movement from lower to higher social classes in the latter country are non existent here and consequently there is more stimulus toward acquiring the means of bettering a mans social condition <\s>
<s> the geographical causes which have made industry rather than war the natural source of power and importance to great britain and the united states have turned an unusual proportion of the most enterprising and energetic characters into the direction of manufactures and commerce into supplying their wants and gratifying their ambition by producing and saving rather than by appropriating what has been produced and saved <\s>
<s> much also depended on the better political institutions of this country which by the scope they have allowed to individual freedom of action have encouraged personal activity and self reliance while by the liberty they confer of association and combination they facilitate industrial enterprise on a large scale <\s>
<s> the same institutions in another of their aspects give a most direct and potent stimulus to the desire of acquiring wealth <\s>
<s> the earlier decline of feudalism in england having removed or much weakened invidious distinctions between the originally trading classes and those who had been accustomed to despise them and a polity having grown up which made wealth the real source of political influence its acquisition was invested with a factitious value independent of its intrinsic utility <\s>
<s> and inasmuch as to be rich without industry has always hitherto constituted a step in the social scale above those who are rich by means of industry it becomes the object of ambition to save not merely as much as will afford a large income while in business but enough to retire from business and live in affluence on realized gains <\s>
<s> in the united states england and holland then for a long time past and now in most other countries in europe the second requisite of increased production increase of capital shows no tendency to become deficient <\s>
<s> so far as that element is concerned production is susceptible of an increase without any assignable bounds <\s>
<s> the limitation to production not consisting in any necessary limit to the increase of the other two elements labor and capital must turn upon the properties of the only element which is inherently and in itself limited in quantity <\s>
<s> it must depend on the properties of land <\s>
<s> of the law of the increase of production from land <\s>
<s> the law of production from the soil a law of diminishing return in proportion to the increased application of labor and capital <\s>
<s> land differs from the other elements of production labor and capital in not being susceptible of indefinite increase <\s>
<s> its extent is limited and the extent of the more productive kinds of it more limited still <\s>
<s> it is also evident that the quantity of produce capable of being raised on any given piece of land is not indefinite <\s>
<s> this limited quantity of land and limited productiveness of it are the real limits to the increase of production <\s>
<s> the limitation to production from the properties of the soil is not like the obstacle opposed by a wall which stands immovable in one particular spot and offers no hindrance to motion short of stopping it entirely <\s>
<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>

<s> the geographical causes which have made industry rather than war the natural source of power and importance to great britain and the united states have turned an unusual proportion of the most enterprising and energetic characters into the direction of manufactures and commerce into supplying their wants and gratifying their ambition by producing and saving rather than by appropriating what has been produced and saved <\s>
<s> much also depended on the better political institutions of this country which by the scope they have allowed to individual freedom of action have encouraged personal activity and self reliance while by the liberty they confer of association and combination they facilitate industrial enterprise on a large scale <\s>

<s> the earlier decline of feudalism in england having removed or much weakened invidious distinctions between the originally trading classes and those who had been accustomed to despise them and a polity having grown up which made wealth the real source of political influence its acquisition was invested with a factitious value independent of its intrinsic utility <\s>

<s> its extent is limited and the extent of the more productive kinds of it more limited still <\s>
<s> it is also evident that the quantity of produce capable of being raised on any given piece of land is not indefinite <\s>
<s> this limited quantity of land and limited productiveness of it are the real limits to the increase of production <\s>
<s> the limitation to production from the properties of the soil is not like the obstacle opposed by a wall which stands immovable in one particular spot and offers no hindrance to motion short of stopping it entirely <\s>
<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>
<s> it seems however that this process of reduction culminated about 1879 <\s>

<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>

<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

<s> the united states also escapes from the heavy taxation which in europe is imposed to maintain an extravagant army and navy chest <\s>
<s> the effect of institutions moreover in stimulating the growth of material prosperity is far more true of the united states than of england for the barriers raised against the movement from lower to higher social classes in the latter country are non existent here and consequently there is more stimulus toward acquiring the means of bettering a mans social condition <\s>
<s> the geographical causes which have made industry rather than war the natural source of power and importance to great britain and the united states have turned an unusual proportion of the most enterprising and energetic characters into the direction of manufactures and commerce into supplying their wants and gratifying their ambition by producing and saving rather than by appropriating what has been produced and saved <\s>
<s> much also depended on the better political institutions of this country which by the scope they have allowed to individual freedom of action have encouraged personal activity and self reliance while by the liberty they confer of association and combination they facilitate industrial enterprise on a large scale <\s>
<s> the same institutions in another of their aspects give a most direct and potent stimulus to the desire of acquiring wealth <\s>
<s> the earlier decline of feudalism in england having removed or much weakened invidious distinctions between the originally trading classes and those who had been accustomed to despise them and a polity having grown up which made wealth the real source of political influence its acquisition was invested with a factitious value independent of its intrinsic utility <\s>
<s> and inasmuch as to be rich without industry has always hitherto constituted a step in the social scale above those who are rich by means of industry it becomes the object of ambition to save not merely as much as will afford a large income while in business but enough to retire from business and live in affluence on realized gains <\s>
<s> in the united states england and holland then for a long time past and now in most other countries in europe the second requisite of increased production increase of capital shows no tendency to become deficient <\s>
<s> so far as that element is concerned production is susceptible of an increase without any assignable bounds <\s>
<s> the limitation to production not consisting in any necessary limit to the increase of the other two elements labor and capital must turn upon the properties of the only element which is inherently and in itself limited in quantity <\s>
<s> it must depend on the properties of land <\s>
<s> of the law of the increase of production from land <\s>
<s> the law of production from the soil a law of diminishing return in proportion to the increased application of labor and capital <\s>
<s> land differs from the other elements of production labor and capital in not being susceptible of indefinite increase <\s>
<s> its extent is limited and the extent of the more productive kinds of it more limited still <\s>
<s> it is also evident that the quantity of produce capable of being raised on any given piece of land is not indefinite <\s>
<s> this limited quantity of land and limited productiveness of it are the real limits to the increase of production <\s>
<s> the limitation to production from the properties of the soil is not like the obstacle opposed by a wall which stands immovable in one particular spot and offers no hindrance to motion short of stopping it entirely <\s>
<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>

<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

<s> the geographical causes which have made industry rather than war the natural source of power and importance to great britain and the united states have turned an unusual proportion of the most enterprising and energetic characters into the direction of manufactures and commerce into supplying their wants and gratifying their ambition by producing and saving rather than by appropriating what has been produced and saved <\s>
<s> much also depended on the better political institutions of this country which by the scope they have allowed to individual freedom of action have encouraged personal activity and self reliance while by the liberty they confer of association and combination they facilitate industrial enterprise on a large scale <\s>
<s> the same institutions in another of their aspects give a most direct and potent stimulus to the desire of acquiring wealth <\s>

<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>
<s> it seems however that this process of reduction culminated about 1879 <\s>
<s> in order to show the facts of this process note the changes in the following chart no <\s>
<s> the railways of the state of new york are taken but the same is also true of those of ohio chart v <\s>

<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>

<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

<s> the geographical causes which have made industry rather than war the natural source of power and importance to great britain and the united states have turned an unusual proportion of the most enterprising and energetic characters into the direction of manufactures and commerce into supplying their wants and gratifying their ambition by producing and saving rather than by appropriating what has been produced and saved <\s>
<s> much also depended on the better political institutions of this country which by the scope they have allowed to individual freedom of action have encouraged personal activity and self reliance while by the liberty they confer of association and combination they facilitate industrial enterprise on a large scale <\s>
<s> the same institutions in another of their aspects give a most direct and potent stimulus to the desire of acquiring wealth <\s>
<s> the earlier decline of feudalism in england having removed or much weakened invidious distinctions between the originally trading classes and those who had been accustomed to despise them and a polity having grown up which made wealth the real source of political influence its acquisition was invested with a factitious value independent of its intrinsic utility <\s>
<s> and inasmuch as to be rich without industry has always hitherto constituted a step in the social scale above those who are rich by means of industry it becomes the object of ambition to save not merely as much as will afford a large income while in business but enough to retire from business and live in affluence on realized gains <\s>
<s> in the united states england and holland then for a long time past and now in most other countries in europe the second requisite of increased production increase of capital shows no tendency to become deficient <\s>
<s> so far as that element is concerned production is susceptible of an increase without any assignable bounds <\s>
<s> the limitation to production not consisting in any necessary limit to the increase of the other two elements labor and capital must turn upon the properties of the only element which is inherently and in itself limited in quantity <\s>
<s> it must depend on the properties of land <\s>
<s> of the law of the increase of production from land <\s>
<s> the law of production from the soil a law of diminishing return in proportion to the increased application of labor and capital <\s>
<s> land differs from the other elements of production labor and capital in not being susceptible of indefinite increase <\s>
<s> its extent is limited and the extent of the more productive kinds of it more limited still <\s>
<s> it is also evident that the quantity of produce capable of being raised on any given piece of land is not indefinite <\s>
<s> this limited quantity of land and limited productiveness of it are the real limits to the increase of production <\s>
<s> the limitation to production from the properties of the soil is not like the obstacle opposed by a wall which stands immovable in one particular spot and offers no hindrance to motion short of stopping it entirely <\s>
<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>

<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

<s> but in the united states the same growth is seen as among the english <\s>

<s> the united states also escapes from the heavy taxation which in europe is imposed to maintain an extravagant army and navy chest <\s>
<s> the effect of institutions moreover in stimulating the growth of material prosperity is far more true of the united states than of england for the barriers raised against the movement from lower to higher social classes in the latter country are non existent here and consequently there is more stimulus toward acquiring the means of bettering a mans social condition <\s>
<s> the geographical causes which have made industry rather than war the natural source of power and importance to great britain and the united states have turned an unusual proportion of the most enterprising and energetic characters into the direction of manufactures and commerce into supplying their wants and gratifying their ambition by producing and saving rather than by appropriating what has been produced and saved <\s>
<s> much also depended on the better political institutions of this country which by the scope they have allowed to individual freedom of action have encouraged personal activity and self reliance while by the liberty they confer of association and combination they facilitate industrial enterprise on a large scale <\s>
<s> the same institutions in another of their aspects give a most direct and potent stimulus to the desire of acquiring wealth <\s>
<s> the earlier decline of feudalism in england having removed or much weakened invidious distinctions between the originally trading classes and those who had been accustomed to despise them and a polity having grown up which made wealth the real source of political influence its acquisition was invested with a factitious value independent of its intrinsic utility <\s>
<s> and inasmuch as to be rich without industry has always hitherto constituted a step in the social scale above those who are rich by means of industry it becomes the object of ambition to save not merely as much as will afford a large income while in business but enough to retire from business and live in affluence on realized gains <\s>
<s> in the united states england and holland then for a long time past and now in most other countries in europe the second requisite of increased production increase of capital shows no tendency to become deficient <\s>
<s> so far as that element is concerned production is susceptible of an increase without any assignable bounds <\s>
<s> the limitation to production not consisting in any necessary limit to the increase of the other two elements labor and capital must turn upon the properties of the only element which is inherently and in itself limited in quantity <\s>
<s> it must depend on the properties of land <\s>
<s> of the law of the increase of production from land <\s>
<s> the law of production from the soil a law of diminishing return in proportion to the increased application of labor and capital <\s>
<s> land differs from the other elements of production labor and capital in not being susceptible of indefinite increase <\s>
<s> its extent is limited and the extent of the more productive kinds of it more limited still <\s>
<s> it is also evident that the quantity of produce capable of being raised on any given piece of land is not indefinite <\s>
<s> this limited quantity of land and limited productiveness of it are the real limits to the increase of production <\s>
<s> the limitation to production from the properties of the soil is not like the obstacle opposed by a wall which stands immovable in one particular spot and offers no hindrance to motion short of stopping it entirely <\s>
<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>

<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>

<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>

<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>

<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

<s> the geographical causes which have made industry rather than war the natural source of power and importance to great britain and the united states have turned an unusual proportion of the most enterprising and energetic characters into the direction of manufactures and commerce into supplying their wants and gratifying their ambition by producing and saving rather than by appropriating what has been produced and saved <\s>
<s> much also depended on the better political institutions of this country which by the scope they have allowed to individual freedom of action have encouraged personal activity and self reliance while by the liberty they confer of association and combination they facilitate industrial enterprise on a large scale <\s>
<s> the same institutions in another of their aspects give a most direct and potent stimulus to the desire of acquiring wealth <\s>
<s> the earlier decline of feudalism in england having removed or much weakened invidious distinctions between the originally trading classes and those who had been accustomed to despise them and a polity having grown up which made wealth the real source of political influence its acquisition was invested with a factitious value independent of its intrinsic utility <\s>
<s> and inasmuch as to be rich without industry has always hitherto constituted a step in the social scale above those who are rich by means of industry it becomes the object of ambition to save not merely as much as will afford a large income while in business but enough to retire from business and live in affluence on realized gains <\s>
<s> in the united states england and holland then for a long time past and now in most other countries in europe the second requisite of increased production increase of capital shows no tendency to become deficient <\s>
<s> so far as that element is concerned production is susceptible of an increase without any assignable bounds <\s>

<s> of the law of the increase of production from land <\s>
<s> the law of production from the soil a law of diminishing return in proportion to the increased application of labor and capital <\s>
<s> land differs from the other elements of production labor and capital in not being susceptible of indefinite increase <\s>
<s> its extent is limited and the extent of the more productive kinds of it more limited still <\s>
<s> it is also evident that the quantity of produce capable of being raised on any given piece of land is not indefinite <\s>
<s> this limited quantity of land and limited productiveness of it are the real limits to the increase of production <\s>
<s> the limitation to production from the properties of the soil is not like the obstacle opposed by a wall which stands immovable in one particular spot and offers no hindrance to motion short of stopping it entirely <\s>
<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>

<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

<s> but in the united states the same growth is seen as among the english <\s>
<s> the net deposits of the national banks of the united states in 1871 were 636,000 000 but in 1883 they had increased more than 83 per cent to 1,168 000,000 <\s>

<s> the united states also escapes from the heavy taxation which in europe is imposed to maintain an extravagant army and navy chest <\s>
<s> the effect of institutions moreover in stimulating the growth of material prosperity is far more true of the united states than of england for the barriers raised against the movement from lower to higher social classes in the latter country are non existent here and consequently there is more stimulus toward acquiring the means of bettering a mans social condition <\s>
<s> the geographical causes which have made industry rather than war the natural source of power and importance to great britain and the united states have turned an unusual proportion of the most enterprising and energetic characters into the direction of manufactures and commerce into supplying their wants and gratifying their ambition by producing and saving rather than by appropriating what has been produced and saved <\s>
<s> much also depended on the better political institutions of this country which by the scope they have allowed to individual freedom of action have encouraged personal activity and self reliance while by the liberty they confer of association and combination they facilitate industrial enterprise on a large scale <\s>
<s> the same institutions in another of their aspects give a most direct and potent stimulus to the desire of acquiring wealth <\s>
<s> the earlier decline of feudalism in england having removed or much weakened invidious distinctions between the originally trading classes and those who had been accustomed to despise them and a polity having grown up which made wealth the real source of political influence its acquisition was invested with a factitious value independent of its intrinsic utility <\s>
<s> and inasmuch as to be rich without industry has always hitherto constituted a step in the social scale above those who are rich by means of industry it becomes the object of ambition to save not merely as much as will afford a large income while in business but enough to retire from business and live in affluence on realized gains <\s>
<s> in the united states england and holland then for a long time past and now in most other countries in europe the second requisite of increased production increase of capital shows no tendency to become deficient <\s>
<s> so far as that element is concerned production is susceptible of an increase without any assignable bounds <\s>
<s> the limitation to production not consisting in any necessary limit to the increase of the other two elements labor and capital must turn upon the properties of the only element which is inherently and in itself limited in quantity <\s>
<s> it must depend on the properties of land <\s>
<s> of the law of the increase of production from land <\s>
<s> the law of production from the soil a law of diminishing return in proportion to the increased application of labor and capital <\s>
<s> land differs from the other elements of production labor and capital in not being susceptible of indefinite increase <\s>
<s> its extent is limited and the extent of the more productive kinds of it more limited still <\s>
<s> it is also evident that the quantity of produce capable of being raised on any given piece of land is not indefinite <\s>
<s> this limited quantity of land and limited productiveness of it are the real limits to the increase of production <\s>
<s> the limitation to production from the properties of the soil is not like the obstacle opposed by a wall which stands immovable in one particular spot and offers no hindrance to motion short of stopping it entirely <\s>
<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>

<s> the geographical causes which have made industry rather than war the natural source of power and importance to great britain and the united states have turned an unusual proportion of the most enterprising and energetic characters into the direction of manufactures and commerce into supplying their wants and gratifying their ambition by producing and saving rather than by appropriating what has been produced and saved <\s>
<s> much also depended on the better political institutions of this country which by the scope they have allowed to individual freedom of action have encouraged personal activity and self reliance while by the liberty they confer of association and combination they facilitate industrial enterprise on a large scale <\s>

<s> the earlier decline of feudalism in england having removed or much weakened invidious distinctions between the originally trading classes and those who had been accustomed to despise them and a polity having grown up which made wealth the real source of political influence its acquisition was invested with a factitious value independent of its intrinsic utility <\s>

<s> its extent is limited and the extent of the more productive kinds of it more limited still <\s>
<s> it is also evident that the quantity of produce capable of being raised on any given piece of land is not indefinite <\s>
<s> this limited quantity of land and limited productiveness of it are the real limits to the increase of production <\s>
<s> the limitation to production from the properties of the soil is not like the obstacle opposed by a wall which stands immovable in one particular spot and offers no hindrance to motion short of stopping it entirely <\s>
<s> we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached <\s>
<s> after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agricultureas soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable toolsfrom that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land <\s>
<s> this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy <\s>
<s> were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are <\s>
<s> it is not generally considered that in the united states where in many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly being brought into cultivation an additional population under existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law of diminishing returns begins to operate <\s>
<s> where more laborers are necessary and more capital wanted to co operate in a new country before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing returns has yet practically set in <\s>
<s> when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor <\s>
<s> the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce <\s>
<s> land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation <\s>
<s> the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market <\s>
<s> if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it <\s>
<s> instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more <\s>
<s> it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil <\s>
<s> the example of market gardens in the vicinity of great cities and towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor and capital with larger returns <\s>
<s> these lands by their situation are superior lands for this particular purpose although they might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when compared with the rich wheat lands of dakota <\s>
<s> new england and new jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their owners than the same land did under the old r  gime <\s>
<s> even on lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat <\s>
<s> inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price <\s>
<s> if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market <\s>
<s> lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit <\s>
<s> that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands <\s>
<s>    it is long    says a late traveler in the united states 130    before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent <\s>
<s> one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor    of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else <\s>
<s> but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation <\s>
<s> the western movement of what might be called the    wheat center    is quite perceptible <\s>
<s> until recently minnesota has been a great wheat producing state and vast tracts of land were there planted with that grain when the soil was first broken <\s>
<s> the profits on the first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more desirable for wheat growers to move onward to newer lands and to sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and varied products who produce for a denser population <\s>
<s> so that in 1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the greatest wheat production 131 only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself <\s>
<s> the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations <\s>
<s> even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed <\s>
<s> it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated <\s>
<s> this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment <\s>
<s> antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production <\s>
<s> that the produce of land increases c  teris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> this principle however has been denied <\s>
<s> so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england <\s>
<s> the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful attention <\s>
<s> carey asserts instead that there is a law of increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the soil 132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils into cultivation <\s>
<s> if this were true why would not one half an acre of land be as good as a whole state <\s>
<s> johnston 133 says    in a country and among poor settlers ... <\s>
<s> poor land is a relative term <\s>
<s> land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first crops <\s>
<s> thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich land to a rich man    134 moreover as is constantly the case in our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands into competition with old lands in a given market of which the most conspicuous example is the competition of western grain fields with the eastern farms <\s>
<s> in these older districts before the competition came there was a given series of grades in the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list <\s>
<s> the result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the wants of men <\s>
<s> this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law <\s>
<s> such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed <\s>
<s> it is no other than the progress of civilization <\s>
<s> the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention <\s>
<s> improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained <\s>
<s> 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation <\s>
<s> the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turnip husbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution <\s>
<s> next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip <\s>
<s> in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoil plowing or tile draining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like <\s>
<s> 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines <\s>
<s> these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand <\s>
<s>    in railways <\s>
<s> analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication <\s>
<s> good roads are equivalent to good tools <\s>
<s> it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed <\s>
<s> the functions performed by railways in the system of production is highly important <\s>
<s> they are among the most influential causes affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the chief <\s>
<s> the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of this service to the producers and consumers of the united states is a question of very great magnitude <\s>
<s> the serious reduction in the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent of legislation <\s>
<s> corn meat and dairy products form it is said at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states <\s>
<s> if a lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost less to move the main articles of immediate necessity <\s>
<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>
<s> it seems however that this process of reduction culminated about 1879 <\s>

<s> had the charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869 the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united states from 500,000 000 to 800,000 000 more than the charge actually made owing to the reductions by the railways <\s>

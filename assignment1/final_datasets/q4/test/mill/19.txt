<s> but the world hopes that some other relation than that of master and workman may be evolved in which not only many admitted wrongs may be avoided but also new forces may be applied to raise the laborer out of his dependence on other classes in the community <\s>

<s> cairnes in    a temporary improvement of the laborers condition followed by an increase of population and an enlarged demand for the cheapened commodity .... <\s>
<s> laborers    commodities however are for the most part commodities of raw produce or in which the raw material constitutes the chief element of the value clothing is in truth the only important exception ); and of all such commodities it is the well known law that an augmentation of quantity can only be obtained other things being the same at an increasing proportional cost <\s>
<s> thus it has happened that the gain in productiveness obtained by improved processes has after a generation to a great extent been lostlost that is to say for any benefit that can be derived from it in favor of wages and profits .... <\s>
<s> the large addition to the wealth of the country has gone neither to profits nor to wages nor yet to the public at large as consumers but to swell a fund ever growing even while its proprietors sleepthe rent roll of the owners of the soil .... <\s>
<s> the aggregate return from the land has immensely increased but the cost of the costliest portion of the produce which is that which determines the price of the whole remains pretty nearly as it was <\s>
<s> profits therefore have not risen at all and the real remuneration of the laborer taking the whole field of labor in but a slight degreeat all events in a degree very far from commensurate with the general progress of industry    306 under these conditions it seems that the only hope of an improvement for the laboring classes lies in the limitation of populationor at least in an increase of numbers less than the increase of capital and improvements <\s>
<s> it is possible however that mr <\s>
<s> cairnes with many others has failed to recognize the full extent of the improvement which is taking place in the wages of the laborer under the existing social order <\s>
<s> although we hear much of the wrongs of the working menand they no doubt existyet it is unquestionable that their condition has vastly improved within the last fifty years largely in my opinion because improvements have outstripped population and because wide areas of fertile land in new and peaceful countries have drawn off the surplus population in the older countries and because the available spots in the newer countries like the united states have not yet been covered over with a population sufficiently dense to keep real wages anything below a relatively high standard <\s>

<s> in other words the landlords have been great gainers while the laborers have intercepted much more than mr <\s>
<s> there are at hand some very striking data relating to the united states which point in the same direction as those of mr <\s>
<s> xix and xx show vividly how far the increased productiveness of an industry arising from greater skill and greater efficiency of labor in the connection of improved machinery has enabled manufacturers to steadily lower the price of their goods and yet increase the wages paid to their operatives <\s>

<s> while each spindle and loom has become vastly more effective we see by chart no <\s>
<s> but in a country of great annual savings and low profits no such effects need be apprehended <\s>
<s> it merely draws off at one orifice what was already flowing out at another or if not the greater vacant space left in the reservoir does but cause a greater quantity to flow in <\s>
<s> accordingly in spite of the mischievous derangements of the money market which have been occasioned by the great sums in process of being sunk in railways i can not agree with those who apprehend any mischief from this source to the productive resources of the country <\s>
<s> not on the absurd ground which to any one acquainted with the elements of the subject needs no confutation that railway expenditure is a mere transfer of capital from hand to hand by which nothing is lost or destroyed <\s>
<s> this is true of what is spent in the purchase of the land a portion too of what is paid to agents counsels engineers and surveyors is saved by those who receive it and becomes capital again but what is laid out in the bona fide construction of the railway itself is lost and gone when once expended it is incapable of ever being paid in wages or applied to the maintenance of laborers again as a matter of account the result is that so much food and clothing and tools have been consumed and the country has got a railway instead <\s>
<s> it already appears from these considerations that the conversion of circulating capital into fixed whether by railways or manufactories or ships or machinery or canals or mines or works of drainage and irrigation is not likely in any rich country to diminish the gross produce or the amount of employment for labor <\s>
<s> there is hardly any increase of fixed capital which does not enable the country to contain eventually a larger circulating capital than it otherwise could possess and employ within its own limits for there is hardly any creation of fixed capital which when it proves successful does not cheapen the articles on which wages are habitually expended <\s>
<s> as regards the effects upon the material condition of the wages receiving class since it seems clear that capital increases faster than improvements and probably faster even than population it follows that in countries where the laboring classes are evidently growing in intelligence they gain in wages with the progress of society <\s>

<s> stationary state of wealth and population dreaded by some writers but not in itself undesirable <\s>
<s> toward what ultimate point is society tending by its industrial progress <\s>
<s> when the progress ceases in what condition are we to expect that it will leave mankind <\s>
<s> it must always have been seen more or less distinctly by political economists that the increase of wealth is not boundless that at the end of what they term the progressive state lies the stationary state that all progress in wealth is but a postponement of this and that each step in advance is an approach to it <\s>
<s> we have now been led to recognize that this ultimate goal is at all times near enough to be fully in view that we are always on the verge of it and that if we have not reached it long ago it is because the goal itself flies before us <\s>
<s> the richest and most prosperous countries would very soon attain the stationary state if no further improvements were made in the productive arts and if there were a suspension of the overflow of capital from those countries into the uncultivated or ill cultivated regions of the earth <\s>
<s> adam smith always assumes that the condition of the mass of the people though it may not be positively distressed must be pinched and stinted in a stationary condition of wealth and can only be satisfactory in a progressive state <\s>

<s> malthus was either expressly or tacitly affirmed by his most distinguished predecessors and can only be successfully combated on his principles <\s>
<s> even in a progressive state of capital in old countries a conscientious or prudential restraint on population is indispensable to prevent the increase of numbers from outstripping the increase of capital and the condition of the classes who are at the bottom of society from being deteriorated <\s>
<s> where there is not in the people or in some very large proportion of them a resolute resistance to this deteriorationa determination to preserve an established standard of comfortthe condition of the poorest class sinks even in a progressive state to the lowest point which they will consent to endure <\s>
<s> the same determination would be equally effectual to keep up their condition in the stationary state and would be quite as likely to exist <\s>
<s> i can not therefore regard the stationary state of capital and wealth with the unaffected aversion so generally manifested toward it by political economists of the old school <\s>
<s> i am inclined to believe that it would be on the whole a very considerable improvement on our present condition <\s>
<s> it is only in the backward countries of the world that increased production is still an important object in those most advanced what is economically needed is a better distribution of which one indispensable means is a stricter restraint on population <\s>
<s> on the other hand we may suppose this better distribution of property attained by the joint effect of the prudence and frugality of individuals and of a system of legislation favoring equality of fortunes so far as is consistent with the just claim of the individual to the fruits whether great or small of his or her own industry <\s>
<s> we may suppose for instance according to the suggestion thrown out in a former chapter 304 a limitation of the sum which any one person may acquire by gift or inheritance to the amount sufficient to constitute a moderate independence <\s>
<s> under this twofold influence society would exhibit these leading features a well paid and affluent body of laborers no enormous fortunes except what were earned and accumulated during a single lifetime but a much larger body of persons than at present not only exempt from the coarser toils but with sufficient leisure both physical and mental from mechanical details to cultivate freely the graces of life and afford examples of them to the classes less favorably circumstanced for their growth <\s>
<s> this condition of society so greatly preferable to the present is not only perfectly compatible with the stationary state but it would seem more naturally allied with that state than with any other <\s>
<s> there is room in the world no doubt and even in old countries for a great increase of population supposing the arts of life to go on improving and capital to increase <\s>
<s> but even if innocuous i confess i see very little reason for desiring it <\s>
<s> the density of population necessary to enable mankind to obtain in the greatest degree all the advantages both of co operation and of social intercourse has in all the most populous countries been attained <\s>
<s> if the earth must lose that great portion of its pleasantness which it owes to things that the unlimited increase of wealth and population would extirpate from it for the mere purpose of enabling it to support a larger but not a better or a happier population i sincerely hope for the sake of posterity that they will be content to be stationary long before necessity compels them to it <\s>
<s> it is scarcely necessary to remark that a stationary condition of capital and population implies no stationary state of human improvement <\s>
<s> even the industrial arts might be as earnestly and as successfully cultivated with this sole difference that instead of serving no purpose but the increase of wealth industrial improvements would produce their legitimate effect that of abridging labor <\s>
<s> hitherto it is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the days toil of any human being <\s>
<s> they have enabled a greater population to live the same life of drudgery and imprisonment and an increased number of manufacturers and others to make fortunes <\s>
<s> they have increased the comforts of the middle classes <\s>
<s> the statement that inventions have not    lightened the days toil of any human being    has been persistently misquoted by many persons and has been taken out of its connection <\s>
<s> mill distinctly holds that the laborers lot could have been improved had there been any limitation of population that it is the constant growth of population as society progresses which destroys the gains afforded to the laboring classes by improvements <\s>
<s> but it is quite certain that the material facts of mr <\s>
<s> mills statement are no longer true <\s>
<s> in the united states wages have risen with an additional gain in lower prices and mr <\s>
<s> giffen shows the same progress in england <\s>
<s> moreover travelers on the continent speak of a similar movement already noticeable there <\s>
<s> giffens statement in his comparison 305 with fifty years ago is as follows    while the money wages have increased as we have seen the hours of labor have diminished <\s>
<s> it is difficult to estimate what the extent of this diminution has been but collecting one or two scattered notices i should be inclined to say very nearly 20 per cent <\s>
<s> there has been at least this reduction in the textile engineering and house building trades <\s>
<s> the workman gets from 50 to 100 per cent more money for 20 per cent less work in round figures he has gained from 70 to 120 per cent in fifty years in money return <\s>
<s> it is just possible of course that the workman may do as much or nearly as much in the shorter period as he did in his longer hours <\s>

<s> on the possible futurity of the laboring classes <\s>
<s> the possibility of improvement while laborers remain merely receivers of wages <\s>
<s> there has probably never been a time when more attention has been called to the material and social conditions of the working classes than in the last few years <\s>
<s> the great increase of literature and the extension of the newspaper has brought to every reader even where public and private charities have not sent eye witnesses into direct contact with distress a more explicit knowledge of the working classes than ever before <\s>
<s> the revelation of existing poverty and misery is often wrongly taken to be a proof of the increasing degradation of the working men and the cause has been ascribed to the grasping cruelty of capitalists <\s>
<s> instances of injustice arising from the relations of employers and employed will occur so long as human nature remains imperfect <\s>
<s> but the world hopes that some other relation than that of master and workman may be evolved in which not only many admitted wrongs may be avoided but also new forces may be applied to raise the laborer out of his dependence on other classes in the community <\s>
<s> we are at present living under a r  gime of private property and competition <\s>
<s> but certainly the progress of the laborer is not that which can excite enthusiastic hopes for the future so long as he remains a mere receiver of wages <\s>
<s> the progress of industrial improvements has resulted says mr <\s>
<s> cairnes in    a temporary improvement of the laborers condition followed by an increase of population and an enlarged demand for the cheapened commodity .... <\s>
<s> laborers    commodities however are for the most part commodities of raw produce or in which the raw material constitutes the chief element of the value clothing is in truth the only important exception ); and of all such commodities it is the well known law that an augmentation of quantity can only be obtained other things being the same at an increasing proportional cost <\s>
<s> thus it has happened that the gain in productiveness obtained by improved processes has after a generation to a great extent been lostlost that is to say for any benefit that can be derived from it in favor of wages and profits .... <\s>
<s> the large addition to the wealth of the country has gone neither to profits nor to wages nor yet to the public at large as consumers but to swell a fund ever growing even while its proprietors sleepthe rent roll of the owners of the soil .... <\s>
<s> the aggregate return from the land has immensely increased but the cost of the costliest portion of the produce which is that which determines the price of the whole remains pretty nearly as it was <\s>
<s> profits therefore have not risen at all and the real remuneration of the laborer taking the whole field of labor in but a slight degreeat all events in a degree very far from commensurate with the general progress of industry    306 under these conditions it seems that the only hope of an improvement for the laboring classes lies in the limitation of populationor at least in an increase of numbers less than the increase of capital and improvements <\s>
<s> it is possible however that mr <\s>
<s> cairnes with many others has failed to recognize the full extent of the improvement which is taking place in the wages of the laborer under the existing social order <\s>
<s> although we hear much of the wrongs of the working menand they no doubt existyet it is unquestionable that their condition has vastly improved within the last fifty years largely in my opinion because improvements have outstripped population and because wide areas of fertile land in new and peaceful countries have drawn off the surplus population in the older countries and because the available spots in the newer countries like the united states have not yet been covered over with a population sufficiently dense to keep real wages anything below a relatively high standard <\s>
<s> the facts to substantiate this opinion so far as regards great britain are to be found in a recent investigation 307 by mr <\s>

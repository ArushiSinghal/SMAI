<s> such are the effects of a commercial revulsion and that such revulsions are almost periodical is a consequence of the very tendency of profits which we are considering <\s>

<s> before inquiring whether this expectation is reasonable one remark must be made which is much at variance with commonly received notions <\s>

<s> cheap iron has in a certain measure the same effect on profits and the cost of labor as cheap corn because cheap iron makes cheap tools for agriculture and cheap machinery for clothing <\s>

<s> i believe this to have been for many years one of the principal causes by which the decline of profits in england has been arrested <\s>
<s> it has a twofold operation in the first place it does what a fire or an inundation or a commercial crisis would have doneit carries off a part of the increase of capital from which the reduction of profits proceeds secondly the capital so carried off is not lost but is chiefly employed either in founding colonies which become large exporters of cheap agricultural produce or in extending and perhaps improving the agriculture of older communities <\s>
<s> in countries which are further advanced in industry and population and have therefore a lower rate of profit than others there is always long before the actual minimum is reached a practical minimum viz when profits have fallen so much below what they are elsewhere that were they to fall lower all further accumulations would go abroad <\s>

<s> the theory of the effect of accumulation on profits must greatly abate or rather altogether destroy in countries where profits are low the immense importance which used to be attached by political economists to the effects which an event or a measure of government might have in adding to or subtracting from the capital of the country <\s>
<s> we have now seen that the lowness of profits is a proof that the spirit of accumulation is so active and that the increase of capital has proceeded at so rapid a rate as to outstrip the two counter agencies improvements in production and increased supply of cheap necessaries from abroad <\s>
<s> a sudden abstraction of capital unless of inordinate amount would not have any real effect in impoverishing the country <\s>
<s> after a few months or years there would exist in the country just as much capital as if none had been taken away <\s>
<s> the abstraction by raising profits and interest would give a fresh stimulus to the accumulative principle which would speedily fill up the vacuum <\s>
<s> probably indeed the only effect that would ensue would be that for some time afterward less capital would be exported and less thrown away in hazardous speculation <\s>
<s> in the first place then this view of things greatly weakens in a wealthy and industrious country the force of the economical argument against the expenditure of public money for really valuable even though industriously unproductive purposes <\s>
<s> in poor countries the capital of the country requires the legislators sedulous care he is bound to be most cautious of encroaching upon it and should favor to the utmost its accumulation at home and its introduction from abroad <\s>
<s> but in rich populous and highly cultivated countries it is not capital which is the deficient element but fertile land and what the legislator should desire and promote is not a greater aggregate saving but a greater return to savings either by improved cultivation or by access to the produce of more fertile lands in other parts of the globe <\s>
<s> the same considerations enable us to throw aside as unworthy of regard one of the common arguments against emigration as a means of relief for the laboring class <\s>
<s> emigration it is said can do no good to the laborers if in order to defray the cost as much must be taken away from the capital of the country as from its population <\s>
<s> if one tenth of the laboring people of england were transferred to the colonies and along with them one tenth of the circulating capital of the country either wages or profits or both would be greatly benefited by the diminished pressure of capital and population upon the fertility of the land <\s>
<s> the landlords alone would sustain some loss of income and even they only if colonization went to the length of actually diminishing capital and population but not if it merely carried off the annual increase <\s>
<s> in opulent countries the extension of machinery not detrimental but beneficial to laborers <\s>
<s> from the same principles we are now able to arrive at a final conclusion respecting the effects which machinery and generally the sinking of capital for a productive purpose produce upon the immediate and ultimate interests of the laboring class <\s>
<s> the characteristic property of this class of industrial improvements is the conversion of circulating capital into fixed and it was shown in the first book 303 that in a country where capital accumulates slowly the introduction of machinery permanent improvements of land and the like might be for the time extremely injurious since the capital so employed might be directly taken from the wages fund the subsistence of the people and the employment for labor curtailed and the gross annual produce of the country actually diminished <\s>

<s> an augmentation of capital much more rapid than that of population must soon reach its extreme limit unless accompanied by increased efficiency of labor through inventions and discoveries or improved mental and physical education or unless some of the idle people or of the unproductive laborers became productive <\s>
<s> if population did increase with the increase of capital and in proportion to it the fall of profits would still be inevitable <\s>
<s> increased population implies increased demand for agricultural produce <\s>
<s> in the absence of industrial improvements this demand can only be supplied at an increased cost of production either by cultivating worse land or by a more elaborate and costly cultivation of the land already under tillage <\s>
<s> the cost of the laborers subsistence is therefore increased and unless the laborer submits to a deterioration of his condition profits must fall <\s>
<s> in an old country like england if in addition to supposing all improvement in domestic agriculture suspended we suppose that there is no increased production in foreign countries for the english market the fall of profits would be very rapid <\s>

<s> on the whole therefore we may assume that in such a country as england if the present annual amount of savings were to continue without any of the counteracting circumstances which now keep in check the natural influence of those savings in reducing profit the rate of profit would speedily attain the minimum and all further accumulation of capital would for the present cease <\s>
<s> carey on the other hand asserts the existence of a law of increasing returns from land and that while wages are constantly increasing with the progress of society there is a diminution in the rate of profit although the increasing returns permit an increase of absolute if not of proportional profit <\s>

<s> the resisting agencies are of several kinds <\s>
<s> first among them is the waste of capital in periods of overtrading and rash speculation and in the commercial revulsions by which such times are always followed <\s>

<s> establishments are shut up or kept working without any profit <\s>
<s> such are the effects of a commercial revulsion and that such revulsions are almost periodical is a consequence of the very tendency of profits which we are considering <\s>
<s> by the time a few years have passed over without a crisis so much additional capital has been accumulated that it is no longer possible to invest it at the accustomed profit all public securities rise to a high price the rate of interest on the best mercantile security falls very low and the complaint is general among persons in business that no money is to be made <\s>

<s> the cheapening of lace or velvet has no effect in diminishing the cost of labor and no mode can be pointed out in which it can raise the rate of profit so as to make room for a larger capital before the minimum is attained <\s>
<s> it however produces an effect which is virtually equivalent it lowers or tends to lower the minimum itself <\s>
<s> in the first place increased cheapness of articles of consumption promotes the inclination to save by affording to all consumers a surplus which they may lay by consistently with their accustomed manner of living <\s>

<s> if people can live on an independence of 1,000 a year in the same manner as they formerly could on one of 2,000 some persons will be induced to save in hopes of the one who would have been deterred by the more remote prospect of the other <\s>
<s> all improvements therefore in the production of almost any commodity tend in some degree to widen the interval which has to be passed before arriving at the stationary state <\s>
<s>    by the importation of cheap necessaries and implements <\s>
<s> equivalent in effect to improvements in production is the acquisition of any new power of obtaining cheap commodities from foreign countries <\s>
<s> if necessaries are cheapened whether they are so by improvements at home or importation from abroad is exactly the same thing to wages and profits <\s>

<s> before inquiring whether this expectation is reasonable one remark must be made which is much at variance with commonly received notions <\s>
<s> foreign trade does not necessarily increase the field of employment for capital <\s>

<s> it may do this in two ways by the importation either of those commodities themselves or of the means and appliances for producing them <\s>
<s> cheap iron has in a certain measure the same effect on profits and the cost of labor as cheap corn because cheap iron makes cheap tools for agriculture and cheap machinery for clothing <\s>
<s> but a foreign trade which neither directly nor by any indirect consequence increases the cheapness of anything consumed by the laborers does not any more than an invention or discovery in the like case tend to raise profits or retard their fall it merely substitutes the production of goods for foreign markets in the room of the home production of luxuries leaving the employment for capital neither greater nor less than before <\s>
<s> it must of course be supposed that with the increase of capital population also increases for if it did not the consequent rise of wages would bring down profits in spite of any cheapness of food <\s>
<s> suppose then that the population of great britain goes on increasing at its present rate and demands every year a supply of imported food considerably beyond that of the year preceding <\s>
<s> this annual increase in the food demanded from the exporting countries can only be obtained either by great improvements in their agriculture or by the application of a great additional capital to the growth of food <\s>

<s> increased population implies increased demand for agricultural produce <\s>
<s> in the absence of industrial improvements this demand can only be supplied at an increased cost of production either by cultivating worse land or by a more elaborate and costly cultivation of the land already under tillage <\s>
<s> the cost of the laborers subsistence is therefore increased and unless the laborer submits to a deterioration of his condition profits must fall <\s>
<s> in an old country like england if in addition to supposing all improvement in domestic agriculture suspended we suppose that there is no increased production in foreign countries for the english market the fall of profits would be very rapid <\s>

<s> on the whole therefore we may assume that in such a country as england if the present annual amount of savings were to continue without any of the counteracting circumstances which now keep in check the natural influence of those savings in reducing profit the rate of profit would speedily attain the minimum and all further accumulation of capital would for the present cease <\s>

<s> the resisting agencies are of several kinds <\s>
<s> first among them is the waste of capital in periods of overtrading and rash speculation and in the commercial revulsions by which such times are always followed <\s>
<s> mines are opened railways or bridges made and many other works of uncertain profit commenced and in these enterprises much capital is sunk which yields either no return or none adequate to the outlay <\s>

<s> even if they are kept in employment the capital is no less sunk it has been converted from circulating into fixed capital and has ceased to have any influence on wages or profits <\s>
<s> besides this there is a great unproductive consumption of capital during the stagnation which follows a period of general overtrading <\s>
<s> establishments are shut up or kept working without any profit <\s>
<s> such are the effects of a commercial revulsion and that such revulsions are almost periodical is a consequence of the very tendency of profits which we are considering <\s>
<s> by the time a few years have passed over without a crisis so much additional capital has been accumulated that it is no longer possible to invest it at the accustomed profit all public securities rise to a high price the rate of interest on the best mercantile security falls very low and the complaint is general among persons in business that no money is to be made <\s>
<s> but the diminished scale of all safe gains inclines persons to give a ready ear to any projects which hold out though at the risk of loss the hope of a higher rate of profit and speculations ensue which with the subsequent revulsions destroy or transfer to foreigners a considerable amount of capital produce a temporary rise of interest and profit make room for fresh accumulations and the same round is recommenced <\s>
<s> this doubtless is one considerable cause which arrests profits in their descent to the minimum by sweeping away from time to time a part of the accumulated mass by which they are forced down <\s>
<s> but this is not as might be inferred from the language of some writers the principal cause <\s>
<s> if it were the capital of the country would not increase but in england it does increase greatly and rapidly <\s>
<s> this is shown by the increasing productiveness of almost all taxes by the continual growth of all the signs of national wealth and by the rapid increase of population while the condition of the laborers certainly is not on the whole declining 301   5 <\s>
<s>    by improvements in production <\s>
<s> this brings us to the second of the counter agencies namely improvements in production <\s>
<s> these evidently have the effect of extending what mr <\s>
<s> wakefield terms the field of employment that is they enable a greater amount of capital to be accumulated and employed without depressing the rate of profit provided always that they do not raise to a proportional extent the habits and requirements of the laborer <\s>
<s> if the laboring class gain the full advantage of the increased cheapness in other words if money wages do not fall profits are not raised nor their fall retarded <\s>
<s> but if the laborers people up to the improvement in their condition and so relapse to their previous state profits will rise <\s>
<s> all inventions which cheapen any of the things consumed by the laborers unless their requirements are raised in an equivalent degree in time lower money wages and by doing so enable a greater capital to be accumulated and employed before profits fall back to what they were previously <\s>
<s> improvements which only affect things consumed exclusively by the richer classes do not operate precisely in the same manner <\s>
<s> the cheapening of lace or velvet has no effect in diminishing the cost of labor and no mode can be pointed out in which it can raise the rate of profit so as to make room for a larger capital before the minimum is attained <\s>
<s> it however produces an effect which is virtually equivalent it lowers or tends to lower the minimum itself <\s>
<s> in the first place increased cheapness of articles of consumption promotes the inclination to save by affording to all consumers a surplus which they may lay by consistently with their accustomed manner of living <\s>
<s> in the next place whatever enables people to live equally well on a smaller income inclines them to lay by capital for a lower rate of profit <\s>
<s> if people can live on an independence of 1,000 a year in the same manner as they formerly could on one of 2,000 some persons will be induced to save in hopes of the one who would have been deterred by the more remote prospect of the other <\s>
<s> all improvements therefore in the production of almost any commodity tend in some degree to widen the interval which has to be passed before arriving at the stationary state <\s>
<s>    by the importation of cheap necessaries and implements <\s>
<s> equivalent in effect to improvements in production is the acquisition of any new power of obtaining cheap commodities from foreign countries <\s>
<s> if necessaries are cheapened whether they are so by improvements at home or importation from abroad is exactly the same thing to wages and profits <\s>
<s> unless the laborer obtains and by an improvement of his habitual standard keeps the whole benefit the cost of labor is lowered and the rate of profit raised <\s>
<s> as long as food can continue to be imported for an increasing population without any diminution of cheapness so long the declension of profits through the increase of population and capital is arrested and accumulation may go on without making the rate of profit draw nearer to the minimum <\s>
<s> and on this ground it is believed by some that the repeal of the corn laws has opened to england a long era of rapid increase of capital with an undiminished rate of profit <\s>
<s> before inquiring whether this expectation is reasonable one remark must be made which is much at variance with commonly received notions <\s>
<s> foreign trade does not necessarily increase the field of employment for capital <\s>
<s> when foreign trade makes room for more capital at the same profit it is by enabling the necessaries of life or the habitual articles of the laborers consumption to be obtained at smaller cost <\s>
<s> it may do this in two ways by the importation either of those commodities themselves or of the means and appliances for producing them <\s>
<s> cheap iron has in a certain measure the same effect on profits and the cost of labor as cheap corn because cheap iron makes cheap tools for agriculture and cheap machinery for clothing <\s>
<s> but a foreign trade which neither directly nor by any indirect consequence increases the cheapness of anything consumed by the laborers does not any more than an invention or discovery in the like case tend to raise profits or retard their fall it merely substitutes the production of goods for foreign markets in the room of the home production of luxuries leaving the employment for capital neither greater nor less than before <\s>
<s> it must of course be supposed that with the increase of capital population also increases for if it did not the consequent rise of wages would bring down profits in spite of any cheapness of food <\s>
<s> suppose then that the population of great britain goes on increasing at its present rate and demands every year a supply of imported food considerably beyond that of the year preceding <\s>
<s> this annual increase in the food demanded from the exporting countries can only be obtained either by great improvements in their agriculture or by the application of a great additional capital to the growth of food <\s>
<s> the former is likely to be a very slow process from the rudeness and ignorance of the agricultural classes in the food exporting countries of europe while the british colonies and the united states are already in possession of most of the improvements yet made so far as suitable to their circumstances <\s>
<s> there remains as a resource the extension of cultivation <\s>
<s> and on this it is to be remarked that the capital by which any such extension can take place is mostly still to be created <\s>
<s> in poland russia hungary spain the increase of capital is extremely slow <\s>
<s> in america it is rapid but not more rapid than the population <\s>
<s> the principal fund at present available for supplying this country with a yearly increasing importation of food is that portion of the annual savings of america which has heretofore been applied to increasing the manufacturing establishments of the united states and which free trade in corn may possibly divert from that purpose to growing food for our market <\s>

<s> the same considerations enable us to throw aside as unworthy of regard one of the common arguments against emigration as a means of relief for the laboring class <\s>

<s> the characteristic property of this class of industrial improvements is the conversion of circulating capital into fixed and it was shown in the first book 303 that in a country where capital accumulates slowly the introduction of machinery permanent improvements of land and the like might be for the time extremely injurious since the capital so employed might be directly taken from the wages fund the subsistence of the people and the employment for labor curtailed and the gross annual produce of the country actually diminished <\s>

<s> an augmentation of capital much more rapid than that of population must soon reach its extreme limit unless accompanied by increased efficiency of labor through inventions and discoveries or improved mental and physical education or unless some of the idle people or of the unproductive laborers became productive <\s>
<s> if population did increase with the increase of capital and in proportion to it the fall of profits would still be inevitable <\s>
<s> increased population implies increased demand for agricultural produce <\s>
<s> in the absence of industrial improvements this demand can only be supplied at an increased cost of production either by cultivating worse land or by a more elaborate and costly cultivation of the land already under tillage <\s>
<s> the cost of the laborers subsistence is therefore increased and unless the laborer submits to a deterioration of his condition profits must fall <\s>
<s> in an old country like england if in addition to supposing all improvement in domestic agriculture suspended we suppose that there is no increased production in foreign countries for the english market the fall of profits would be very rapid <\s>

<s> on the whole therefore we may assume that in such a country as england if the present annual amount of savings were to continue without any of the counteracting circumstances which now keep in check the natural influence of those savings in reducing profit the rate of profit would speedily attain the minimum and all further accumulation of capital would for the present cease <\s>
<s> carey on the other hand asserts the existence of a law of increasing returns from land and that while wages are constantly increasing with the progress of society there is a diminution in the rate of profit although the increasing returns permit an increase of absolute if not of proportional profit <\s>

<s>    prevented from reaching it by commercial revulsions <\s>
<s> what then are these counteracting circumstances which in the existing state of things maintain a tolerably equal struggle against the downward tendency of profits and prevent the great annual savings which take place in this country from depressing the rate of profit much nearer to that lowest point to which it is always tending and which left to itself it would so promptly attain <\s>
<s> the resisting agencies are of several kinds <\s>
<s> first among them is the waste of capital in periods of overtrading and rash speculation and in the commercial revulsions by which such times are always followed <\s>
<s> mines are opened railways or bridges made and many other works of uncertain profit commenced and in these enterprises much capital is sunk which yields either no return or none adequate to the outlay <\s>
<s> factories are built and machinery erected beyond what the market requires or can keep in employment <\s>
<s> even if they are kept in employment the capital is no less sunk it has been converted from circulating into fixed capital and has ceased to have any influence on wages or profits <\s>
<s> besides this there is a great unproductive consumption of capital during the stagnation which follows a period of general overtrading <\s>
<s> establishments are shut up or kept working without any profit <\s>
<s> such are the effects of a commercial revulsion and that such revulsions are almost periodical is a consequence of the very tendency of profits which we are considering <\s>
<s> by the time a few years have passed over without a crisis so much additional capital has been accumulated that it is no longer possible to invest it at the accustomed profit all public securities rise to a high price the rate of interest on the best mercantile security falls very low and the complaint is general among persons in business that no money is to be made <\s>
<s> but the diminished scale of all safe gains inclines persons to give a ready ear to any projects which hold out though at the risk of loss the hope of a higher rate of profit and speculations ensue which with the subsequent revulsions destroy or transfer to foreigners a considerable amount of capital produce a temporary rise of interest and profit make room for fresh accumulations and the same round is recommenced <\s>
<s> this doubtless is one considerable cause which arrests profits in their descent to the minimum by sweeping away from time to time a part of the accumulated mass by which they are forced down <\s>
<s> but this is not as might be inferred from the language of some writers the principal cause <\s>
<s> if it were the capital of the country would not increase but in england it does increase greatly and rapidly <\s>
<s> this is shown by the increasing productiveness of almost all taxes by the continual growth of all the signs of national wealth and by the rapid increase of population while the condition of the laborers certainly is not on the whole declining 301   5 <\s>

<s> this brings us to the second of the counter agencies namely improvements in production <\s>
<s> these evidently have the effect of extending what mr <\s>
<s> wakefield terms the field of employment that is they enable a greater amount of capital to be accumulated and employed without depressing the rate of profit provided always that they do not raise to a proportional extent the habits and requirements of the laborer <\s>
<s> if the laboring class gain the full advantage of the increased cheapness in other words if money wages do not fall profits are not raised nor their fall retarded <\s>
<s> but if the laborers people up to the improvement in their condition and so relapse to their previous state profits will rise <\s>
<s> all inventions which cheapen any of the things consumed by the laborers unless their requirements are raised in an equivalent degree in time lower money wages and by doing so enable a greater capital to be accumulated and employed before profits fall back to what they were previously <\s>
<s> improvements which only affect things consumed exclusively by the richer classes do not operate precisely in the same manner <\s>
<s> the cheapening of lace or velvet has no effect in diminishing the cost of labor and no mode can be pointed out in which it can raise the rate of profit so as to make room for a larger capital before the minimum is attained <\s>
<s> it however produces an effect which is virtually equivalent it lowers or tends to lower the minimum itself <\s>
<s> in the first place increased cheapness of articles of consumption promotes the inclination to save by affording to all consumers a surplus which they may lay by consistently with their accustomed manner of living <\s>
<s> in the next place whatever enables people to live equally well on a smaller income inclines them to lay by capital for a lower rate of profit <\s>
<s> if people can live on an independence of 1,000 a year in the same manner as they formerly could on one of 2,000 some persons will be induced to save in hopes of the one who would have been deterred by the more remote prospect of the other <\s>
<s> all improvements therefore in the production of almost any commodity tend in some degree to widen the interval which has to be passed before arriving at the stationary state <\s>
<s>    by the importation of cheap necessaries and implements <\s>
<s> equivalent in effect to improvements in production is the acquisition of any new power of obtaining cheap commodities from foreign countries <\s>
<s> if necessaries are cheapened whether they are so by improvements at home or importation from abroad is exactly the same thing to wages and profits <\s>

<s> in poor countries the capital of the country requires the legislators sedulous care he is bound to be most cautious of encroaching upon it and should favor to the utmost its accumulation at home and its introduction from abroad <\s>
<s> but in rich populous and highly cultivated countries it is not capital which is the deficient element but fertile land and what the legislator should desire and promote is not a greater aggregate saving but a greater return to savings either by improved cultivation or by access to the produce of more fertile lands in other parts of the globe <\s>
<s> the same considerations enable us to throw aside as unworthy of regard one of the common arguments against emigration as a means of relief for the laboring class <\s>
<s> emigration it is said can do no good to the laborers if in order to defray the cost as much must be taken away from the capital of the country as from its population <\s>

<s> in opulent countries the extension of machinery not detrimental but beneficial to laborers <\s>
<s> from the same principles we are now able to arrive at a final conclusion respecting the effects which machinery and generally the sinking of capital for a productive purpose produce upon the immediate and ultimate interests of the laboring class <\s>
<s> the characteristic property of this class of industrial improvements is the conversion of circulating capital into fixed and it was shown in the first book 303 that in a country where capital accumulates slowly the introduction of machinery permanent improvements of land and the like might be for the time extremely injurious since the capital so employed might be directly taken from the wages fund the subsistence of the people and the employment for labor curtailed and the gross annual produce of the country actually diminished <\s>
<s> now since the conditions of production remain the same the same number of laborers can produce as before no more than a c even though in the second year some of last years profit represented by d b is saved and added to the outlay by the capitalist <\s>
<s> if d c is now the outlay of capital the profit can only be a c minus d c or a d; that is the profit of the second year is diminished by d b exactly the amount of savings of the year before <\s>
<s> and this would be repeated each successive year each saving added to b c being    exactly so much subtracted from the profits of the next and of every following year    it is hardly necessary to say that in such circumstances profits would very soon fall to the point at which further increase of capital would cease <\s>
<s> an augmentation of capital much more rapid than that of population must soon reach its extreme limit unless accompanied by increased efficiency of labor through inventions and discoveries or improved mental and physical education or unless some of the idle people or of the unproductive laborers became productive <\s>
<s> if population did increase with the increase of capital and in proportion to it the fall of profits would still be inevitable <\s>
<s> increased population implies increased demand for agricultural produce <\s>
<s> in the absence of industrial improvements this demand can only be supplied at an increased cost of production either by cultivating worse land or by a more elaborate and costly cultivation of the land already under tillage <\s>
<s> the cost of the laborers subsistence is therefore increased and unless the laborer submits to a deterioration of his condition profits must fall <\s>
<s> in an old country like england if in addition to supposing all improvement in domestic agriculture suspended we suppose that there is no increased production in foreign countries for the english market the fall of profits would be very rapid <\s>
<s> if both these avenues to an increased supply of food were closed and population continued to increase as it is said to do at the rate of a thousand a day all waste land which admits of cultivation in the existing state of knowledge would soon be cultivated and the cost of production and price of food would be so increased that if the laborers received the increased money wages necessary to compensate for their increased expenses profits would very soon reach the minimum <\s>
<s> the fall of profits would be retarded if money wages did not rise or rose in a less degree but the margin which can be gained by a deterioration of the laborers    condition is a very narrow one in general they can not bear much reduction when they can they have also a higher standard of necessary requirements and will not <\s>
<s> on the whole therefore we may assume that in such a country as england if the present annual amount of savings were to continue without any of the counteracting circumstances which now keep in check the natural influence of those savings in reducing profit the rate of profit would speedily attain the minimum and all further accumulation of capital would for the present cease <\s>
<s> carey on the other hand asserts the existence of a law of increasing returns from land and that while wages are constantly increasing with the progress of society there is a diminution in the rate of profit although the increasing returns permit an increase of absolute if not of proportional profit <\s>
<s> that is although wages increase more in proportion than profit there is still a larger gross amount to be divided among capitalists as profit out of a larger product <\s>
<s>    prevented from reaching it by commercial revulsions <\s>
<s> what then are these counteracting circumstances which in the existing state of things maintain a tolerably equal struggle against the downward tendency of profits and prevent the great annual savings which take place in this country from depressing the rate of profit much nearer to that lowest point to which it is always tending and which left to itself it would so promptly attain <\s>
<s> the resisting agencies are of several kinds <\s>
<s> first among them is the waste of capital in periods of overtrading and rash speculation and in the commercial revulsions by which such times are always followed <\s>
<s> mines are opened railways or bridges made and many other works of uncertain profit commenced and in these enterprises much capital is sunk which yields either no return or none adequate to the outlay <\s>
<s> factories are built and machinery erected beyond what the market requires or can keep in employment <\s>
<s> even if they are kept in employment the capital is no less sunk it has been converted from circulating into fixed capital and has ceased to have any influence on wages or profits <\s>
<s> besides this there is a great unproductive consumption of capital during the stagnation which follows a period of general overtrading <\s>
<s> establishments are shut up or kept working without any profit <\s>
<s> such are the effects of a commercial revulsion and that such revulsions are almost periodical is a consequence of the very tendency of profits which we are considering <\s>
<s> by the time a few years have passed over without a crisis so much additional capital has been accumulated that it is no longer possible to invest it at the accustomed profit all public securities rise to a high price the rate of interest on the best mercantile security falls very low and the complaint is general among persons in business that no money is to be made <\s>
<s> but the diminished scale of all safe gains inclines persons to give a ready ear to any projects which hold out though at the risk of loss the hope of a higher rate of profit and speculations ensue which with the subsequent revulsions destroy or transfer to foreigners a considerable amount of capital produce a temporary rise of interest and profit make room for fresh accumulations and the same round is recommenced <\s>

<s> in the first place then this view of things greatly weakens in a wealthy and industrious country the force of the economical argument against the expenditure of public money for really valuable even though industriously unproductive purposes <\s>
<s> in poor countries the capital of the country requires the legislators sedulous care he is bound to be most cautious of encroaching upon it and should favor to the utmost its accumulation at home and its introduction from abroad <\s>

<s> the same considerations enable us to throw aside as unworthy of regard one of the common arguments against emigration as a means of relief for the laboring class <\s>
<s> emigration it is said can do no good to the laborers if in order to defray the cost as much must be taken away from the capital of the country as from its population <\s>

<s> in opulent countries the extension of machinery not detrimental but beneficial to laborers <\s>
<s> from the same principles we are now able to arrive at a final conclusion respecting the effects which machinery and generally the sinking of capital for a productive purpose produce upon the immediate and ultimate interests of the laboring class <\s>
<s> the characteristic property of this class of industrial improvements is the conversion of circulating capital into fixed and it was shown in the first book 303 that in a country where capital accumulates slowly the introduction of machinery permanent improvements of land and the like might be for the time extremely injurious since the capital so employed might be directly taken from the wages fund the subsistence of the people and the employment for labor curtailed and the gross annual produce of the country actually diminished <\s>
<s> now since the conditions of production remain the same the same number of laborers can produce as before no more than a c even though in the second year some of last years profit represented by d b is saved and added to the outlay by the capitalist <\s>

<s> and this would be repeated each successive year each saving added to b c being    exactly so much subtracted from the profits of the next and of every following year    it is hardly necessary to say that in such circumstances profits would very soon fall to the point at which further increase of capital would cease <\s>
<s> an augmentation of capital much more rapid than that of population must soon reach its extreme limit unless accompanied by increased efficiency of labor through inventions and discoveries or improved mental and physical education or unless some of the idle people or of the unproductive laborers became productive <\s>
<s> if population did increase with the increase of capital and in proportion to it the fall of profits would still be inevitable <\s>
<s> increased population implies increased demand for agricultural produce <\s>
<s> in the absence of industrial improvements this demand can only be supplied at an increased cost of production either by cultivating worse land or by a more elaborate and costly cultivation of the land already under tillage <\s>
<s> the cost of the laborers subsistence is therefore increased and unless the laborer submits to a deterioration of his condition profits must fall <\s>
<s> in an old country like england if in addition to supposing all improvement in domestic agriculture suspended we suppose that there is no increased production in foreign countries for the english market the fall of profits would be very rapid <\s>

<s> if one tenth of the laboring people of england were transferred to the colonies and along with them one tenth of the circulating capital of the country either wages or profits or both would be greatly benefited by the diminished pressure of capital and population upon the fertility of the land <\s>
<s> the landlords alone would sustain some loss of income and even they only if colonization went to the length of actually diminishing capital and population but not if it merely carried off the annual increase <\s>
<s> in opulent countries the extension of machinery not detrimental but beneficial to laborers <\s>
<s> from the same principles we are now able to arrive at a final conclusion respecting the effects which machinery and generally the sinking of capital for a productive purpose produce upon the immediate and ultimate interests of the laboring class <\s>
<s> the characteristic property of this class of industrial improvements is the conversion of circulating capital into fixed and it was shown in the first book 303 that in a country where capital accumulates slowly the introduction of machinery permanent improvements of land and the like might be for the time extremely injurious since the capital so employed might be directly taken from the wages fund the subsistence of the people and the employment for labor curtailed and the gross annual produce of the country actually diminished <\s>
<s> now since the conditions of production remain the same the same number of laborers can produce as before no more than a c even though in the second year some of last years profit represented by d b is saved and added to the outlay by the capitalist <\s>
<s> if d c is now the outlay of capital the profit can only be a c minus d c or a d; that is the profit of the second year is diminished by d b exactly the amount of savings of the year before <\s>
<s> and this would be repeated each successive year each saving added to b c being    exactly so much subtracted from the profits of the next and of every following year    it is hardly necessary to say that in such circumstances profits would very soon fall to the point at which further increase of capital would cease <\s>
<s> an augmentation of capital much more rapid than that of population must soon reach its extreme limit unless accompanied by increased efficiency of labor through inventions and discoveries or improved mental and physical education or unless some of the idle people or of the unproductive laborers became productive <\s>
<s> if population did increase with the increase of capital and in proportion to it the fall of profits would still be inevitable <\s>
<s> increased population implies increased demand for agricultural produce <\s>
<s> in the absence of industrial improvements this demand can only be supplied at an increased cost of production either by cultivating worse land or by a more elaborate and costly cultivation of the land already under tillage <\s>
<s> the cost of the laborers subsistence is therefore increased and unless the laborer submits to a deterioration of his condition profits must fall <\s>
<s> in an old country like england if in addition to supposing all improvement in domestic agriculture suspended we suppose that there is no increased production in foreign countries for the english market the fall of profits would be very rapid <\s>
<s> if both these avenues to an increased supply of food were closed and population continued to increase as it is said to do at the rate of a thousand a day all waste land which admits of cultivation in the existing state of knowledge would soon be cultivated and the cost of production and price of food would be so increased that if the laborers received the increased money wages necessary to compensate for their increased expenses profits would very soon reach the minimum <\s>
<s> the fall of profits would be retarded if money wages did not rise or rose in a less degree but the margin which can be gained by a deterioration of the laborers    condition is a very narrow one in general they can not bear much reduction when they can they have also a higher standard of necessary requirements and will not <\s>
<s> on the whole therefore we may assume that in such a country as england if the present annual amount of savings were to continue without any of the counteracting circumstances which now keep in check the natural influence of those savings in reducing profit the rate of profit would speedily attain the minimum and all further accumulation of capital would for the present cease <\s>
<s> carey on the other hand asserts the existence of a law of increasing returns from land and that while wages are constantly increasing with the progress of society there is a diminution in the rate of profit although the increasing returns permit an increase of absolute if not of proportional profit <\s>
<s> that is although wages increase more in proportion than profit there is still a larger gross amount to be divided among capitalists as profit out of a larger product <\s>
<s>    prevented from reaching it by commercial revulsions <\s>
<s> what then are these counteracting circumstances which in the existing state of things maintain a tolerably equal struggle against the downward tendency of profits and prevent the great annual savings which take place in this country from depressing the rate of profit much nearer to that lowest point to which it is always tending and which left to itself it would so promptly attain <\s>
<s> the resisting agencies are of several kinds <\s>
<s> first among them is the waste of capital in periods of overtrading and rash speculation and in the commercial revulsions by which such times are always followed <\s>
<s> mines are opened railways or bridges made and many other works of uncertain profit commenced and in these enterprises much capital is sunk which yields either no return or none adequate to the outlay <\s>
<s> factories are built and machinery erected beyond what the market requires or can keep in employment <\s>
<s> even if they are kept in employment the capital is no less sunk it has been converted from circulating into fixed capital and has ceased to have any influence on wages or profits <\s>
<s> besides this there is a great unproductive consumption of capital during the stagnation which follows a period of general overtrading <\s>
<s> establishments are shut up or kept working without any profit <\s>
<s> such are the effects of a commercial revulsion and that such revulsions are almost periodical is a consequence of the very tendency of profits which we are considering <\s>
<s> by the time a few years have passed over without a crisis so much additional capital has been accumulated that it is no longer possible to invest it at the accustomed profit all public securities rise to a high price the rate of interest on the best mercantile security falls very low and the complaint is general among persons in business that no money is to be made <\s>
<s> but the diminished scale of all safe gains inclines persons to give a ready ear to any projects which hold out though at the risk of loss the hope of a higher rate of profit and speculations ensue which with the subsequent revulsions destroy or transfer to foreigners a considerable amount of capital produce a temporary rise of interest and profit make room for fresh accumulations and the same round is recommenced <\s>
<s> this doubtless is one considerable cause which arrests profits in their descent to the minimum by sweeping away from time to time a part of the accumulated mass by which they are forced down <\s>
<s> but this is not as might be inferred from the language of some writers the principal cause <\s>
<s> if it were the capital of the country would not increase but in england it does increase greatly and rapidly <\s>
<s> this is shown by the increasing productiveness of almost all taxes by the continual growth of all the signs of national wealth and by the rapid increase of population while the condition of the laborers certainly is not on the whole declining 301   5 <\s>
<s>    by improvements in production <\s>
<s> this brings us to the second of the counter agencies namely improvements in production <\s>
<s> these evidently have the effect of extending what mr <\s>
<s> wakefield terms the field of employment that is they enable a greater amount of capital to be accumulated and employed without depressing the rate of profit provided always that they do not raise to a proportional extent the habits and requirements of the laborer <\s>
<s> if the laboring class gain the full advantage of the increased cheapness in other words if money wages do not fall profits are not raised nor their fall retarded <\s>
<s> but if the laborers people up to the improvement in their condition and so relapse to their previous state profits will rise <\s>
<s> all inventions which cheapen any of the things consumed by the laborers unless their requirements are raised in an equivalent degree in time lower money wages and by doing so enable a greater capital to be accumulated and employed before profits fall back to what they were previously <\s>
<s> improvements which only affect things consumed exclusively by the richer classes do not operate precisely in the same manner <\s>
<s> the cheapening of lace or velvet has no effect in diminishing the cost of labor and no mode can be pointed out in which it can raise the rate of profit so as to make room for a larger capital before the minimum is attained <\s>
<s> it however produces an effect which is virtually equivalent it lowers or tends to lower the minimum itself <\s>
<s> in the first place increased cheapness of articles of consumption promotes the inclination to save by affording to all consumers a surplus which they may lay by consistently with their accustomed manner of living <\s>
<s> in the next place whatever enables people to live equally well on a smaller income inclines them to lay by capital for a lower rate of profit <\s>
<s> if people can live on an independence of 1,000 a year in the same manner as they formerly could on one of 2,000 some persons will be induced to save in hopes of the one who would have been deterred by the more remote prospect of the other <\s>
<s> all improvements therefore in the production of almost any commodity tend in some degree to widen the interval which has to be passed before arriving at the stationary state <\s>
<s>    by the importation of cheap necessaries and implements <\s>
<s> equivalent in effect to improvements in production is the acquisition of any new power of obtaining cheap commodities from foreign countries <\s>
<s> if necessaries are cheapened whether they are so by improvements at home or importation from abroad is exactly the same thing to wages and profits <\s>
<s> unless the laborer obtains and by an improvement of his habitual standard keeps the whole benefit the cost of labor is lowered and the rate of profit raised <\s>
<s> as long as food can continue to be imported for an increasing population without any diminution of cheapness so long the declension of profits through the increase of population and capital is arrested and accumulation may go on without making the rate of profit draw nearer to the minimum <\s>
<s> and on this ground it is believed by some that the repeal of the corn laws has opened to england a long era of rapid increase of capital with an undiminished rate of profit <\s>
<s> before inquiring whether this expectation is reasonable one remark must be made which is much at variance with commonly received notions <\s>
<s> foreign trade does not necessarily increase the field of employment for capital <\s>
<s> when foreign trade makes room for more capital at the same profit it is by enabling the necessaries of life or the habitual articles of the laborers consumption to be obtained at smaller cost <\s>
<s> it may do this in two ways by the importation either of those commodities themselves or of the means and appliances for producing them <\s>
<s> cheap iron has in a certain measure the same effect on profits and the cost of labor as cheap corn because cheap iron makes cheap tools for agriculture and cheap machinery for clothing <\s>
<s> but a foreign trade which neither directly nor by any indirect consequence increases the cheapness of anything consumed by the laborers does not any more than an invention or discovery in the like case tend to raise profits or retard their fall it merely substitutes the production of goods for foreign markets in the room of the home production of luxuries leaving the employment for capital neither greater nor less than before <\s>
<s> it must of course be supposed that with the increase of capital population also increases for if it did not the consequent rise of wages would bring down profits in spite of any cheapness of food <\s>
<s> suppose then that the population of great britain goes on increasing at its present rate and demands every year a supply of imported food considerably beyond that of the year preceding <\s>
<s> this annual increase in the food demanded from the exporting countries can only be obtained either by great improvements in their agriculture or by the application of a great additional capital to the growth of food <\s>
<s> the former is likely to be a very slow process from the rudeness and ignorance of the agricultural classes in the food exporting countries of europe while the british colonies and the united states are already in possession of most of the improvements yet made so far as suitable to their circumstances <\s>
<s> there remains as a resource the extension of cultivation <\s>
<s> and on this it is to be remarked that the capital by which any such extension can take place is mostly still to be created <\s>
<s> in poland russia hungary spain the increase of capital is extremely slow <\s>
<s> in america it is rapid but not more rapid than the population <\s>
<s> the principal fund at present available for supplying this country with a yearly increasing importation of food is that portion of the annual savings of america which has heretofore been applied to increasing the manufacturing establishments of the united states and which free trade in corn may possibly divert from that purpose to growing food for our market <\s>
<s> this limited source of supply unless great improvements take place in agriculture can not be expected to keep pace with the growing demand of so rapidly increasing a population as that of great britain and if our population and capital continue to increase with their present rapidity the only mode in which food can continue to be supplied cheaply to the one is by sending the other abroad to produce it <\s>

<s> this is the perpetual overflow of capital into colonies or foreign countries to seek higher profits than can be obtained at home <\s>
<s> i believe this to have been for many years one of the principal causes by which the decline of profits in england has been arrested <\s>
<s> it has a twofold operation in the first place it does what a fire or an inundation or a commercial crisis would have doneit carries off a part of the increase of capital from which the reduction of profits proceeds secondly the capital so carried off is not lost but is chiefly employed either in founding colonies which become large exporters of cheap agricultural produce or in extending and perhaps improving the agriculture of older communities <\s>
<s> in countries which are further advanced in industry and population and have therefore a lower rate of profit than others there is always long before the actual minimum is reached a practical minimum viz when profits have fallen so much below what they are elsewhere that were they to fall lower all further accumulations would go abroad <\s>
<s> as long as there are old countries where capital increases very rapidly and new countries where profit is still high profits in the old countries will not sink to the rate which would put a stop to accumulation the fall is stopped at the point which sends capital abroad <\s>
<s> consequences of the tendency of profits to a minimum and the stationary state <\s>
<s> abstraction of capital not necessarily a national loss <\s>
<s> the theory of the effect of accumulation on profits must greatly abate or rather altogether destroy in countries where profits are low the immense importance which used to be attached by political economists to the effects which an event or a measure of government might have in adding to or subtracting from the capital of the country <\s>
<s> we have now seen that the lowness of profits is a proof that the spirit of accumulation is so active and that the increase of capital has proceeded at so rapid a rate as to outstrip the two counter agencies improvements in production and increased supply of cheap necessaries from abroad <\s>
<s> a sudden abstraction of capital unless of inordinate amount would not have any real effect in impoverishing the country <\s>
<s> after a few months or years there would exist in the country just as much capital as if none had been taken away <\s>
<s> the abstraction by raising profits and interest would give a fresh stimulus to the accumulative principle which would speedily fill up the vacuum <\s>
<s> probably indeed the only effect that would ensue would be that for some time afterward less capital would be exported and less thrown away in hazardous speculation <\s>
<s> in the first place then this view of things greatly weakens in a wealthy and industrious country the force of the economical argument against the expenditure of public money for really valuable even though industriously unproductive purposes <\s>
<s> in poor countries the capital of the country requires the legislators sedulous care he is bound to be most cautious of encroaching upon it and should favor to the utmost its accumulation at home and its introduction from abroad <\s>

<s> it has a twofold operation in the first place it does what a fire or an inundation or a commercial crisis would have doneit carries off a part of the increase of capital from which the reduction of profits proceeds secondly the capital so carried off is not lost but is chiefly employed either in founding colonies which become large exporters of cheap agricultural produce or in extending and perhaps improving the agriculture of older communities <\s>
<s> in countries which are further advanced in industry and population and have therefore a lower rate of profit than others there is always long before the actual minimum is reached a practical minimum viz when profits have fallen so much below what they are elsewhere that were they to fall lower all further accumulations would go abroad <\s>
<s> as long as there are old countries where capital increases very rapidly and new countries where profit is still high profits in the old countries will not sink to the rate which would put a stop to accumulation the fall is stopped at the point which sends capital abroad <\s>
<s> consequences of the tendency of profits to a minimum and the stationary state <\s>
<s> abstraction of capital not necessarily a national loss <\s>
<s> the theory of the effect of accumulation on profits must greatly abate or rather altogether destroy in countries where profits are low the immense importance which used to be attached by political economists to the effects which an event or a measure of government might have in adding to or subtracting from the capital of the country <\s>
<s> we have now seen that the lowness of profits is a proof that the spirit of accumulation is so active and that the increase of capital has proceeded at so rapid a rate as to outstrip the two counter agencies improvements in production and increased supply of cheap necessaries from abroad <\s>
<s> a sudden abstraction of capital unless of inordinate amount would not have any real effect in impoverishing the country <\s>
<s> after a few months or years there would exist in the country just as much capital as if none had been taken away <\s>
<s> the abstraction by raising profits and interest would give a fresh stimulus to the accumulative principle which would speedily fill up the vacuum <\s>
<s> probably indeed the only effect that would ensue would be that for some time afterward less capital would be exported and less thrown away in hazardous speculation <\s>
<s> in the first place then this view of things greatly weakens in a wealthy and industrious country the force of the economical argument against the expenditure of public money for really valuable even though industriously unproductive purposes <\s>
<s> in poor countries the capital of the country requires the legislators sedulous care he is bound to be most cautious of encroaching upon it and should favor to the utmost its accumulation at home and its introduction from abroad <\s>
<s> but in rich populous and highly cultivated countries it is not capital which is the deficient element but fertile land and what the legislator should desire and promote is not a greater aggregate saving but a greater return to savings either by improved cultivation or by access to the produce of more fertile lands in other parts of the globe <\s>
<s> the same considerations enable us to throw aside as unworthy of regard one of the common arguments against emigration as a means of relief for the laboring class <\s>
<s> emigration it is said can do no good to the laborers if in order to defray the cost as much must be taken away from the capital of the country as from its population <\s>
<s> if one tenth of the laboring people of england were transferred to the colonies and along with them one tenth of the circulating capital of the country either wages or profits or both would be greatly benefited by the diminished pressure of capital and population upon the fertility of the land <\s>
<s> the landlords alone would sustain some loss of income and even they only if colonization went to the length of actually diminishing capital and population but not if it merely carried off the annual increase <\s>
<s> in opulent countries the extension of machinery not detrimental but beneficial to laborers <\s>
<s> from the same principles we are now able to arrive at a final conclusion respecting the effects which machinery and generally the sinking of capital for a productive purpose produce upon the immediate and ultimate interests of the laboring class <\s>
<s> the characteristic property of this class of industrial improvements is the conversion of circulating capital into fixed and it was shown in the first book 303 that in a country where capital accumulates slowly the introduction of machinery permanent improvements of land and the like might be for the time extremely injurious since the capital so employed might be directly taken from the wages fund the subsistence of the people and the employment for labor curtailed and the gross annual produce of the country actually diminished <\s>

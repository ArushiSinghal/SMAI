<s> xix that the average production of each operative constantly increased from 4,321 yards per year in 1830 to 28,032 yards in 1884 and this it was which made possible the corresponding increase in the rate of wages from 164 in 1830 to 290 in 1884 <\s>
<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>

<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>
<s> what must be the ultimate outlook for wages receivers <\s>
<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>
<s> if then the gain arising from improvements is largely passed to the credit of land owners as mr <\s>
<s> cairnes believes it should be absolutely necessary to spread among the working classes the doctrine that if they own their own homes and buy the land they live on to that extent will they    grow rich while they sleep    independently of their other exertions <\s>
<s> land worth 500 to day when bought by the savings of a laborer besides the self respect 315 it gives him will increase in value with the density of population and become worth 600 or more without other sacrifice of his <\s>
<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>

<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>

<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>
<s> the gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to saving habits and greater regularity of work <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>

<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>

<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>

<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>
<s> number of members 90,000 525,000 capital share 428,000 5,881 000 capital loan 55,000 1,267 000 sales 2,333 000 20,901 000 net profit 165,000 1,617 000 several persons each subscribe a sum to make up the share capital of a store and a person is selected to take charge of the purchase and care of the goods <\s>
<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>

<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>

<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>

<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>

<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>

<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>

<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>

<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>

<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>

<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>

<s> in 1874 they had a share capital of 375,000 all subscribed except 1,000 and an equal amount of loan capital while the whole plant was estimated as worth 615,000 <\s>
<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>
<s> the last annual report of the co operative congress 1882 shows the existence in england and scotland of productive associations for the manufacture of cloth flannel fustian hosiery quilts worsted nails watches linen and silk as well as those for engineering printing and quarrying and these were but a few of them 327 in the united states there have been some successes as well as failures <\s>
<s> in january 1872 a number of machinists and other working men organized in the town of beaver falls pennsylvania a co operative foundry association for the manufacture of stoves hollow ware and fine castings <\s>
<s> on a small capital of only 4,000 they have steadily prospered paid the market rate of wages and also paid annual dividends over and above all expenses and interest on the plant of from twelve to fifteen per cent <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>
<s> the gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to saving habits and greater regularity of work <\s>
<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>
<s> briggs at their collieries in yorkshire england 330 the relations between the owners and the laborers were as bad as they could well be <\s>
<s> xix that the average production of each operative constantly increased from 4,321 yards per year in 1830 to 28,032 yards in 1884 and this it was which made possible the corresponding increase in the rate of wages from 164 in 1830 to 290 in 1884 <\s>
<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>

<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>

<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>
<s> briggs at their collieries in yorkshire england 330 the relations between the owners and the laborers were as bad as they could well be <\s>
<s> xix that the average production of each operative constantly increased from 4,321 yards per year in 1830 to 28,032 yards in 1884 and this it was which made possible the corresponding increase in the rate of wages from 164 in 1830 to 290 in 1884 <\s>
<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>
<s> what must be the ultimate outlook for wages receivers <\s>
<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>
<s> if then the gain arising from improvements is largely passed to the credit of land owners as mr <\s>
<s> cairnes believes it should be absolutely necessary to spread among the working classes the doctrine that if they own their own homes and buy the land they live on to that extent will they    grow rich while they sleep    independently of their other exertions <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>
<s> number of members 90,000 525,000 capital share 428,000 5,881 000 capital loan 55,000 1,267 000 sales 2,333 000 20,901 000 net profit 165,000 1,617 000 several persons each subscribe a sum to make up the share capital of a store and a person is selected to take charge of the purchase and care of the goods <\s>
<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>

<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>

<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>

<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>
<s> number of members 90,000 525,000 capital share 428,000 5,881 000 capital loan 55,000 1,267 000 sales 2,333 000 20,901 000 net profit 165,000 1,617 000 several persons each subscribe a sum to make up the share capital of a store and a person is selected to take charge of the purchase and care of the goods <\s>
<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>

<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>

<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>

<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>
<s> what must be the ultimate outlook for wages receivers <\s>
<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>

<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>

<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>

<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>

<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>
<s> beginning with a share capital of 250,000 and a loan capital of a like amount it set 80,000 spindles in operation <\s>
<s> in 1874 they had a share capital of 375,000 all subscribed except 1,000 and an equal amount of loan capital while the whole plant was estimated as worth 615,000 <\s>
<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>
<s> the last annual report of the co operative congress 1882 shows the existence in england and scotland of productive associations for the manufacture of cloth flannel fustian hosiery quilts worsted nails watches linen and silk as well as those for engineering printing and quarrying and these were but a few of them 327 in the united states there have been some successes as well as failures <\s>
<s> in january 1872 a number of machinists and other working men organized in the town of beaver falls pennsylvania a co operative foundry association for the manufacture of stoves hollow ware and fine castings <\s>
<s> on a small capital of only 4,000 they have steadily prospered paid the market rate of wages and also paid annual dividends over and above all expenses and interest on the plant of from twelve to fifteen per cent <\s>

<s> in 1876 it had a capital of 30,000 and a surplus fund of 28,924 328   6 <\s>
<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>
<s> the gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to saving habits and greater regularity of work <\s>
<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>
<s> briggs at their collieries in yorkshire england 330 the relations between the owners and the laborers were as bad as they could well be <\s>
<s> xix that the average production of each operative constantly increased from 4,321 yards per year in 1830 to 28,032 yards in 1884 and this it was which made possible the corresponding increase in the rate of wages from 164 in 1830 to 290 in 1884 <\s>
<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>
<s> what must be the ultimate outlook for wages receivers <\s>
<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>
<s> if then the gain arising from improvements is largely passed to the credit of land owners as mr <\s>
<s> cairnes believes it should be absolutely necessary to spread among the working classes the doctrine that if they own their own homes and buy the land they live on to that extent will they    grow rich while they sleep    independently of their other exertions <\s>
<s> land worth 500 to day when bought by the savings of a laborer besides the self respect 315 it gives him will increase in value with the density of population and become worth 600 or more without other sacrifice of his <\s>
<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>

<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>

<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>

<s> in 1874 they had a share capital of 375,000 all subscribed except 1,000 and an equal amount of loan capital while the whole plant was estimated as worth 615,000 <\s>
<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>
<s> the last annual report of the co operative congress 1882 shows the existence in england and scotland of productive associations for the manufacture of cloth flannel fustian hosiery quilts worsted nails watches linen and silk as well as those for engineering printing and quarrying and these were but a few of them 327 in the united states there have been some successes as well as failures <\s>
<s> in january 1872 a number of machinists and other working men organized in the town of beaver falls pennsylvania a co operative foundry association for the manufacture of stoves hollow ware and fine castings <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>
<s> the gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to saving habits and greater regularity of work <\s>
<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>
<s> briggs at their collieries in yorkshire england 330 the relations between the owners and the laborers were as bad as they could well be <\s>
<s> xix that the average production of each operative constantly increased from 4,321 yards per year in 1830 to 28,032 yards in 1884 and this it was which made possible the corresponding increase in the rate of wages from 164 in 1830 to 290 in 1884 <\s>
<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>
<s> the gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to saving habits and greater regularity of work <\s>
<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>
<s> briggs at their collieries in yorkshire england 330 the relations between the owners and the laborers were as bad as they could well be <\s>
<s> xix that the average production of each operative constantly increased from 4,321 yards per year in 1830 to 28,032 yards in 1884 and this it was which made possible the corresponding increase in the rate of wages from 164 in 1830 to 290 in 1884 <\s>
<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>
<s> what must be the ultimate outlook for wages receivers <\s>
<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>
<s> if then the gain arising from improvements is largely passed to the credit of land owners as mr <\s>
<s> cairnes believes it should be absolutely necessary to spread among the working classes the doctrine that if they own their own homes and buy the land they live on to that extent will they    grow rich while they sleep    independently of their other exertions <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>
<s> number of members 90,000 525,000 capital share 428,000 5,881 000 capital loan 55,000 1,267 000 sales 2,333 000 20,901 000 net profit 165,000 1,617 000 several persons each subscribe a sum to make up the share capital of a store and a person is selected to take charge of the purchase and care of the goods <\s>
<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>
<s> beginning with a share capital of 250,000 and a loan capital of a like amount it set 80,000 spindles in operation <\s>
<s> in 1874 they had a share capital of 375,000 all subscribed except 1,000 and an equal amount of loan capital while the whole plant was estimated as worth 615,000 <\s>
<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>

<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>

<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>

<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>

<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>
<s> number of members 90,000 525,000 capital share 428,000 5,881 000 capital loan 55,000 1,267 000 sales 2,333 000 20,901 000 net profit 165,000 1,617 000 several persons each subscribe a sum to make up the share capital of a store and a person is selected to take charge of the purchase and care of the goods <\s>
<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>

<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>

<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>

<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>

<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>

<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>

<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>
<s> number of members 90,000 525,000 capital share 428,000 5,881 000 capital loan 55,000 1,267 000 sales 2,333 000 20,901 000 net profit 165,000 1,617 000 several persons each subscribe a sum to make up the share capital of a store and a person is selected to take charge of the purchase and care of the goods <\s>
<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>
<s> beginning with a share capital of 250,000 and a loan capital of a like amount it set 80,000 spindles in operation <\s>
<s> in 1874 they had a share capital of 375,000 all subscribed except 1,000 and an equal amount of loan capital while the whole plant was estimated as worth 615,000 <\s>
<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>
<s> the last annual report of the co operative congress 1882 shows the existence in england and scotland of productive associations for the manufacture of cloth flannel fustian hosiery quilts worsted nails watches linen and silk as well as those for engineering printing and quarrying and these were but a few of them 327 in the united states there have been some successes as well as failures <\s>
<s> in january 1872 a number of machinists and other working men organized in the town of beaver falls pennsylvania a co operative foundry association for the manufacture of stoves hollow ware and fine castings <\s>
<s> on a small capital of only 4,000 they have steadily prospered paid the market rate of wages and also paid annual dividends over and above all expenses and interest on the plant of from twelve to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> in 1867 thirty workmen started a co operative foundry in somerset massachusetts with a capital of about 14,000 <\s>
<s> in the years 1874 1875 the company spent 5,400 for new flasks and patterns and yet showed a net gain of 11,914 <\s>
<s> in 1876 it had a capital of 30,000 and a surplus fund of 28,924 328   6 <\s>
<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>
<s> the gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to saving habits and greater regularity of work <\s>
<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>
<s> briggs at their collieries in yorkshire england 330 the relations between the owners and the laborers were as bad as they could well be <\s>
<s> xix that the average production of each operative constantly increased from 4,321 yards per year in 1830 to 28,032 yards in 1884 and this it was which made possible the corresponding increase in the rate of wages from 164 in 1830 to 290 in 1884 <\s>
<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>
<s> what must be the ultimate outlook for wages receivers <\s>
<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>
<s> if then the gain arising from improvements is largely passed to the credit of land owners as mr <\s>
<s> cairnes believes it should be absolutely necessary to spread among the working classes the doctrine that if they own their own homes and buy the land they live on to that extent will they    grow rich while they sleep    independently of their other exertions <\s>
<s> land worth 500 to day when bought by the savings of a laborer besides the self respect 315 it gives him will increase in value with the density of population and become worth 600 or more without other sacrifice of his <\s>
<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>

<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>

<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>

<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>
<s> beginning with a share capital of 250,000 and a loan capital of a like amount it set 80,000 spindles in operation <\s>
<s> in 1874 they had a share capital of 375,000 all subscribed except 1,000 and an equal amount of loan capital while the whole plant was estimated as worth 615,000 <\s>
<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>
<s> the last annual report of the co operative congress 1882 shows the existence in england and scotland of productive associations for the manufacture of cloth flannel fustian hosiery quilts worsted nails watches linen and silk as well as those for engineering printing and quarrying and these were but a few of them 327 in the united states there have been some successes as well as failures <\s>
<s> in january 1872 a number of machinists and other working men organized in the town of beaver falls pennsylvania a co operative foundry association for the manufacture of stoves hollow ware and fine castings <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>
<s> the gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to saving habits and greater regularity of work <\s>
<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>
<s> briggs at their collieries in yorkshire england 330 the relations between the owners and the laborers were as bad as they could well be <\s>
<s> xix that the average production of each operative constantly increased from 4,321 yards per year in 1830 to 28,032 yards in 1884 and this it was which made possible the corresponding increase in the rate of wages from 164 in 1830 to 290 in 1884 <\s>
<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>
<s> the gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to saving habits and greater regularity of work <\s>
<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>
<s> briggs at their collieries in yorkshire england 330 the relations between the owners and the laborers were as bad as they could well be <\s>
<s> xix that the average production of each operative constantly increased from 4,321 yards per year in 1830 to 28,032 yards in 1884 and this it was which made possible the corresponding increase in the rate of wages from 164 in 1830 to 290 in 1884 <\s>
<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>
<s> what must be the ultimate outlook for wages receivers <\s>
<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>
<s> if then the gain arising from improvements is largely passed to the credit of land owners as mr <\s>
<s> cairnes believes it should be absolutely necessary to spread among the working classes the doctrine that if they own their own homes and buy the land they live on to that extent will they    grow rich while they sleep    independently of their other exertions <\s>
<s> land worth 500 to day when bought by the savings of a laborer besides the self respect 315 it gives him will increase in value with the density of population and become worth 600 or more without other sacrifice of his <\s>
<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>
<s> number of members 90,000 525,000 capital share 428,000 5,881 000 capital loan 55,000 1,267 000 sales 2,333 000 20,901 000 net profit 165,000 1,617 000 several persons each subscribe a sum to make up the share capital of a store and a person is selected to take charge of the purchase and care of the goods <\s>
<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>
<s> beginning with a share capital of 250,000 and a loan capital of a like amount it set 80,000 spindles in operation <\s>
<s> in 1874 they had a share capital of 375,000 all subscribed except 1,000 and an equal amount of loan capital while the whole plant was estimated as worth 615,000 <\s>
<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>

<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>

<s> in 1874 they had a share capital of 375,000 all subscribed except 1,000 and an equal amount of loan capital while the whole plant was estimated as worth 615,000 <\s>
<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>
<s> the gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to saving habits and greater regularity of work <\s>
<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>

<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>

<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>

<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>

<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>

<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>

<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>
<s> the gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to saving habits and greater regularity of work <\s>
<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>

<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>
<s> what must be the ultimate outlook for wages receivers <\s>
<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>

<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>
<s> number of members 90,000 525,000 capital share 428,000 5,881 000 capital loan 55,000 1,267 000 sales 2,333 000 20,901 000 net profit 165,000 1,617 000 several persons each subscribe a sum to make up the share capital of a store and a person is selected to take charge of the purchase and care of the goods <\s>
<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>
<s> beginning with a share capital of 250,000 and a loan capital of a like amount it set 80,000 spindles in operation <\s>
<s> in 1874 they had a share capital of 375,000 all subscribed except 1,000 and an equal amount of loan capital while the whole plant was estimated as worth 615,000 <\s>
<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>
<s> the last annual report of the co operative congress 1882 shows the existence in england and scotland of productive associations for the manufacture of cloth flannel fustian hosiery quilts worsted nails watches linen and silk as well as those for engineering printing and quarrying and these were but a few of them 327 in the united states there have been some successes as well as failures <\s>
<s> in january 1872 a number of machinists and other working men organized in the town of beaver falls pennsylvania a co operative foundry association for the manufacture of stoves hollow ware and fine castings <\s>
<s> on a small capital of only 4,000 they have steadily prospered paid the market rate of wages and also paid annual dividends over and above all expenses and interest on the plant of from twelve to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> in 1867 thirty workmen started a co operative foundry in somerset massachusetts with a capital of about 14,000 <\s>
<s> in the years 1874 1875 the company spent 5,400 for new flasks and patterns and yet showed a net gain of 11,914 <\s>
<s> in 1876 it had a capital of 30,000 and a surplus fund of 28,924 328   6 <\s>
<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>
<s> the gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to saving habits and greater regularity of work <\s>
<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>
<s> briggs at their collieries in yorkshire england 330 the relations between the owners and the laborers were as bad as they could well be <\s>
<s> xix that the average production of each operative constantly increased from 4,321 yards per year in 1830 to 28,032 yards in 1884 and this it was which made possible the corresponding increase in the rate of wages from 164 in 1830 to 290 in 1884 <\s>
<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>
<s> what must be the ultimate outlook for wages receivers <\s>
<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>
<s> if then the gain arising from improvements is largely passed to the credit of land owners as mr <\s>
<s> cairnes believes it should be absolutely necessary to spread among the working classes the doctrine that if they own their own homes and buy the land they live on to that extent will they    grow rich while they sleep    independently of their other exertions <\s>
<s> land worth 500 to day when bought by the savings of a laborer besides the self respect 315 it gives him will increase in value with the density of population and become worth 600 or more without other sacrifice of his <\s>
<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>

<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>
<s> what must be the ultimate outlook for wages receivers <\s>
<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>
<s> if then the gain arising from improvements is largely passed to the credit of land owners as mr <\s>
<s> cairnes believes it should be absolutely necessary to spread among the working classes the doctrine that if they own their own homes and buy the land they live on to that extent will they    grow rich while they sleep    independently of their other exertions <\s>
<s> land worth 500 to day when bought by the savings of a laborer besides the self respect 315 it gives him will increase in value with the density of population and become worth 600 or more without other sacrifice of his <\s>
<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>

<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>

<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>
<s> the gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to saving habits and greater regularity of work <\s>
<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>

<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>
<s> briggs at their collieries in yorkshire england 330 the relations between the owners and the laborers were as bad as they could well be <\s>

<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>

<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>
<s> number of members 90,000 525,000 capital share 428,000 5,881 000 capital loan 55,000 1,267 000 sales 2,333 000 20,901 000 net profit 165,000 1,617 000 several persons each subscribe a sum to make up the share capital of a store and a person is selected to take charge of the purchase and care of the goods <\s>
<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>

<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>

<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>

<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>

<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>

<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>

<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>

<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>

<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>

<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>

<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>

<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>

<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>
<s> number of members 90,000 525,000 capital share 428,000 5,881 000 capital loan 55,000 1,267 000 sales 2,333 000 20,901 000 net profit 165,000 1,617 000 several persons each subscribe a sum to make up the share capital of a store and a person is selected to take charge of the purchase and care of the goods <\s>
<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>
<s> beginning with a share capital of 250,000 and a loan capital of a like amount it set 80,000 spindles in operation <\s>
<s> in 1874 they had a share capital of 375,000 all subscribed except 1,000 and an equal amount of loan capital while the whole plant was estimated as worth 615,000 <\s>
<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>
<s> the last annual report of the co operative congress 1882 shows the existence in england and scotland of productive associations for the manufacture of cloth flannel fustian hosiery quilts worsted nails watches linen and silk as well as those for engineering printing and quarrying and these were but a few of them 327 in the united states there have been some successes as well as failures <\s>
<s> in january 1872 a number of machinists and other working men organized in the town of beaver falls pennsylvania a co operative foundry association for the manufacture of stoves hollow ware and fine castings <\s>
<s> on a small capital of only 4,000 they have steadily prospered paid the market rate of wages and also paid annual dividends over and above all expenses and interest on the plant of from twelve to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> in 1867 thirty workmen started a co operative foundry in somerset massachusetts with a capital of about 14,000 <\s>
<s> in the years 1874 1875 the company spent 5,400 for new flasks and patterns and yet showed a net gain of 11,914 <\s>
<s> in 1876 it had a capital of 30,000 and a surplus fund of 28,924 328   6 <\s>
<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>
<s> the gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to saving habits and greater regularity of work <\s>
<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>
<s> briggs at their collieries in yorkshire england 330 the relations between the owners and the laborers were as bad as they could well be <\s>
<s> xix that the average production of each operative constantly increased from 4,321 yards per year in 1830 to 28,032 yards in 1884 and this it was which made possible the corresponding increase in the rate of wages from 164 in 1830 to 290 in 1884 <\s>
<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>
<s> what must be the ultimate outlook for wages receivers <\s>
<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>
<s> if then the gain arising from improvements is largely passed to the credit of land owners as mr <\s>
<s> cairnes believes it should be absolutely necessary to spread among the working classes the doctrine that if they own their own homes and buy the land they live on to that extent will they    grow rich while they sleep    independently of their other exertions <\s>
<s> land worth 500 to day when bought by the savings of a laborer besides the self respect 315 it gives him will increase in value with the density of population and become worth 600 or more without other sacrifice of his <\s>
<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>

<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>

<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>
<s> if then the gain arising from improvements is largely passed to the credit of land owners as mr <\s>
<s> cairnes believes it should be absolutely necessary to spread among the working classes the doctrine that if they own their own homes and buy the land they live on to that extent will they    grow rich while they sleep    independently of their other exertions <\s>
<s> land worth 500 to day when bought by the savings of a laborer besides the self respect 315 it gives him will increase in value with the density of population and become worth 600 or more without other sacrifice of his <\s>
<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>

<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>

<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>

<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>

<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>
<s> the gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to saving habits and greater regularity of work <\s>
<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>

<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>

<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>

<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>
<s> number of members 90,000 525,000 capital share 428,000 5,881 000 capital loan 55,000 1,267 000 sales 2,333 000 20,901 000 net profit 165,000 1,617 000 several persons each subscribe a sum to make up the share capital of a store and a person is selected to take charge of the purchase and care of the goods <\s>
<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>

<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>
<s> beginning with a share capital of 250,000 and a loan capital of a like amount it set 80,000 spindles in operation <\s>
<s> in 1874 they had a share capital of 375,000 all subscribed except 1,000 and an equal amount of loan capital while the whole plant was estimated as worth 615,000 <\s>
<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>
<s> the last annual report of the co operative congress 1882 shows the existence in england and scotland of productive associations for the manufacture of cloth flannel fustian hosiery quilts worsted nails watches linen and silk as well as those for engineering printing and quarrying and these were but a few of them 327 in the united states there have been some successes as well as failures <\s>
<s> in january 1872 a number of machinists and other working men organized in the town of beaver falls pennsylvania a co operative foundry association for the manufacture of stoves hollow ware and fine castings <\s>
<s> on a small capital of only 4,000 they have steadily prospered paid the market rate of wages and also paid annual dividends over and above all expenses and interest on the plant of from twelve to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> in 1867 thirty workmen started a co operative foundry in somerset massachusetts with a capital of about 14,000 <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>
<s> the gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to saving habits and greater regularity of work <\s>
<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>
<s> briggs at their collieries in yorkshire england 330 the relations between the owners and the laborers were as bad as they could well be <\s>
<s> xix that the average production of each operative constantly increased from 4,321 yards per year in 1830 to 28,032 yards in 1884 and this it was which made possible the corresponding increase in the rate of wages from 164 in 1830 to 290 in 1884 <\s>
<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>
<s> what must be the ultimate outlook for wages receivers <\s>
<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>

<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>

<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>

<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>

<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>
<s> beginning with a share capital of 250,000 and a loan capital of a like amount it set 80,000 spindles in operation <\s>
<s> in 1874 they had a share capital of 375,000 all subscribed except 1,000 and an equal amount of loan capital while the whole plant was estimated as worth 615,000 <\s>
<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>
<s> the last annual report of the co operative congress 1882 shows the existence in england and scotland of productive associations for the manufacture of cloth flannel fustian hosiery quilts worsted nails watches linen and silk as well as those for engineering printing and quarrying and these were but a few of them 327 in the united states there have been some successes as well as failures <\s>
<s> in january 1872 a number of machinists and other working men organized in the town of beaver falls pennsylvania a co operative foundry association for the manufacture of stoves hollow ware and fine castings <\s>
<s> on a small capital of only 4,000 they have steadily prospered paid the market rate of wages and also paid annual dividends over and above all expenses and interest on the plant of from twelve to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> in 1867 thirty workmen started a co operative foundry in somerset massachusetts with a capital of about 14,000 <\s>
<s> in the years 1874 1875 the company spent 5,400 for new flasks and patterns and yet showed a net gain of 11,914 <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>
<s> the gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to saving habits and greater regularity of work <\s>
<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>
<s> briggs at their collieries in yorkshire england 330 the relations between the owners and the laborers were as bad as they could well be <\s>
<s> xix that the average production of each operative constantly increased from 4,321 yards per year in 1830 to 28,032 yards in 1884 and this it was which made possible the corresponding increase in the rate of wages from 164 in 1830 to 290 in 1884 <\s>
<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>
<s> what must be the ultimate outlook for wages receivers <\s>
<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>
<s> if then the gain arising from improvements is largely passed to the credit of land owners as mr <\s>
<s> cairnes believes it should be absolutely necessary to spread among the working classes the doctrine that if they own their own homes and buy the land they live on to that extent will they    grow rich while they sleep    independently of their other exertions <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>

<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>

<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>
<s> beginning with a share capital of 250,000 and a loan capital of a like amount it set 80,000 spindles in operation <\s>
<s> in 1874 they had a share capital of 375,000 all subscribed except 1,000 and an equal amount of loan capital while the whole plant was estimated as worth 615,000 <\s>
<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>
<s> the last annual report of the co operative congress 1882 shows the existence in england and scotland of productive associations for the manufacture of cloth flannel fustian hosiery quilts worsted nails watches linen and silk as well as those for engineering printing and quarrying and these were but a few of them 327 in the united states there have been some successes as well as failures <\s>
<s> in january 1872 a number of machinists and other working men organized in the town of beaver falls pennsylvania a co operative foundry association for the manufacture of stoves hollow ware and fine castings <\s>
<s> on a small capital of only 4,000 they have steadily prospered paid the market rate of wages and also paid annual dividends over and above all expenses and interest on the plant of from twelve to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> in 1867 thirty workmen started a co operative foundry in somerset massachusetts with a capital of about 14,000 <\s>
<s> in the years 1874 1875 the company spent 5,400 for new flasks and patterns and yet showed a net gain of 11,914 <\s>
<s> in 1876 it had a capital of 30,000 and a surplus fund of 28,924 328   6 <\s>
<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>
<s> the gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to saving habits and greater regularity of work <\s>
<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>
<s> briggs at their collieries in yorkshire england 330 the relations between the owners and the laborers were as bad as they could well be <\s>
<s> xix that the average production of each operative constantly increased from 4,321 yards per year in 1830 to 28,032 yards in 1884 and this it was which made possible the corresponding increase in the rate of wages from 164 in 1830 to 290 in 1884 <\s>
<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>
<s> what must be the ultimate outlook for wages receivers <\s>
<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>
<s> if then the gain arising from improvements is largely passed to the credit of land owners as mr <\s>
<s> cairnes believes it should be absolutely necessary to spread among the working classes the doctrine that if they own their own homes and buy the land they live on to that extent will they    grow rich while they sleep    independently of their other exertions <\s>
<s> land worth 500 to day when bought by the savings of a laborer besides the self respect 315 it gives him will increase in value with the density of population and become worth 600 or more without other sacrifice of his <\s>
<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>

<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>

<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>

<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>
<s> the gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to saving habits and greater regularity of work <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>

<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>

<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>

<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>
<s> number of members 90,000 525,000 capital share 428,000 5,881 000 capital loan 55,000 1,267 000 sales 2,333 000 20,901 000 net profit 165,000 1,617 000 several persons each subscribe a sum to make up the share capital of a store and a person is selected to take charge of the purchase and care of the goods <\s>
<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>

<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>

<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>

<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>

<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>

<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>

<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>

<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>

<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>

<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>

<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>

<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>

<s> in 1874 they had a share capital of 375,000 all subscribed except 1,000 and an equal amount of loan capital while the whole plant was estimated as worth 615,000 <\s>
<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>
<s> the last annual report of the co operative congress 1882 shows the existence in england and scotland of productive associations for the manufacture of cloth flannel fustian hosiery quilts worsted nails watches linen and silk as well as those for engineering printing and quarrying and these were but a few of them 327 in the united states there have been some successes as well as failures <\s>
<s> in january 1872 a number of machinists and other working men organized in the town of beaver falls pennsylvania a co operative foundry association for the manufacture of stoves hollow ware and fine castings <\s>
<s> on a small capital of only 4,000 they have steadily prospered paid the market rate of wages and also paid annual dividends over and above all expenses and interest on the plant of from twelve to fifteen per cent <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>
<s> the gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to saving habits and greater regularity of work <\s>
<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>
<s> briggs at their collieries in yorkshire england 330 the relations between the owners and the laborers were as bad as they could well be <\s>
<s> xix that the average production of each operative constantly increased from 4,321 yards per year in 1830 to 28,032 yards in 1884 and this it was which made possible the corresponding increase in the rate of wages from 164 in 1830 to 290 in 1884 <\s>
<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>

<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>

<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>
<s> briggs at their collieries in yorkshire england 330 the relations between the owners and the laborers were as bad as they could well be <\s>
<s> xix that the average production of each operative constantly increased from 4,321 yards per year in 1830 to 28,032 yards in 1884 and this it was which made possible the corresponding increase in the rate of wages from 164 in 1830 to 290 in 1884 <\s>
<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>
<s> what must be the ultimate outlook for wages receivers <\s>
<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>
<s> if then the gain arising from improvements is largely passed to the credit of land owners as mr <\s>
<s> cairnes believes it should be absolutely necessary to spread among the working classes the doctrine that if they own their own homes and buy the land they live on to that extent will they    grow rich while they sleep    independently of their other exertions <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>
<s> number of members 90,000 525,000 capital share 428,000 5,881 000 capital loan 55,000 1,267 000 sales 2,333 000 20,901 000 net profit 165,000 1,617 000 several persons each subscribe a sum to make up the share capital of a store and a person is selected to take charge of the purchase and care of the goods <\s>
<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>

<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>

<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>

<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>
<s> number of members 90,000 525,000 capital share 428,000 5,881 000 capital loan 55,000 1,267 000 sales 2,333 000 20,901 000 net profit 165,000 1,617 000 several persons each subscribe a sum to make up the share capital of a store and a person is selected to take charge of the purchase and care of the goods <\s>
<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>

<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>

<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>

<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>
<s> what must be the ultimate outlook for wages receivers <\s>
<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>

<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>

<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>

<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>

<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>
<s> beginning with a share capital of 250,000 and a loan capital of a like amount it set 80,000 spindles in operation <\s>
<s> in 1874 they had a share capital of 375,000 all subscribed except 1,000 and an equal amount of loan capital while the whole plant was estimated as worth 615,000 <\s>
<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>
<s> the last annual report of the co operative congress 1882 shows the existence in england and scotland of productive associations for the manufacture of cloth flannel fustian hosiery quilts worsted nails watches linen and silk as well as those for engineering printing and quarrying and these were but a few of them 327 in the united states there have been some successes as well as failures <\s>
<s> in january 1872 a number of machinists and other working men organized in the town of beaver falls pennsylvania a co operative foundry association for the manufacture of stoves hollow ware and fine castings <\s>
<s> on a small capital of only 4,000 they have steadily prospered paid the market rate of wages and also paid annual dividends over and above all expenses and interest on the plant of from twelve to fifteen per cent <\s>

<s> in 1876 it had a capital of 30,000 and a surplus fund of 28,924 328   6 <\s>
<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>
<s> the gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to saving habits and greater regularity of work <\s>
<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>
<s> briggs at their collieries in yorkshire england 330 the relations between the owners and the laborers were as bad as they could well be <\s>
<s> xix that the average production of each operative constantly increased from 4,321 yards per year in 1830 to 28,032 yards in 1884 and this it was which made possible the corresponding increase in the rate of wages from 164 in 1830 to 290 in 1884 <\s>
<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>
<s> what must be the ultimate outlook for wages receivers <\s>
<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>
<s> if then the gain arising from improvements is largely passed to the credit of land owners as mr <\s>
<s> cairnes believes it should be absolutely necessary to spread among the working classes the doctrine that if they own their own homes and buy the land they live on to that extent will they    grow rich while they sleep    independently of their other exertions <\s>
<s> land worth 500 to day when bought by the savings of a laborer besides the self respect 315 it gives him will increase in value with the density of population and become worth 600 or more without other sacrifice of his <\s>
<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>

<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>

<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>

<s> in 1874 they had a share capital of 375,000 all subscribed except 1,000 and an equal amount of loan capital while the whole plant was estimated as worth 615,000 <\s>
<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>
<s> the last annual report of the co operative congress 1882 shows the existence in england and scotland of productive associations for the manufacture of cloth flannel fustian hosiery quilts worsted nails watches linen and silk as well as those for engineering printing and quarrying and these were but a few of them 327 in the united states there have been some successes as well as failures <\s>
<s> in january 1872 a number of machinists and other working men organized in the town of beaver falls pennsylvania a co operative foundry association for the manufacture of stoves hollow ware and fine castings <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>
<s> the gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to saving habits and greater regularity of work <\s>
<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>
<s> briggs at their collieries in yorkshire england 330 the relations between the owners and the laborers were as bad as they could well be <\s>
<s> xix that the average production of each operative constantly increased from 4,321 yards per year in 1830 to 28,032 yards in 1884 and this it was which made possible the corresponding increase in the rate of wages from 164 in 1830 to 290 in 1884 <\s>
<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>
<s> the gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to saving habits and greater regularity of work <\s>
<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>
<s> briggs at their collieries in yorkshire england 330 the relations between the owners and the laborers were as bad as they could well be <\s>
<s> xix that the average production of each operative constantly increased from 4,321 yards per year in 1830 to 28,032 yards in 1884 and this it was which made possible the corresponding increase in the rate of wages from 164 in 1830 to 290 in 1884 <\s>
<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>
<s> what must be the ultimate outlook for wages receivers <\s>
<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>
<s> if then the gain arising from improvements is largely passed to the credit of land owners as mr <\s>
<s> cairnes believes it should be absolutely necessary to spread among the working classes the doctrine that if they own their own homes and buy the land they live on to that extent will they    grow rich while they sleep    independently of their other exertions <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>
<s> number of members 90,000 525,000 capital share 428,000 5,881 000 capital loan 55,000 1,267 000 sales 2,333 000 20,901 000 net profit 165,000 1,617 000 several persons each subscribe a sum to make up the share capital of a store and a person is selected to take charge of the purchase and care of the goods <\s>
<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>
<s> beginning with a share capital of 250,000 and a loan capital of a like amount it set 80,000 spindles in operation <\s>
<s> in 1874 they had a share capital of 375,000 all subscribed except 1,000 and an equal amount of loan capital while the whole plant was estimated as worth 615,000 <\s>
<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>

<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>

<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>

<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>

<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>
<s> number of members 90,000 525,000 capital share 428,000 5,881 000 capital loan 55,000 1,267 000 sales 2,333 000 20,901 000 net profit 165,000 1,617 000 several persons each subscribe a sum to make up the share capital of a store and a person is selected to take charge of the purchase and care of the goods <\s>
<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>

<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>

<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>

<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>

<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>

<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>

<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>

<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>

<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>
<s> number of members 90,000 525,000 capital share 428,000 5,881 000 capital loan 55,000 1,267 000 sales 2,333 000 20,901 000 net profit 165,000 1,617 000 several persons each subscribe a sum to make up the share capital of a store and a person is selected to take charge of the purchase and care of the goods <\s>
<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>
<s> beginning with a share capital of 250,000 and a loan capital of a like amount it set 80,000 spindles in operation <\s>
<s> in 1874 they had a share capital of 375,000 all subscribed except 1,000 and an equal amount of loan capital while the whole plant was estimated as worth 615,000 <\s>
<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>
<s> the last annual report of the co operative congress 1882 shows the existence in england and scotland of productive associations for the manufacture of cloth flannel fustian hosiery quilts worsted nails watches linen and silk as well as those for engineering printing and quarrying and these were but a few of them 327 in the united states there have been some successes as well as failures <\s>
<s> in january 1872 a number of machinists and other working men organized in the town of beaver falls pennsylvania a co operative foundry association for the manufacture of stoves hollow ware and fine castings <\s>
<s> on a small capital of only 4,000 they have steadily prospered paid the market rate of wages and also paid annual dividends over and above all expenses and interest on the plant of from twelve to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> in 1867 thirty workmen started a co operative foundry in somerset massachusetts with a capital of about 14,000 <\s>
<s> in the years 1874 1875 the company spent 5,400 for new flasks and patterns and yet showed a net gain of 11,914 <\s>
<s> in 1876 it had a capital of 30,000 and a surplus fund of 28,924 328   6 <\s>
<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>
<s> the gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to saving habits and greater regularity of work <\s>
<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>
<s> briggs at their collieries in yorkshire england 330 the relations between the owners and the laborers were as bad as they could well be <\s>
<s> xix that the average production of each operative constantly increased from 4,321 yards per year in 1830 to 28,032 yards in 1884 and this it was which made possible the corresponding increase in the rate of wages from 164 in 1830 to 290 in 1884 <\s>
<s> the sum of 290 a year as an average for each operative is a stipend too small to cause any general satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that 290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 <\s>
<s> there is then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years the condition of the working classes in the united states has been materially improved <\s>
<s> the diminishing proportion of the price which goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital 313 the same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous chapter 314 where the wages have been increased but the hours have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840 <\s>
<s>   2    through small holdings by which the landlords gain is shared <\s>
<s> so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists from laborers is maintained <\s>
<s> but this does not take into account that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as population <\s>
<s> what must be the ultimate outlook for wages receivers <\s>
<s> or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are wages receivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the product seems desirable <\s>
<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>
<s> if then the gain arising from improvements is largely passed to the credit of land owners as mr <\s>
<s> cairnes believes it should be absolutely necessary to spread among the working classes the doctrine that if they own their own homes and buy the land they live on to that extent will they    grow rich while they sleep    independently of their other exertions <\s>
<s> land worth 500 to day when bought by the savings of a laborer besides the self respect 315 it gives him will increase in value with the density of population and become worth 600 or more without other sacrifice of his <\s>
<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>

<s> how can they escape the thralldom of dependence on the accumulations of others <\s>
<s> in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase which goes to owners of land <\s>
<s> it has been seen that owners of the soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial progress <\s>
<s> if one large owner gains why should not the increment be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one <\s>
<s> the more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising from rent will be shared by a larger number <\s>
<s> this in my opinion is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in every country <\s>
<s> the greater the extension of small properties among the working class the more will they gain a share of that part of the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent increase of population <\s>
<s> if then the gain arising from improvements is largely passed to the credit of land owners as mr <\s>
<s> cairnes believes it should be absolutely necessary to spread among the working classes the doctrine that if they own their own homes and buy the land they live on to that extent will they    grow rich while they sleep    independently of their other exertions <\s>
<s> land worth 500 to day when bought by the savings of a laborer besides the self respect 315 it gives him will increase in value with the density of population and become worth 600 or more without other sacrifice of his <\s>
<s>    through co operation by which the managers wages are shared <\s>
<s> it will be found however that of the various industrial rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by    profits    only the interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of capital but that the managers wages wages of superintendence are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully manage large business interests <\s>
<s> to the laborer this large payment to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital <\s>
<s> this we now know to be wrong <\s>
<s> the managers wages are payments of exactly the same nature as any laborers wages <\s>
<s> it makes no difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor <\s>
<s> the payment to capital purely as such known as interest with insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet we see men gain by industrial operations enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely managers wages <\s>
<s> for in many instances as hitherto discussed we have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he employs <\s>
<s> to what does this lead us <\s>
<s> inevitably to the conclusion that the laborer if he would become something more than a receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command managers wages <\s>
<s> the importance of this principle to the working man can not be exaggerated and there flows from it important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower classes <\s>
<s> it leads us directly to the means by which the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher positionthe actual details of which of course are difficult but as they are not included in political economy they must be left to sociologyand forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of productive co operation <\s>
<s> in short co operation owes its existence to the possibility of dividing the managers wages to a greater or less degree among the so called wages receivers or the    laboring class    and it is from this point of view that co operation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way <\s>
<s> for it is to be said that in some of its forms co operation gives the most promising economic results as regards the condition of the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion upon the relations of labor and capital <\s>
<s> it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which the co operative principle has manifested itself <\s>
<s> these may be said in general to be four 1 distributive co operation by which goods already produced are bought and sold to members without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive co operation by which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing goods for the market 3 partial productive co operation in the form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers without dispensing with the latter and 4 co operative or peoples banks <\s>
<s> there are of course many other forms in which the principle of co operation has been applied but these four are probably the most characteristic <\s>
<s> distributive co operation is at once the simplest and the most successful form not merely because it requires less for capital than any other for its inception but also because it calls for less business and executive capacity <\s>
<s> the number of persons capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties involved in the care of wholesale housesor at all events of mills and factories <\s>
<s> distributive co operation has its origin in the fact that the expenses of a middle man between the producer and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that more capital had collected in the business of distribution than could economically be so employed <\s>
<s> its educating power on the men concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial management is of no little importance <\s>
<s> it is therefore the best gateway to any further or more difficult co operative experimentssuch experiments as can be attempted only after the proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is discovered or developed by training <\s>
<s> in england co operation began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to such a stimulus of self help in the laborer that now co operative gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions <\s>
<s> under the system which separates employers and the employed high wages are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish for it is sometimes found that the best paid workmen are the most unwise and intemperate 316 for the most ignorant and unskilled of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility of improvement <\s>
<s> self help must be stimulated not deadened by stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state <\s>
<s> the extraordinary growth of co operation is one of the most cheering signs of modern times <\s>
<s> distributive co operation originated in rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions <\s>
<s> by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices <\s>
<s> they were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they divided proportionally to the capital subscribed <\s>
<s> others soon joined them they took a store room and in 1882 there were 10,894 members with a share capital of 1,576 215 and with realized profits in that year of 162,885 <\s>
<s> they have erected expensive steam flour mills and the society occupies eighteen branch establishments in rochdale <\s>
<s> libraries containing more than 15,000 volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts attended by 500 students have been maintained <\s>
<s> the extension of the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale establishment of their own <\s>
<s> it is now a large institution with branches in london and newcastle <\s>
<s>    it owns manufactories in london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter potatoes and eggs <\s>
<s> it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and it owns two steamships <\s>
<s> it has a banking department with a turn over of more than   12,000 000 annually    317 the following figures for england and wales tell their own story as to the progress of co operation :( 318 1862 <\s>
<s> number of members 90,000 525,000 capital share 428,000 5,881 000 capital loan 55,000 1,267 000 sales 2,333 000 20,901 000 net profit 165,000 1,617 000 several persons each subscribe a sum to make up the share capital of a store and a person is selected to take charge of the purchase and care of the goods <\s>
<s> the advantages of the plan are 1 a division among the co operators of all the net profits of the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is no inducement to make gains by adulterations <\s>
<s> it is often found that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does not amount to one per cent on the returns <\s>
<s> the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority which has been recommended by mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 319 is as follows of funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends on the subscribed capital of the members ;( 320 5 of such a sum as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the residue and that only among all the persons employed and members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages or of their respective purchases during the quarter 321 the payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to be considered an essential element of success <\s>
<s> productive co operation presents many serious difficulties the chief of which is the need of managing ability <\s>
<s> some one in the association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to buy he must know the processes of the special production thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready to change his products accordinglyin short a man eminently fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the profitable management of one belonging to a body of co operators <\s>
<s> it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to managers wages and it is very often only his skill prudence and experience that make the difference between a failure and a success in business <\s>
<s> unless co operators are willing to pay as large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will make their venture succeed 322 in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in 1848 were a failure <\s>
<s> nowhere has it been more clearly seen that state help has been disastrous than in france where the constituent assembly voted 3,000 000 francs for co operative experiments all of which failed <\s>
<s> curiously enough distributive co operation has not succeeded in france because owing to a wide spread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing less than productive schemes <\s>
<s> and their success in this has been no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a task beyond its powers 323 in great britain and the united states there have been some successful experiments in production and mr <\s>
<s> holyoake 324 holds that although workmen certainly do begrudge the managers salary productive associations are possible when managed by a board of elected directors <\s>
<s> he urges moreover that as in distributive co operation if profits are shared with customers there will be insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and commissions <\s>
<s> the plan of actual operations upon which successes have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save capital chiefly through co operative associations 2 to purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases of customers <\s>
<s> those mills and factories which have sprung out of the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem and naturally so to have been most successful <\s>
<s> they have gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their customers were beforehand secured <\s>
<s> that is where the difficulties of the managers function have been lessened they have a better chance of success <\s>
<s> and yet it must be said that productive associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor when working for its own interest and this is an important consideration to be urged in favor of such associations <\s>
<s> the sun mill 325 at oldham england was established for spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some co operative bodies <\s>
<s> beginning with a share capital of 250,000 and a loan capital of a like amount it set 80,000 spindles in operation <\s>
<s> in 1874 they had a share capital of 375,000 all subscribed except 1,000 and an equal amount of loan capital while the whole plant was estimated as worth 615,000 <\s>
<s> two and a half per cent per annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in the first ten years a total sum of 160,000 was set aside for depreciation of the property <\s>
<s> the profits have varied from two to forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital <\s>
<s> during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized a profit of 12  per cent although it is known that the cotton trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression <\s>
<s> many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes when they are successful as in the case of the hatters    association in newark new jersey 326 the workmen have no desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a corporation by themselves <\s>
<s> the mere fact that they do sometimes succeed is an important thing <\s>
<s> then too they have an opportunity of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community which exists separate from the possession of capital <\s>
<s> and in these days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily although he often is a large owner of capital <\s>
<s> the last annual report of the co operative congress 1882 shows the existence in england and scotland of productive associations for the manufacture of cloth flannel fustian hosiery quilts worsted nails watches linen and silk as well as those for engineering printing and quarrying and these were but a few of them 327 in the united states there have been some successes as well as failures <\s>
<s> in january 1872 a number of machinists and other working men organized in the town of beaver falls pennsylvania a co operative foundry association for the manufacture of stoves hollow ware and fine castings <\s>
<s> on a small capital of only 4,000 they have steadily prospered paid the market rate of wages and also paid annual dividends over and above all expenses and interest on the plant of from twelve to fifteen per cent <\s>
<s> in 1867 thirty workmen started a co operative foundry in somerset massachusetts with a capital of about 14,000 <\s>
<s> in the years 1874 1875 the company spent 5,400 for new flasks and patterns and yet showed a net gain of 11,914 <\s>
<s> in 1876 it had a capital of 30,000 and a surplus fund of 28,924 328   6 <\s>
<s> the difficulties of productive co operation arising from the need of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial partnership by which the manager retains the control of the business operations but shares his profits with the workmen <\s>
<s> the gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to saving habits and greater regularity of work <\s>
<s> this system is particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not themselves rise to the demands of productive co operation <\s>
<s> the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways <\s>
<s>    ninety five kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but how to remedy the evil was the problem <\s>
<s> a bonus of 3 d on every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninety five to the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling bonus worked the miracle <\s>
<s> the work was done equally well or better with forty eight kilogrammes of coke instead of ninety five just one half or nearly saved by careful work at an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving    329 the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has been that of the messrs <\s>

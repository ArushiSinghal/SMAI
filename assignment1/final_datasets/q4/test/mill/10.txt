<s> moreover suppose that lands down to grade three paid rent when a took the farm now if the price of produce rises slightly grade four may pay something but possibly not enough to warrant any rent going to a landlord <\s>
<s> a will put capital on it for this return but certainly not until the price warrants it that is not until the price will return him at least the cost of working the land plus the profit on his outlay <\s>
<s> but the community needed this land or the price would not have gone up to the point which makes possible its cultivation even for a profit without rent <\s>
<s> there must always be somewhere some land affected in just this way <\s>
<s>    or to the capital employed in the least advantageous circumstances <\s>
<s> let us however suppose that there were a validity in this objection which can by no means be conceded to it that when the demand of the community had forced up food to such a price as would remunerate the expense of producing it from a certain quality of soil it happened nevertheless that all the soil of that quality was withheld from cultivation the increase of produce which the wants of society required would for the time be obtained wholly as it always is partially not by an extension of cultivation but by an increased application of labor and capital to land already cultivated <\s>
<s> now we have already seen that this increased application of capital other things being unaltered is always attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> the rise of price enables measures to be taken for increasing the produce which could not have been taken with profit at the previous price <\s>
<s> the farmer uses more expensive manures or manures land which he formerly left to nature or procures lime or marl from a distance as a dressing for the soil or pulverizes or weeds it more thoroughly or drains irrigates or subsoils portions of it which at former prices would not have paid the cost of the operation and so forth <\s>
<s> the farmer or improver will only consider whether the outlay he makes for the purpose will be returned to him with the ordinary profit and not whether any surplus will remain for rent <\s>
<s> even therefore if it were the fact that there is never any land taken into cultivation for which rent and that too of an amount worth taking into consideration was not paid it would be true nevertheless that there is always some agricultural capital which pays no rent because it returns nothing beyond the ordinary rate of profit this capital being the portion of capital last appliedthat to which the last addition to the produce was due or to express the essentials of the case in one phrase that which is applied in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> but the same amount of demand and the same price which enable this least productive portion of capital barely to replace itself with the ordinary profit enable every other portion to yield a surplus proportioned to the advantage it possesses <\s>
<s> and this surplus it is which competition enables the landlord to appropriate <\s>
<s> if land were all occupied and of only one grade the first installment of labor and capital produced we will say twenty bushels of wheat when the price of wheat rose and it became profitable to resort to greater expense on the soil a second installment of the same amount of labor and capital when applied however only yielded fifteen bushels more a third ten bushels more and a fourth five bushels more <\s>
<s> the soil now gives fifty bushels only under the highest pressure <\s>
<s> but if it was profitable to invest the same installment of labor and capital simply for the five bushels that at first had received a return of twenty bushels the price must have gone up so that five bushels should sell for as much as the twenty did formerly so mutatis mutandis of installments second and third <\s>
<s> so that if the demand is such as to require all of the fifty bushels the agricultural capital which produced the five bushels will be the standard according to which the rent of the capital which grew twenty fifteen and ten bushels respectively is measured <\s>
<s> the principle is exactly the same as if equal installments of capital and labor were invested on four different grades of land returning twenty fifteen ten and five bushels for each installment <\s>
<s> or as if in the table on page 240 a b c and d each represented different installments of the same amount of labor and capital put upon the same spot of ground instead of being as there put upon different grades of land <\s>
<s> the rent of all land is measured by the excess of the return to the whole capital employed on it above what is necessary to replace the capital with the ordinary rate of profit or in other words above what the same capital would yield if it were all employed in as disadvantageous circumstances as the least productive portion of it whether that least productive portion of capital is rendered so by being employed on the worst soil or by being expended in extorting more produce from land which already yielded as much as it could be made to part with on easier terms <\s>
<s> it will be true that the farmer requires the ordinary rate of profit on the whole of his capital that whatever it returns to him beyond this he is obliged to pay to the landlord but will not consent to pay more that there is a portion of capital applied to agriculture in such circumstances of productiveness as to yield only the ordinary profits and that the difference between the produce of this and of any other capital of similar amount is the measure of the tribute which that other capital can and will pay under the name of rent to the landlord <\s>
<s> this constitutes a law of rent as near the truth as such a law can possibly be though of course modified or disturbed in individual cases by pending contracts individual miscalculations the influence of habit and even the particular feelings and dispositions of the persons concerned <\s>
<s> the law of rent in the economic sense operates in the united states as truly as elsewhere although there is no separate class of landlords here <\s>
<s> with us almost all land is owned by the cultivator so that two functions those of the landlord and farmer are both united in one person <\s>
<s> although one payment is made it is still just as distinctly made up of two parts one of which is a payment to the owner for the superior quality of his soil and the other a payment to the same person if the owner is the cultivator of profit on the farmers working capital <\s>
<s> land which in the united states will only return enough to pay a profit on this capital can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> and land which can pay more than a profit on this working capital returns that excess as rent even if the farmer is also the owner and landlord <\s>
<s> the principle which regulates the amount of that excesswhich is the essential pointis the principle which determines the amount of economic rent and it holds true in the united states or finland provided only that different grades of land are called into cultivation <\s>
<s> the governing principle is the same no matter whether a payment is made to one man as profit and to another as rent or whether the two payments are made to the same man in two capacities <\s>
<s> it has been urged that the law of rent does not hold in the united states because    the price of grain and other agricultural produce has not risen in proportion to the increase of our numbers as it ought to have done if ricardos theory were true but has fallen since 1830 though since that time our population has been more than tripled    181 this overlooks the fact that we have not even yet taken up all our best agricultural lands so that for some products the law of diminishing productiveness has not yet shown itself <\s>
<s> the reason is that the extension of our railway system has only of late years brought the really good grain lands into cultivation <\s>
<s> the fact that there has been no rise in agricultural products is due to the enormous extent of marvelously fertile grain lands in the west and to the cheapness of transportation from those districts to the seaboard <\s>
<s> for a general understanding of the law of rent the following table will show how under constant increase of population represented by four different advances of population in the first column first the best and then the poorer lands are brought into cultivation <\s>

<s> opposing views of the law of rent <\s>
<s> under the name of rent many payments are commonly included which are not a remuneration for the original powers of the land itself but for capital expended on it <\s>
<s> the buildings are as distinct a thing from the farm as the stock or the timber on it and what is paid for them can no more be called rent of land than a payment for cattle would be if it were the custom that the landlord should stock the farm for the tenant <\s>
<s> the buildings like the cattle are not land but capital regularly consumed and reproduced and all payments made in consideration for them are properly interest <\s>
<s> but with regard to capital actually sunk in improvements and not requiring periodical renewal but spent once for all in giving the land a permanent increase of productiveness it appears to me that the return made to such capital loses altogether the character of profits and is governed by the principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is true that a landlord will not expend capital in improving his estate unless he expects from the improvement an increase of income surpassing the interest of his outlay <\s>
<s> prospectively this increase of income may be regarded as profit but when the expense has been incurred and the improvement made the rent of the improved land is governed by the same rules as that of the unimproved <\s>
<s> carey as well as bastiat has declared that there is a law of increasing returns from land <\s>
<s> he points out that everything now existing could be reproduced to day at a less cost than that involved in its original production owing to our advance in skill knowledge and all the arts of production that for example it costs less to make an axe now than it did five hundred years ago so also with a farm since a farm of a given amount of productiveness can be brought into cultivation at less cost to day than that originally spent upon it <\s>
<s> the gain of society has we all admit been such that we produce almost everything at a less cost now than long ago but to class a farm and an axe together overlooks in the most remarkable way the fact that land can not be created by labor and capital while axes can and that too indefinitely <\s>
<s> nor can the produce from the land be increased indefinitely at a diminishing cost <\s>
<s> this is sometimes denied by the appeal to facts    it can be abundantly proved that if we take any two periods sufficiently distant to afford a fair test whether fifty or one hundred or five hundred years the production of the land relatively to the labor employed upon it has progressively become greater and greater    182 but this does not prove that an existing tendency to diminishing returns has not been more than offset by the progress of the arts and improvements <\s>
<s>    the advance of a ship against wind and tide is no proof that there is no wind and tide    in a work entitled    the past the present and the future    mr <\s>
<s> carey takes a ground of objection to the ricardo theory of rent namely that in point of historical fact the lands first brought under cultivation are not the most fertile but the barren lands <\s>
<s>    we find the settler invariably occupying the high and thin lands requiring little clearing and no drainage <\s>
<s> with the growth of population and wealth other soils yielding a larger return to labor are always brought into activity with a constantly increasing return to the labor expended upon them    in whatever order the lands come into cultivation those which when cultivated yield the least return in proportion to the labor required for their culture will always regulate the price of agricultural produce and all other lands will pay a rent simply equivalent to the excess of their produce over this minimum <\s>
<s> whatever unguarded expressions may have been occasionally used in describing the law of rent these two propositions are all that was ever intended by it <\s>
<s> carey could show that the return to labor from the land agricultural skill and science being supposed the same is not a diminishing return he would overthrow a principle much more fundamental than any law of rent <\s>
<s> but in this he has wholly failed <\s>
<s> another objection taken against the law of diminishing returns and so against the law of rent is that the potential increase of food e g of a grain of wheat is far greater than that of man 183 no one disputes the fact that one grain of wheat can reproduce itself more times than man and that too in a geometric increase but not without land <\s>
<s> a grain of wheat needs land in which it can multiply itself and this necessary element of its increase is limited and it is the very thing which limits the multiplication of the grains of wheat <\s>
<s> on the same piece of land one can not get more than what comes from one act of reproduction in the grain <\s>
<s> if one grain produces 100 of its kind doubling the capital will not repeatedly cause a geometric increase in the ratio of reproduction of each grain on this same land so that one grain by one process produces of its kind 200 400 800 or 1,600 because you can not multiply the land in any such ratio as would accompany this potential reduplication of the grain <\s>
<s> this objection would not seem worth answering were it not that it furnishes some difficulty to really honest inquirers <\s>
<s> others again allege as an objection against ricardo that if all land were of equal fertility it might still yield a rent <\s>
<s> but ricardo says precisely the same <\s>
<s> it is also distinctly a portion of ricardos doctrine that even apart from differences of situation the land of a country supposed to be of uniform fertility would all of it on a certain supposition pay rent namely if the demand of the community required that it should all be cultivated and cultivated beyond the point at which a further application of capital begins to be attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> this is simply the question before discussed whether if only one class of land were cultivated some agricultural capital would pay rent or not <\s>
<s> it all depends on the fact whether populationand so the demand for foodhas increased to the point where it calls out a recognition of the diminishing productiveness of the soil <\s>
<s> in that case different capitals would be invested so that there would be different returns to the same amount of capital and the prior or more advantageous investments of capital on the land would yield more than the ordinary rate of profit which could be claimed as rent <\s>
<s> perry 184 admits the law of diminishing returns but holds that    as land is capital and as every form of capital may be loaned or rented and thus become fruitful in the hands of another the rent of land does not differ essentially in its nature from the rent of buildings in cities or from the interest of money    henry george admits ricardos law of rent to its full extent but very curiously says    irrespective of the increase of population the effect of improvements in methods of production and exchange is to increase rent .... <\s>
<s> the effect of labor saving improvements will be to increase the production of wealth <\s>
<s> now for the production of wealth two things are required labor and land <\s>
<s> therefore the effect of labor saving improvements will be to extend the demand for land and wherever the limit of the quality of land in use is reached to bring into cultivation lands of less natural productiveness or to extend cultivation on the same lands to a point of lower natural productiveness <\s>
<s> and thus while the primary effect of labor saving improvements is to increase the power of labor the secondary effect is to extend cultivation and where this lowers the margin of cultivation to increase rent    185 francis bowen 186 rejects ricardos law and says    rent depends not on the increase but on the distribution of the populationasserting that the existence of large cities and towns determines the amount of rent paid by neighboring land 187   6 <\s>
<s> rent does not enter into the cost of production of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent does not really form any part of the expenses of agricultural production or of the advances of the capitalist <\s>
<s> the grounds on which this assertion was made are now apparent <\s>
<s> it is true that all tenant farmers and many other classes of producers pay rent <\s>
<s> but we have now seen that whoever cultivates land paying a rent for it gets in return for his rent an instrument of superior power to other instruments of the same kind for which no rent is paid <\s>
<s> the superiority of the instrument is in exact proportion to the rent paid for it <\s>
<s> if a few persons had steam engines of superior power to all others in existence but limited by physical laws to a number short of the demand the rent which a manufacturer would be willing to pay for one of these steam engines could not be looked upon as an addition to his outlay because by the use of it he would save in his other expenses the equivalent of what it cost him without it he could not do the same quantity of work unless at an additional expense equal to the rent <\s>
<s> the same thing is true of land <\s>
<s> the real expenses of production are those incurred on the worst land or by the capital employed in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> this land or capital pays as we have seen no rent but the expenses to which it is subject cause all other land or agricultural capital to be subjected to an equivalent expense in the form of rent <\s>
<s> whoever does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantages and the rent which he pays does not place him in a worse position than but only in the same position as his fellow producer who pays no rent but whose instrument is one of inferior efficiency <\s>
<s> soils are of every grade some which if cultivated might replace the capital but give no profit some give a slight but not an ordinary profit some the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> that is    there is a point up to which it is profitable to cultivate and beyond which it is not profitable to cultivate <\s>
<s> the price of corn will not for any long time remain at a higher rate than is sufficient to cover with ordinary profit the cost of that portion of the general crop which is raised at greatest expense    188 for similar reasons the price will not remain at a lower rate <\s>
<s> if then the cost of production of grain is determined by that land which replaces the capital yields only the ordinary profit and pays no rent rent forms no part of this cost since that land does not and can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> mcleod 189 however says it is not the cost of production which regulates the value of agricultural produce but the value which regulates the cost <\s>
<s> definitions of value in use exchange value and price <\s>
<s> it is evident that of the two great departments of political economy the production of wealth and its distribution the consideration of value has to do with the latter alone and with that only so far as competition and not usage or custom is the distributing agency <\s>
<s> the use of a thing in political economy means its capacity to satisfy a desire or serve a purpose <\s>
<s> diamonds have this capacity in a high degree and unless they had it would not bear any price <\s>
<s> value in use or as mr <\s>
<s> de quincey calls it teleologic value is the extreme limit of value in exchange <\s>
<s> the exchange value of a thing may fall short to any amount of its value in use but that it can ever exceed the value in use implies a contradiction it supposes that persons will give to possess a thing more than the utmost value which they themselves put upon it as a means of gratifying their inclinations <\s>
<s> the word value when used without adjunct always means in political economy value in exchange <\s>
<s> exchange value requires to be distinguished from price <\s>
<s> writers have employed price to express the value of a thing in relation to moneythe quantity of money for which it will exchange <\s>
<s> moreover suppose that lands down to grade three paid rent when a took the farm now if the price of produce rises slightly grade four may pay something but possibly not enough to warrant any rent going to a landlord <\s>
<s> a will put capital on it for this return but certainly not until the price warrants it that is not until the price will return him at least the cost of working the land plus the profit on his outlay <\s>

<s> and thus while the primary effect of labor saving improvements is to increase the power of labor the secondary effect is to extend cultivation and where this lowers the margin of cultivation to increase rent    185 francis bowen 186 rejects ricardos law and says    rent depends not on the increase but on the distribution of the populationasserting that the existence of large cities and towns determines the amount of rent paid by neighboring land 187   6 <\s>
<s> rent does not enter into the cost of production of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent does not really form any part of the expenses of agricultural production or of the advances of the capitalist <\s>
<s> the grounds on which this assertion was made are now apparent <\s>
<s> it is true that all tenant farmers and many other classes of producers pay rent <\s>
<s> but we have now seen that whoever cultivates land paying a rent for it gets in return for his rent an instrument of superior power to other instruments of the same kind for which no rent is paid <\s>
<s> the superiority of the instrument is in exact proportion to the rent paid for it <\s>
<s> if a few persons had steam engines of superior power to all others in existence but limited by physical laws to a number short of the demand the rent which a manufacturer would be willing to pay for one of these steam engines could not be looked upon as an addition to his outlay because by the use of it he would save in his other expenses the equivalent of what it cost him without it he could not do the same quantity of work unless at an additional expense equal to the rent <\s>
<s> the same thing is true of land <\s>
<s> the real expenses of production are those incurred on the worst land or by the capital employed in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> this land or capital pays as we have seen no rent but the expenses to which it is subject cause all other land or agricultural capital to be subjected to an equivalent expense in the form of rent <\s>
<s> whoever does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantages and the rent which he pays does not place him in a worse position than but only in the same position as his fellow producer who pays no rent but whose instrument is one of inferior efficiency <\s>
<s> soils are of every grade some which if cultivated might replace the capital but give no profit some give a slight but not an ordinary profit some the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> that is    there is a point up to which it is profitable to cultivate and beyond which it is not profitable to cultivate <\s>
<s> the price of corn will not for any long time remain at a higher rate than is sufficient to cover with ordinary profit the cost of that portion of the general crop which is raised at greatest expense    188 for similar reasons the price will not remain at a lower rate <\s>
<s> if then the cost of production of grain is determined by that land which replaces the capital yields only the ordinary profit and pays no rent rent forms no part of this cost since that land does not and can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> mcleod 189 however says it is not the cost of production which regulates the value of agricultural produce but the value which regulates the cost <\s>
<s> definitions of value in use exchange value and price <\s>
<s> it is evident that of the two great departments of political economy the production of wealth and its distribution the consideration of value has to do with the latter alone and with that only so far as competition and not usage or custom is the distributing agency <\s>
<s> the use of a thing in political economy means its capacity to satisfy a desire or serve a purpose <\s>
<s> diamonds have this capacity in a high degree and unless they had it would not bear any price <\s>
<s> value in use or as mr <\s>
<s> de quincey calls it teleologic value is the extreme limit of value in exchange <\s>
<s> the exchange value of a thing may fall short to any amount of its value in use but that it can ever exceed the value in use implies a contradiction it supposes that persons will give to possess a thing more than the utmost value which they themselves put upon it as a means of gratifying their inclinations <\s>
<s> the word value when used without adjunct always means in political economy value in exchange <\s>
<s> exchange value requires to be distinguished from price <\s>
<s> writers have employed price to express the value of a thing in relation to moneythe quantity of money for which it will exchange <\s>
<s> moreover suppose that lands down to grade three paid rent when a took the farm now if the price of produce rises slightly grade four may pay something but possibly not enough to warrant any rent going to a landlord <\s>
<s> a will put capital on it for this return but certainly not until the price warrants it that is not until the price will return him at least the cost of working the land plus the profit on his outlay <\s>
<s> but the community needed this land or the price would not have gone up to the point which makes possible its cultivation even for a profit without rent <\s>
<s> there must always be somewhere some land affected in just this way <\s>
<s>    or to the capital employed in the least advantageous circumstances <\s>
<s> let us however suppose that there were a validity in this objection which can by no means be conceded to it that when the demand of the community had forced up food to such a price as would remunerate the expense of producing it from a certain quality of soil it happened nevertheless that all the soil of that quality was withheld from cultivation the increase of produce which the wants of society required would for the time be obtained wholly as it always is partially not by an extension of cultivation but by an increased application of labor and capital to land already cultivated <\s>
<s> now we have already seen that this increased application of capital other things being unaltered is always attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> the rise of price enables measures to be taken for increasing the produce which could not have been taken with profit at the previous price <\s>
<s> the farmer uses more expensive manures or manures land which he formerly left to nature or procures lime or marl from a distance as a dressing for the soil or pulverizes or weeds it more thoroughly or drains irrigates or subsoils portions of it which at former prices would not have paid the cost of the operation and so forth <\s>
<s> the farmer or improver will only consider whether the outlay he makes for the purpose will be returned to him with the ordinary profit and not whether any surplus will remain for rent <\s>
<s> even therefore if it were the fact that there is never any land taken into cultivation for which rent and that too of an amount worth taking into consideration was not paid it would be true nevertheless that there is always some agricultural capital which pays no rent because it returns nothing beyond the ordinary rate of profit this capital being the portion of capital last appliedthat to which the last addition to the produce was due or to express the essentials of the case in one phrase that which is applied in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> but the same amount of demand and the same price which enable this least productive portion of capital barely to replace itself with the ordinary profit enable every other portion to yield a surplus proportioned to the advantage it possesses <\s>
<s> and this surplus it is which competition enables the landlord to appropriate <\s>
<s> if land were all occupied and of only one grade the first installment of labor and capital produced we will say twenty bushels of wheat when the price of wheat rose and it became profitable to resort to greater expense on the soil a second installment of the same amount of labor and capital when applied however only yielded fifteen bushels more a third ten bushels more and a fourth five bushels more <\s>
<s> the soil now gives fifty bushels only under the highest pressure <\s>
<s> but if it was profitable to invest the same installment of labor and capital simply for the five bushels that at first had received a return of twenty bushels the price must have gone up so that five bushels should sell for as much as the twenty did formerly so mutatis mutandis of installments second and third <\s>
<s> so that if the demand is such as to require all of the fifty bushels the agricultural capital which produced the five bushels will be the standard according to which the rent of the capital which grew twenty fifteen and ten bushels respectively is measured <\s>
<s> the principle is exactly the same as if equal installments of capital and labor were invested on four different grades of land returning twenty fifteen ten and five bushels for each installment <\s>
<s> or as if in the table on page 240 a b c and d each represented different installments of the same amount of labor and capital put upon the same spot of ground instead of being as there put upon different grades of land <\s>
<s> the rent of all land is measured by the excess of the return to the whole capital employed on it above what is necessary to replace the capital with the ordinary rate of profit or in other words above what the same capital would yield if it were all employed in as disadvantageous circumstances as the least productive portion of it whether that least productive portion of capital is rendered so by being employed on the worst soil or by being expended in extorting more produce from land which already yielded as much as it could be made to part with on easier terms <\s>
<s> it will be true that the farmer requires the ordinary rate of profit on the whole of his capital that whatever it returns to him beyond this he is obliged to pay to the landlord but will not consent to pay more that there is a portion of capital applied to agriculture in such circumstances of productiveness as to yield only the ordinary profits and that the difference between the produce of this and of any other capital of similar amount is the measure of the tribute which that other capital can and will pay under the name of rent to the landlord <\s>
<s> this constitutes a law of rent as near the truth as such a law can possibly be though of course modified or disturbed in individual cases by pending contracts individual miscalculations the influence of habit and even the particular feelings and dispositions of the persons concerned <\s>
<s> the law of rent in the economic sense operates in the united states as truly as elsewhere although there is no separate class of landlords here <\s>
<s> with us almost all land is owned by the cultivator so that two functions those of the landlord and farmer are both united in one person <\s>
<s> although one payment is made it is still just as distinctly made up of two parts one of which is a payment to the owner for the superior quality of his soil and the other a payment to the same person if the owner is the cultivator of profit on the farmers working capital <\s>
<s> land which in the united states will only return enough to pay a profit on this capital can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> and land which can pay more than a profit on this working capital returns that excess as rent even if the farmer is also the owner and landlord <\s>
<s> the principle which regulates the amount of that excesswhich is the essential pointis the principle which determines the amount of economic rent and it holds true in the united states or finland provided only that different grades of land are called into cultivation <\s>
<s> the governing principle is the same no matter whether a payment is made to one man as profit and to another as rent or whether the two payments are made to the same man in two capacities <\s>
<s> it has been urged that the law of rent does not hold in the united states because    the price of grain and other agricultural produce has not risen in proportion to the increase of our numbers as it ought to have done if ricardos theory were true but has fallen since 1830 though since that time our population has been more than tripled    181 this overlooks the fact that we have not even yet taken up all our best agricultural lands so that for some products the law of diminishing productiveness has not yet shown itself <\s>
<s> the reason is that the extension of our railway system has only of late years brought the really good grain lands into cultivation <\s>
<s> the fact that there has been no rise in agricultural products is due to the enormous extent of marvelously fertile grain lands in the west and to the cheapness of transportation from those districts to the seaboard <\s>
<s> for a general understanding of the law of rent the following table will show how under constant increase of population represented by four different advances of population in the first column first the best and then the poorer lands are brought into cultivation <\s>
<s> we will suppose 1 that the most fertile land a at first pays no rent then 2 when more food is wanted than land a can supply it will be profitable to till land b but which as yet pays no rent <\s>

<s> opposing views of the law of rent <\s>
<s> under the name of rent many payments are commonly included which are not a remuneration for the original powers of the land itself but for capital expended on it <\s>
<s> the buildings are as distinct a thing from the farm as the stock or the timber on it and what is paid for them can no more be called rent of land than a payment for cattle would be if it were the custom that the landlord should stock the farm for the tenant <\s>
<s> the buildings like the cattle are not land but capital regularly consumed and reproduced and all payments made in consideration for them are properly interest <\s>
<s> but with regard to capital actually sunk in improvements and not requiring periodical renewal but spent once for all in giving the land a permanent increase of productiveness it appears to me that the return made to such capital loses altogether the character of profits and is governed by the principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is true that a landlord will not expend capital in improving his estate unless he expects from the improvement an increase of income surpassing the interest of his outlay <\s>
<s> prospectively this increase of income may be regarded as profit but when the expense has been incurred and the improvement made the rent of the improved land is governed by the same rules as that of the unimproved <\s>
<s> carey as well as bastiat has declared that there is a law of increasing returns from land <\s>
<s> he points out that everything now existing could be reproduced to day at a less cost than that involved in its original production owing to our advance in skill knowledge and all the arts of production that for example it costs less to make an axe now than it did five hundred years ago so also with a farm since a farm of a given amount of productiveness can be brought into cultivation at less cost to day than that originally spent upon it <\s>
<s> the gain of society has we all admit been such that we produce almost everything at a less cost now than long ago but to class a farm and an axe together overlooks in the most remarkable way the fact that land can not be created by labor and capital while axes can and that too indefinitely <\s>
<s> nor can the produce from the land be increased indefinitely at a diminishing cost <\s>
<s> this is sometimes denied by the appeal to facts    it can be abundantly proved that if we take any two periods sufficiently distant to afford a fair test whether fifty or one hundred or five hundred years the production of the land relatively to the labor employed upon it has progressively become greater and greater    182 but this does not prove that an existing tendency to diminishing returns has not been more than offset by the progress of the arts and improvements <\s>
<s>    the advance of a ship against wind and tide is no proof that there is no wind and tide    in a work entitled    the past the present and the future    mr <\s>
<s> carey takes a ground of objection to the ricardo theory of rent namely that in point of historical fact the lands first brought under cultivation are not the most fertile but the barren lands <\s>
<s>    we find the settler invariably occupying the high and thin lands requiring little clearing and no drainage <\s>
<s> with the growth of population and wealth other soils yielding a larger return to labor are always brought into activity with a constantly increasing return to the labor expended upon them    in whatever order the lands come into cultivation those which when cultivated yield the least return in proportion to the labor required for their culture will always regulate the price of agricultural produce and all other lands will pay a rent simply equivalent to the excess of their produce over this minimum <\s>
<s> whatever unguarded expressions may have been occasionally used in describing the law of rent these two propositions are all that was ever intended by it <\s>
<s> carey could show that the return to labor from the land agricultural skill and science being supposed the same is not a diminishing return he would overthrow a principle much more fundamental than any law of rent <\s>
<s> but in this he has wholly failed <\s>
<s> another objection taken against the law of diminishing returns and so against the law of rent is that the potential increase of food e g of a grain of wheat is far greater than that of man 183 no one disputes the fact that one grain of wheat can reproduce itself more times than man and that too in a geometric increase but not without land <\s>
<s> a grain of wheat needs land in which it can multiply itself and this necessary element of its increase is limited and it is the very thing which limits the multiplication of the grains of wheat <\s>
<s> on the same piece of land one can not get more than what comes from one act of reproduction in the grain <\s>
<s> if one grain produces 100 of its kind doubling the capital will not repeatedly cause a geometric increase in the ratio of reproduction of each grain on this same land so that one grain by one process produces of its kind 200 400 800 or 1,600 because you can not multiply the land in any such ratio as would accompany this potential reduplication of the grain <\s>
<s> this objection would not seem worth answering were it not that it furnishes some difficulty to really honest inquirers <\s>
<s> others again allege as an objection against ricardo that if all land were of equal fertility it might still yield a rent <\s>
<s> but ricardo says precisely the same <\s>
<s> it is also distinctly a portion of ricardos doctrine that even apart from differences of situation the land of a country supposed to be of uniform fertility would all of it on a certain supposition pay rent namely if the demand of the community required that it should all be cultivated and cultivated beyond the point at which a further application of capital begins to be attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> this is simply the question before discussed whether if only one class of land were cultivated some agricultural capital would pay rent or not <\s>
<s> it all depends on the fact whether populationand so the demand for foodhas increased to the point where it calls out a recognition of the diminishing productiveness of the soil <\s>
<s> in that case different capitals would be invested so that there would be different returns to the same amount of capital and the prior or more advantageous investments of capital on the land would yield more than the ordinary rate of profit which could be claimed as rent <\s>
<s> perry 184 admits the law of diminishing returns but holds that    as land is capital and as every form of capital may be loaned or rented and thus become fruitful in the hands of another the rent of land does not differ essentially in its nature from the rent of buildings in cities or from the interest of money    henry george admits ricardos law of rent to its full extent but very curiously says    irrespective of the increase of population the effect of improvements in methods of production and exchange is to increase rent .... <\s>
<s> the effect of labor saving improvements will be to increase the production of wealth <\s>
<s> now for the production of wealth two things are required labor and land <\s>

<s> with the growth of population and wealth other soils yielding a larger return to labor are always brought into activity with a constantly increasing return to the labor expended upon them    in whatever order the lands come into cultivation those which when cultivated yield the least return in proportion to the labor required for their culture will always regulate the price of agricultural produce and all other lands will pay a rent simply equivalent to the excess of their produce over this minimum <\s>

<s> another objection taken against the law of diminishing returns and so against the law of rent is that the potential increase of food e g of a grain of wheat is far greater than that of man 183 no one disputes the fact that one grain of wheat can reproduce itself more times than man and that too in a geometric increase but not without land <\s>
<s> a grain of wheat needs land in which it can multiply itself and this necessary element of its increase is limited and it is the very thing which limits the multiplication of the grains of wheat <\s>
<s> on the same piece of land one can not get more than what comes from one act of reproduction in the grain <\s>
<s> if one grain produces 100 of its kind doubling the capital will not repeatedly cause a geometric increase in the ratio of reproduction of each grain on this same land so that one grain by one process produces of its kind 200 400 800 or 1,600 because you can not multiply the land in any such ratio as would accompany this potential reduplication of the grain <\s>
<s> this objection would not seem worth answering were it not that it furnishes some difficulty to really honest inquirers <\s>
<s> others again allege as an objection against ricardo that if all land were of equal fertility it might still yield a rent <\s>
<s> but ricardo says precisely the same <\s>
<s> it is also distinctly a portion of ricardos doctrine that even apart from differences of situation the land of a country supposed to be of uniform fertility would all of it on a certain supposition pay rent namely if the demand of the community required that it should all be cultivated and cultivated beyond the point at which a further application of capital begins to be attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> this is simply the question before discussed whether if only one class of land were cultivated some agricultural capital would pay rent or not <\s>
<s> it all depends on the fact whether populationand so the demand for foodhas increased to the point where it calls out a recognition of the diminishing productiveness of the soil <\s>
<s> in that case different capitals would be invested so that there would be different returns to the same amount of capital and the prior or more advantageous investments of capital on the land would yield more than the ordinary rate of profit which could be claimed as rent <\s>
<s> perry 184 admits the law of diminishing returns but holds that    as land is capital and as every form of capital may be loaned or rented and thus become fruitful in the hands of another the rent of land does not differ essentially in its nature from the rent of buildings in cities or from the interest of money    henry george admits ricardos law of rent to its full extent but very curiously says    irrespective of the increase of population the effect of improvements in methods of production and exchange is to increase rent .... <\s>
<s> the effect of labor saving improvements will be to increase the production of wealth <\s>
<s> now for the production of wealth two things are required labor and land <\s>
<s> therefore the effect of labor saving improvements will be to extend the demand for land and wherever the limit of the quality of land in use is reached to bring into cultivation lands of less natural productiveness or to extend cultivation on the same lands to a point of lower natural productiveness <\s>
<s> and thus while the primary effect of labor saving improvements is to increase the power of labor the secondary effect is to extend cultivation and where this lowers the margin of cultivation to increase rent    185 francis bowen 186 rejects ricardos law and says    rent depends not on the increase but on the distribution of the populationasserting that the existence of large cities and towns determines the amount of rent paid by neighboring land 187   6 <\s>
<s> rent does not enter into the cost of production of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent does not really form any part of the expenses of agricultural production or of the advances of the capitalist <\s>
<s> the grounds on which this assertion was made are now apparent <\s>
<s> it is true that all tenant farmers and many other classes of producers pay rent <\s>
<s> but we have now seen that whoever cultivates land paying a rent for it gets in return for his rent an instrument of superior power to other instruments of the same kind for which no rent is paid <\s>
<s> the superiority of the instrument is in exact proportion to the rent paid for it <\s>
<s> if a few persons had steam engines of superior power to all others in existence but limited by physical laws to a number short of the demand the rent which a manufacturer would be willing to pay for one of these steam engines could not be looked upon as an addition to his outlay because by the use of it he would save in his other expenses the equivalent of what it cost him without it he could not do the same quantity of work unless at an additional expense equal to the rent <\s>
<s> the same thing is true of land <\s>
<s> the real expenses of production are those incurred on the worst land or by the capital employed in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> this land or capital pays as we have seen no rent but the expenses to which it is subject cause all other land or agricultural capital to be subjected to an equivalent expense in the form of rent <\s>
<s> whoever does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantages and the rent which he pays does not place him in a worse position than but only in the same position as his fellow producer who pays no rent but whose instrument is one of inferior efficiency <\s>
<s> soils are of every grade some which if cultivated might replace the capital but give no profit some give a slight but not an ordinary profit some the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> that is    there is a point up to which it is profitable to cultivate and beyond which it is not profitable to cultivate <\s>
<s> the price of corn will not for any long time remain at a higher rate than is sufficient to cover with ordinary profit the cost of that portion of the general crop which is raised at greatest expense    188 for similar reasons the price will not remain at a lower rate <\s>
<s> if then the cost of production of grain is determined by that land which replaces the capital yields only the ordinary profit and pays no rent rent forms no part of this cost since that land does not and can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> mcleod 189 however says it is not the cost of production which regulates the value of agricultural produce but the value which regulates the cost <\s>
<s> definitions of value in use exchange value and price <\s>
<s> it is evident that of the two great departments of political economy the production of wealth and its distribution the consideration of value has to do with the latter alone and with that only so far as competition and not usage or custom is the distributing agency <\s>
<s> the use of a thing in political economy means its capacity to satisfy a desire or serve a purpose <\s>
<s> diamonds have this capacity in a high degree and unless they had it would not bear any price <\s>
<s> value in use or as mr <\s>
<s> de quincey calls it teleologic value is the extreme limit of value in exchange <\s>
<s> the exchange value of a thing may fall short to any amount of its value in use but that it can ever exceed the value in use implies a contradiction it supposes that persons will give to possess a thing more than the utmost value which they themselves put upon it as a means of gratifying their inclinations <\s>
<s> the word value when used without adjunct always means in political economy value in exchange <\s>
<s> exchange value requires to be distinguished from price <\s>
<s> writers have employed price to express the value of a thing in relation to moneythe quantity of money for which it will exchange <\s>
<s> moreover suppose that lands down to grade three paid rent when a took the farm now if the price of produce rises slightly grade four may pay something but possibly not enough to warrant any rent going to a landlord <\s>
<s> a will put capital on it for this return but certainly not until the price warrants it that is not until the price will return him at least the cost of working the land plus the profit on his outlay <\s>
<s> but the community needed this land or the price would not have gone up to the point which makes possible its cultivation even for a profit without rent <\s>
<s> there must always be somewhere some land affected in just this way <\s>
<s>    or to the capital employed in the least advantageous circumstances <\s>
<s> let us however suppose that there were a validity in this objection which can by no means be conceded to it that when the demand of the community had forced up food to such a price as would remunerate the expense of producing it from a certain quality of soil it happened nevertheless that all the soil of that quality was withheld from cultivation the increase of produce which the wants of society required would for the time be obtained wholly as it always is partially not by an extension of cultivation but by an increased application of labor and capital to land already cultivated <\s>
<s> now we have already seen that this increased application of capital other things being unaltered is always attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> the rise of price enables measures to be taken for increasing the produce which could not have been taken with profit at the previous price <\s>
<s> the farmer uses more expensive manures or manures land which he formerly left to nature or procures lime or marl from a distance as a dressing for the soil or pulverizes or weeds it more thoroughly or drains irrigates or subsoils portions of it which at former prices would not have paid the cost of the operation and so forth <\s>
<s> the farmer or improver will only consider whether the outlay he makes for the purpose will be returned to him with the ordinary profit and not whether any surplus will remain for rent <\s>
<s> even therefore if it were the fact that there is never any land taken into cultivation for which rent and that too of an amount worth taking into consideration was not paid it would be true nevertheless that there is always some agricultural capital which pays no rent because it returns nothing beyond the ordinary rate of profit this capital being the portion of capital last appliedthat to which the last addition to the produce was due or to express the essentials of the case in one phrase that which is applied in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> but the same amount of demand and the same price which enable this least productive portion of capital barely to replace itself with the ordinary profit enable every other portion to yield a surplus proportioned to the advantage it possesses <\s>
<s> and this surplus it is which competition enables the landlord to appropriate <\s>
<s> if land were all occupied and of only one grade the first installment of labor and capital produced we will say twenty bushels of wheat when the price of wheat rose and it became profitable to resort to greater expense on the soil a second installment of the same amount of labor and capital when applied however only yielded fifteen bushels more a third ten bushels more and a fourth five bushels more <\s>
<s> the soil now gives fifty bushels only under the highest pressure <\s>
<s> but if it was profitable to invest the same installment of labor and capital simply for the five bushels that at first had received a return of twenty bushels the price must have gone up so that five bushels should sell for as much as the twenty did formerly so mutatis mutandis of installments second and third <\s>
<s> so that if the demand is such as to require all of the fifty bushels the agricultural capital which produced the five bushels will be the standard according to which the rent of the capital which grew twenty fifteen and ten bushels respectively is measured <\s>
<s> the principle is exactly the same as if equal installments of capital and labor were invested on four different grades of land returning twenty fifteen ten and five bushels for each installment <\s>
<s> or as if in the table on page 240 a b c and d each represented different installments of the same amount of labor and capital put upon the same spot of ground instead of being as there put upon different grades of land <\s>
<s> the rent of all land is measured by the excess of the return to the whole capital employed on it above what is necessary to replace the capital with the ordinary rate of profit or in other words above what the same capital would yield if it were all employed in as disadvantageous circumstances as the least productive portion of it whether that least productive portion of capital is rendered so by being employed on the worst soil or by being expended in extorting more produce from land which already yielded as much as it could be made to part with on easier terms <\s>
<s> it will be true that the farmer requires the ordinary rate of profit on the whole of his capital that whatever it returns to him beyond this he is obliged to pay to the landlord but will not consent to pay more that there is a portion of capital applied to agriculture in such circumstances of productiveness as to yield only the ordinary profits and that the difference between the produce of this and of any other capital of similar amount is the measure of the tribute which that other capital can and will pay under the name of rent to the landlord <\s>
<s> this constitutes a law of rent as near the truth as such a law can possibly be though of course modified or disturbed in individual cases by pending contracts individual miscalculations the influence of habit and even the particular feelings and dispositions of the persons concerned <\s>
<s> the law of rent in the economic sense operates in the united states as truly as elsewhere although there is no separate class of landlords here <\s>
<s> with us almost all land is owned by the cultivator so that two functions those of the landlord and farmer are both united in one person <\s>
<s> although one payment is made it is still just as distinctly made up of two parts one of which is a payment to the owner for the superior quality of his soil and the other a payment to the same person if the owner is the cultivator of profit on the farmers working capital <\s>
<s> land which in the united states will only return enough to pay a profit on this capital can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> and land which can pay more than a profit on this working capital returns that excess as rent even if the farmer is also the owner and landlord <\s>
<s> the principle which regulates the amount of that excesswhich is the essential pointis the principle which determines the amount of economic rent and it holds true in the united states or finland provided only that different grades of land are called into cultivation <\s>
<s> the governing principle is the same no matter whether a payment is made to one man as profit and to another as rent or whether the two payments are made to the same man in two capacities <\s>
<s> it has been urged that the law of rent does not hold in the united states because    the price of grain and other agricultural produce has not risen in proportion to the increase of our numbers as it ought to have done if ricardos theory were true but has fallen since 1830 though since that time our population has been more than tripled    181 this overlooks the fact that we have not even yet taken up all our best agricultural lands so that for some products the law of diminishing productiveness has not yet shown itself <\s>
<s> the reason is that the extension of our railway system has only of late years brought the really good grain lands into cultivation <\s>
<s> the fact that there has been no rise in agricultural products is due to the enormous extent of marvelously fertile grain lands in the west and to the cheapness of transportation from those districts to the seaboard <\s>
<s> for a general understanding of the law of rent the following table will show how under constant increase of population represented by four different advances of population in the first column first the best and then the poorer lands are brought into cultivation <\s>
<s> we will suppose 1 that the most fertile land a at first pays no rent then 2 when more food is wanted than land a can supply it will be profitable to till land b but which as yet pays no rent <\s>

<s> under the name of rent many payments are commonly included which are not a remuneration for the original powers of the land itself but for capital expended on it <\s>
<s> the buildings are as distinct a thing from the farm as the stock or the timber on it and what is paid for them can no more be called rent of land than a payment for cattle would be if it were the custom that the landlord should stock the farm for the tenant <\s>
<s> the buildings like the cattle are not land but capital regularly consumed and reproduced and all payments made in consideration for them are properly interest <\s>
<s> but with regard to capital actually sunk in improvements and not requiring periodical renewal but spent once for all in giving the land a permanent increase of productiveness it appears to me that the return made to such capital loses altogether the character of profits and is governed by the principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is true that a landlord will not expend capital in improving his estate unless he expects from the improvement an increase of income surpassing the interest of his outlay <\s>
<s> prospectively this increase of income may be regarded as profit but when the expense has been incurred and the improvement made the rent of the improved land is governed by the same rules as that of the unimproved <\s>
<s> carey as well as bastiat has declared that there is a law of increasing returns from land <\s>
<s> he points out that everything now existing could be reproduced to day at a less cost than that involved in its original production owing to our advance in skill knowledge and all the arts of production that for example it costs less to make an axe now than it did five hundred years ago so also with a farm since a farm of a given amount of productiveness can be brought into cultivation at less cost to day than that originally spent upon it <\s>
<s> the gain of society has we all admit been such that we produce almost everything at a less cost now than long ago but to class a farm and an axe together overlooks in the most remarkable way the fact that land can not be created by labor and capital while axes can and that too indefinitely <\s>
<s> nor can the produce from the land be increased indefinitely at a diminishing cost <\s>
<s> this is sometimes denied by the appeal to facts    it can be abundantly proved that if we take any two periods sufficiently distant to afford a fair test whether fifty or one hundred or five hundred years the production of the land relatively to the labor employed upon it has progressively become greater and greater    182 but this does not prove that an existing tendency to diminishing returns has not been more than offset by the progress of the arts and improvements <\s>

<s> it has been urged that the law of rent does not hold in the united states because    the price of grain and other agricultural produce has not risen in proportion to the increase of our numbers as it ought to have done if ricardos theory were true but has fallen since 1830 though since that time our population has been more than tripled    181 this overlooks the fact that we have not even yet taken up all our best agricultural lands so that for some products the law of diminishing productiveness has not yet shown itself <\s>
<s> the reason is that the extension of our railway system has only of late years brought the really good grain lands into cultivation <\s>
<s> the fact that there has been no rise in agricultural products is due to the enormous extent of marvelously fertile grain lands in the west and to the cheapness of transportation from those districts to the seaboard <\s>

<s> opposing views of the law of rent <\s>
<s> under the name of rent many payments are commonly included which are not a remuneration for the original powers of the land itself but for capital expended on it <\s>
<s> the buildings are as distinct a thing from the farm as the stock or the timber on it and what is paid for them can no more be called rent of land than a payment for cattle would be if it were the custom that the landlord should stock the farm for the tenant <\s>
<s> the buildings like the cattle are not land but capital regularly consumed and reproduced and all payments made in consideration for them are properly interest <\s>
<s> but with regard to capital actually sunk in improvements and not requiring periodical renewal but spent once for all in giving the land a permanent increase of productiveness it appears to me that the return made to such capital loses altogether the character of profits and is governed by the principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is true that a landlord will not expend capital in improving his estate unless he expects from the improvement an increase of income surpassing the interest of his outlay <\s>
<s> prospectively this increase of income may be regarded as profit but when the expense has been incurred and the improvement made the rent of the improved land is governed by the same rules as that of the unimproved <\s>
<s> carey as well as bastiat has declared that there is a law of increasing returns from land <\s>
<s> he points out that everything now existing could be reproduced to day at a less cost than that involved in its original production owing to our advance in skill knowledge and all the arts of production that for example it costs less to make an axe now than it did five hundred years ago so also with a farm since a farm of a given amount of productiveness can be brought into cultivation at less cost to day than that originally spent upon it <\s>
<s> the gain of society has we all admit been such that we produce almost everything at a less cost now than long ago but to class a farm and an axe together overlooks in the most remarkable way the fact that land can not be created by labor and capital while axes can and that too indefinitely <\s>
<s> nor can the produce from the land be increased indefinitely at a diminishing cost <\s>
<s> this is sometimes denied by the appeal to facts    it can be abundantly proved that if we take any two periods sufficiently distant to afford a fair test whether fifty or one hundred or five hundred years the production of the land relatively to the labor employed upon it has progressively become greater and greater    182 but this does not prove that an existing tendency to diminishing returns has not been more than offset by the progress of the arts and improvements <\s>
<s>    the advance of a ship against wind and tide is no proof that there is no wind and tide    in a work entitled    the past the present and the future    mr <\s>
<s> carey takes a ground of objection to the ricardo theory of rent namely that in point of historical fact the lands first brought under cultivation are not the most fertile but the barren lands <\s>
<s>    we find the settler invariably occupying the high and thin lands requiring little clearing and no drainage <\s>
<s> with the growth of population and wealth other soils yielding a larger return to labor are always brought into activity with a constantly increasing return to the labor expended upon them    in whatever order the lands come into cultivation those which when cultivated yield the least return in proportion to the labor required for their culture will always regulate the price of agricultural produce and all other lands will pay a rent simply equivalent to the excess of their produce over this minimum <\s>
<s> whatever unguarded expressions may have been occasionally used in describing the law of rent these two propositions are all that was ever intended by it <\s>
<s> carey could show that the return to labor from the land agricultural skill and science being supposed the same is not a diminishing return he would overthrow a principle much more fundamental than any law of rent <\s>
<s> but in this he has wholly failed <\s>
<s> another objection taken against the law of diminishing returns and so against the law of rent is that the potential increase of food e g of a grain of wheat is far greater than that of man 183 no one disputes the fact that one grain of wheat can reproduce itself more times than man and that too in a geometric increase but not without land <\s>
<s> a grain of wheat needs land in which it can multiply itself and this necessary element of its increase is limited and it is the very thing which limits the multiplication of the grains of wheat <\s>
<s> on the same piece of land one can not get more than what comes from one act of reproduction in the grain <\s>
<s> if one grain produces 100 of its kind doubling the capital will not repeatedly cause a geometric increase in the ratio of reproduction of each grain on this same land so that one grain by one process produces of its kind 200 400 800 or 1,600 because you can not multiply the land in any such ratio as would accompany this potential reduplication of the grain <\s>
<s> this objection would not seem worth answering were it not that it furnishes some difficulty to really honest inquirers <\s>
<s> others again allege as an objection against ricardo that if all land were of equal fertility it might still yield a rent <\s>
<s> but ricardo says precisely the same <\s>
<s> it is also distinctly a portion of ricardos doctrine that even apart from differences of situation the land of a country supposed to be of uniform fertility would all of it on a certain supposition pay rent namely if the demand of the community required that it should all be cultivated and cultivated beyond the point at which a further application of capital begins to be attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> this is simply the question before discussed whether if only one class of land were cultivated some agricultural capital would pay rent or not <\s>
<s> it all depends on the fact whether populationand so the demand for foodhas increased to the point where it calls out a recognition of the diminishing productiveness of the soil <\s>
<s> in that case different capitals would be invested so that there would be different returns to the same amount of capital and the prior or more advantageous investments of capital on the land would yield more than the ordinary rate of profit which could be claimed as rent <\s>
<s> perry 184 admits the law of diminishing returns but holds that    as land is capital and as every form of capital may be loaned or rented and thus become fruitful in the hands of another the rent of land does not differ essentially in its nature from the rent of buildings in cities or from the interest of money    henry george admits ricardos law of rent to its full extent but very curiously says    irrespective of the increase of population the effect of improvements in methods of production and exchange is to increase rent .... <\s>
<s> the effect of labor saving improvements will be to increase the production of wealth <\s>
<s> now for the production of wealth two things are required labor and land <\s>
<s> therefore the effect of labor saving improvements will be to extend the demand for land and wherever the limit of the quality of land in use is reached to bring into cultivation lands of less natural productiveness or to extend cultivation on the same lands to a point of lower natural productiveness <\s>
<s> and thus while the primary effect of labor saving improvements is to increase the power of labor the secondary effect is to extend cultivation and where this lowers the margin of cultivation to increase rent    185 francis bowen 186 rejects ricardos law and says    rent depends not on the increase but on the distribution of the populationasserting that the existence of large cities and towns determines the amount of rent paid by neighboring land 187   6 <\s>
<s> rent does not enter into the cost of production of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent does not really form any part of the expenses of agricultural production or of the advances of the capitalist <\s>
<s> the grounds on which this assertion was made are now apparent <\s>
<s> it is true that all tenant farmers and many other classes of producers pay rent <\s>
<s> but we have now seen that whoever cultivates land paying a rent for it gets in return for his rent an instrument of superior power to other instruments of the same kind for which no rent is paid <\s>
<s> the superiority of the instrument is in exact proportion to the rent paid for it <\s>
<s> if a few persons had steam engines of superior power to all others in existence but limited by physical laws to a number short of the demand the rent which a manufacturer would be willing to pay for one of these steam engines could not be looked upon as an addition to his outlay because by the use of it he would save in his other expenses the equivalent of what it cost him without it he could not do the same quantity of work unless at an additional expense equal to the rent <\s>
<s> the same thing is true of land <\s>
<s> the real expenses of production are those incurred on the worst land or by the capital employed in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> this land or capital pays as we have seen no rent but the expenses to which it is subject cause all other land or agricultural capital to be subjected to an equivalent expense in the form of rent <\s>
<s> whoever does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantages and the rent which he pays does not place him in a worse position than but only in the same position as his fellow producer who pays no rent but whose instrument is one of inferior efficiency <\s>
<s> soils are of every grade some which if cultivated might replace the capital but give no profit some give a slight but not an ordinary profit some the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> that is    there is a point up to which it is profitable to cultivate and beyond which it is not profitable to cultivate <\s>
<s> the price of corn will not for any long time remain at a higher rate than is sufficient to cover with ordinary profit the cost of that portion of the general crop which is raised at greatest expense    188 for similar reasons the price will not remain at a lower rate <\s>
<s> if then the cost of production of grain is determined by that land which replaces the capital yields only the ordinary profit and pays no rent rent forms no part of this cost since that land does not and can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> mcleod 189 however says it is not the cost of production which regulates the value of agricultural produce but the value which regulates the cost <\s>
<s> definitions of value in use exchange value and price <\s>
<s> it is evident that of the two great departments of political economy the production of wealth and its distribution the consideration of value has to do with the latter alone and with that only so far as competition and not usage or custom is the distributing agency <\s>
<s> the use of a thing in political economy means its capacity to satisfy a desire or serve a purpose <\s>
<s> diamonds have this capacity in a high degree and unless they had it would not bear any price <\s>
<s> value in use or as mr <\s>
<s> de quincey calls it teleologic value is the extreme limit of value in exchange <\s>
<s> the exchange value of a thing may fall short to any amount of its value in use but that it can ever exceed the value in use implies a contradiction it supposes that persons will give to possess a thing more than the utmost value which they themselves put upon it as a means of gratifying their inclinations <\s>
<s> the word value when used without adjunct always means in political economy value in exchange <\s>
<s> exchange value requires to be distinguished from price <\s>
<s> writers have employed price to express the value of a thing in relation to moneythe quantity of money for which it will exchange <\s>
<s> moreover suppose that lands down to grade three paid rent when a took the farm now if the price of produce rises slightly grade four may pay something but possibly not enough to warrant any rent going to a landlord <\s>
<s> a will put capital on it for this return but certainly not until the price warrants it that is not until the price will return him at least the cost of working the land plus the profit on his outlay <\s>
<s> but the community needed this land or the price would not have gone up to the point which makes possible its cultivation even for a profit without rent <\s>
<s> there must always be somewhere some land affected in just this way <\s>
<s>    or to the capital employed in the least advantageous circumstances <\s>
<s> let us however suppose that there were a validity in this objection which can by no means be conceded to it that when the demand of the community had forced up food to such a price as would remunerate the expense of producing it from a certain quality of soil it happened nevertheless that all the soil of that quality was withheld from cultivation the increase of produce which the wants of society required would for the time be obtained wholly as it always is partially not by an extension of cultivation but by an increased application of labor and capital to land already cultivated <\s>
<s> now we have already seen that this increased application of capital other things being unaltered is always attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> the rise of price enables measures to be taken for increasing the produce which could not have been taken with profit at the previous price <\s>
<s> the farmer uses more expensive manures or manures land which he formerly left to nature or procures lime or marl from a distance as a dressing for the soil or pulverizes or weeds it more thoroughly or drains irrigates or subsoils portions of it which at former prices would not have paid the cost of the operation and so forth <\s>
<s> the farmer or improver will only consider whether the outlay he makes for the purpose will be returned to him with the ordinary profit and not whether any surplus will remain for rent <\s>
<s> even therefore if it were the fact that there is never any land taken into cultivation for which rent and that too of an amount worth taking into consideration was not paid it would be true nevertheless that there is always some agricultural capital which pays no rent because it returns nothing beyond the ordinary rate of profit this capital being the portion of capital last appliedthat to which the last addition to the produce was due or to express the essentials of the case in one phrase that which is applied in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> but the same amount of demand and the same price which enable this least productive portion of capital barely to replace itself with the ordinary profit enable every other portion to yield a surplus proportioned to the advantage it possesses <\s>
<s> and this surplus it is which competition enables the landlord to appropriate <\s>
<s> if land were all occupied and of only one grade the first installment of labor and capital produced we will say twenty bushels of wheat when the price of wheat rose and it became profitable to resort to greater expense on the soil a second installment of the same amount of labor and capital when applied however only yielded fifteen bushels more a third ten bushels more and a fourth five bushels more <\s>
<s> the soil now gives fifty bushels only under the highest pressure <\s>
<s> but if it was profitable to invest the same installment of labor and capital simply for the five bushels that at first had received a return of twenty bushels the price must have gone up so that five bushels should sell for as much as the twenty did formerly so mutatis mutandis of installments second and third <\s>
<s> so that if the demand is such as to require all of the fifty bushels the agricultural capital which produced the five bushels will be the standard according to which the rent of the capital which grew twenty fifteen and ten bushels respectively is measured <\s>
<s> the principle is exactly the same as if equal installments of capital and labor were invested on four different grades of land returning twenty fifteen ten and five bushels for each installment <\s>
<s> or as if in the table on page 240 a b c and d each represented different installments of the same amount of labor and capital put upon the same spot of ground instead of being as there put upon different grades of land <\s>
<s> the rent of all land is measured by the excess of the return to the whole capital employed on it above what is necessary to replace the capital with the ordinary rate of profit or in other words above what the same capital would yield if it were all employed in as disadvantageous circumstances as the least productive portion of it whether that least productive portion of capital is rendered so by being employed on the worst soil or by being expended in extorting more produce from land which already yielded as much as it could be made to part with on easier terms <\s>
<s> it will be true that the farmer requires the ordinary rate of profit on the whole of his capital that whatever it returns to him beyond this he is obliged to pay to the landlord but will not consent to pay more that there is a portion of capital applied to agriculture in such circumstances of productiveness as to yield only the ordinary profits and that the difference between the produce of this and of any other capital of similar amount is the measure of the tribute which that other capital can and will pay under the name of rent to the landlord <\s>
<s> this constitutes a law of rent as near the truth as such a law can possibly be though of course modified or disturbed in individual cases by pending contracts individual miscalculations the influence of habit and even the particular feelings and dispositions of the persons concerned <\s>
<s> the law of rent in the economic sense operates in the united states as truly as elsewhere although there is no separate class of landlords here <\s>
<s> with us almost all land is owned by the cultivator so that two functions those of the landlord and farmer are both united in one person <\s>
<s> although one payment is made it is still just as distinctly made up of two parts one of which is a payment to the owner for the superior quality of his soil and the other a payment to the same person if the owner is the cultivator of profit on the farmers working capital <\s>
<s> land which in the united states will only return enough to pay a profit on this capital can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> and land which can pay more than a profit on this working capital returns that excess as rent even if the farmer is also the owner and landlord <\s>
<s> the principle which regulates the amount of that excesswhich is the essential pointis the principle which determines the amount of economic rent and it holds true in the united states or finland provided only that different grades of land are called into cultivation <\s>
<s> the governing principle is the same no matter whether a payment is made to one man as profit and to another as rent or whether the two payments are made to the same man in two capacities <\s>

<s> even therefore if it were the fact that there is never any land taken into cultivation for which rent and that too of an amount worth taking into consideration was not paid it would be true nevertheless that there is always some agricultural capital which pays no rent because it returns nothing beyond the ordinary rate of profit this capital being the portion of capital last appliedthat to which the last addition to the produce was due or to express the essentials of the case in one phrase that which is applied in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> but the same amount of demand and the same price which enable this least productive portion of capital barely to replace itself with the ordinary profit enable every other portion to yield a surplus proportioned to the advantage it possesses <\s>
<s> and this surplus it is which competition enables the landlord to appropriate <\s>
<s> if land were all occupied and of only one grade the first installment of labor and capital produced we will say twenty bushels of wheat when the price of wheat rose and it became profitable to resort to greater expense on the soil a second installment of the same amount of labor and capital when applied however only yielded fifteen bushels more a third ten bushels more and a fourth five bushels more <\s>
<s> the soil now gives fifty bushels only under the highest pressure <\s>
<s> but if it was profitable to invest the same installment of labor and capital simply for the five bushels that at first had received a return of twenty bushels the price must have gone up so that five bushels should sell for as much as the twenty did formerly so mutatis mutandis of installments second and third <\s>
<s> so that if the demand is such as to require all of the fifty bushels the agricultural capital which produced the five bushels will be the standard according to which the rent of the capital which grew twenty fifteen and ten bushels respectively is measured <\s>
<s> the principle is exactly the same as if equal installments of capital and labor were invested on four different grades of land returning twenty fifteen ten and five bushels for each installment <\s>
<s> or as if in the table on page 240 a b c and d each represented different installments of the same amount of labor and capital put upon the same spot of ground instead of being as there put upon different grades of land <\s>
<s> the rent of all land is measured by the excess of the return to the whole capital employed on it above what is necessary to replace the capital with the ordinary rate of profit or in other words above what the same capital would yield if it were all employed in as disadvantageous circumstances as the least productive portion of it whether that least productive portion of capital is rendered so by being employed on the worst soil or by being expended in extorting more produce from land which already yielded as much as it could be made to part with on easier terms <\s>
<s> it will be true that the farmer requires the ordinary rate of profit on the whole of his capital that whatever it returns to him beyond this he is obliged to pay to the landlord but will not consent to pay more that there is a portion of capital applied to agriculture in such circumstances of productiveness as to yield only the ordinary profits and that the difference between the produce of this and of any other capital of similar amount is the measure of the tribute which that other capital can and will pay under the name of rent to the landlord <\s>
<s> this constitutes a law of rent as near the truth as such a law can possibly be though of course modified or disturbed in individual cases by pending contracts individual miscalculations the influence of habit and even the particular feelings and dispositions of the persons concerned <\s>
<s> the law of rent in the economic sense operates in the united states as truly as elsewhere although there is no separate class of landlords here <\s>
<s> with us almost all land is owned by the cultivator so that two functions those of the landlord and farmer are both united in one person <\s>
<s> although one payment is made it is still just as distinctly made up of two parts one of which is a payment to the owner for the superior quality of his soil and the other a payment to the same person if the owner is the cultivator of profit on the farmers working capital <\s>
<s> land which in the united states will only return enough to pay a profit on this capital can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> and land which can pay more than a profit on this working capital returns that excess as rent even if the farmer is also the owner and landlord <\s>
<s> the principle which regulates the amount of that excesswhich is the essential pointis the principle which determines the amount of economic rent and it holds true in the united states or finland provided only that different grades of land are called into cultivation <\s>
<s> the governing principle is the same no matter whether a payment is made to one man as profit and to another as rent or whether the two payments are made to the same man in two capacities <\s>
<s> it has been urged that the law of rent does not hold in the united states because    the price of grain and other agricultural produce has not risen in proportion to the increase of our numbers as it ought to have done if ricardos theory were true but has fallen since 1830 though since that time our population has been more than tripled    181 this overlooks the fact that we have not even yet taken up all our best agricultural lands so that for some products the law of diminishing productiveness has not yet shown itself <\s>
<s> the reason is that the extension of our railway system has only of late years brought the really good grain lands into cultivation <\s>
<s> the fact that there has been no rise in agricultural products is due to the enormous extent of marvelously fertile grain lands in the west and to the cheapness of transportation from those districts to the seaboard <\s>
<s> for a general understanding of the law of rent the following table will show how under constant increase of population represented by four different advances of population in the first column first the best and then the poorer lands are brought into cultivation <\s>

<s> opposing views of the law of rent <\s>
<s> under the name of rent many payments are commonly included which are not a remuneration for the original powers of the land itself but for capital expended on it <\s>
<s> the buildings are as distinct a thing from the farm as the stock or the timber on it and what is paid for them can no more be called rent of land than a payment for cattle would be if it were the custom that the landlord should stock the farm for the tenant <\s>
<s> the buildings like the cattle are not land but capital regularly consumed and reproduced and all payments made in consideration for them are properly interest <\s>
<s> but with regard to capital actually sunk in improvements and not requiring periodical renewal but spent once for all in giving the land a permanent increase of productiveness it appears to me that the return made to such capital loses altogether the character of profits and is governed by the principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is true that a landlord will not expend capital in improving his estate unless he expects from the improvement an increase of income surpassing the interest of his outlay <\s>
<s> prospectively this increase of income may be regarded as profit but when the expense has been incurred and the improvement made the rent of the improved land is governed by the same rules as that of the unimproved <\s>
<s> carey as well as bastiat has declared that there is a law of increasing returns from land <\s>
<s> he points out that everything now existing could be reproduced to day at a less cost than that involved in its original production owing to our advance in skill knowledge and all the arts of production that for example it costs less to make an axe now than it did five hundred years ago so also with a farm since a farm of a given amount of productiveness can be brought into cultivation at less cost to day than that originally spent upon it <\s>
<s> the gain of society has we all admit been such that we produce almost everything at a less cost now than long ago but to class a farm and an axe together overlooks in the most remarkable way the fact that land can not be created by labor and capital while axes can and that too indefinitely <\s>
<s> nor can the produce from the land be increased indefinitely at a diminishing cost <\s>
<s> this is sometimes denied by the appeal to facts    it can be abundantly proved that if we take any two periods sufficiently distant to afford a fair test whether fifty or one hundred or five hundred years the production of the land relatively to the labor employed upon it has progressively become greater and greater    182 but this does not prove that an existing tendency to diminishing returns has not been more than offset by the progress of the arts and improvements <\s>
<s>    the advance of a ship against wind and tide is no proof that there is no wind and tide    in a work entitled    the past the present and the future    mr <\s>
<s> carey takes a ground of objection to the ricardo theory of rent namely that in point of historical fact the lands first brought under cultivation are not the most fertile but the barren lands <\s>
<s>    we find the settler invariably occupying the high and thin lands requiring little clearing and no drainage <\s>
<s> with the growth of population and wealth other soils yielding a larger return to labor are always brought into activity with a constantly increasing return to the labor expended upon them    in whatever order the lands come into cultivation those which when cultivated yield the least return in proportion to the labor required for their culture will always regulate the price of agricultural produce and all other lands will pay a rent simply equivalent to the excess of their produce over this minimum <\s>
<s> whatever unguarded expressions may have been occasionally used in describing the law of rent these two propositions are all that was ever intended by it <\s>
<s> carey could show that the return to labor from the land agricultural skill and science being supposed the same is not a diminishing return he would overthrow a principle much more fundamental than any law of rent <\s>
<s> but in this he has wholly failed <\s>
<s> another objection taken against the law of diminishing returns and so against the law of rent is that the potential increase of food e g of a grain of wheat is far greater than that of man 183 no one disputes the fact that one grain of wheat can reproduce itself more times than man and that too in a geometric increase but not without land <\s>
<s> a grain of wheat needs land in which it can multiply itself and this necessary element of its increase is limited and it is the very thing which limits the multiplication of the grains of wheat <\s>
<s> on the same piece of land one can not get more than what comes from one act of reproduction in the grain <\s>
<s> if one grain produces 100 of its kind doubling the capital will not repeatedly cause a geometric increase in the ratio of reproduction of each grain on this same land so that one grain by one process produces of its kind 200 400 800 or 1,600 because you can not multiply the land in any such ratio as would accompany this potential reduplication of the grain <\s>
<s> this objection would not seem worth answering were it not that it furnishes some difficulty to really honest inquirers <\s>
<s> others again allege as an objection against ricardo that if all land were of equal fertility it might still yield a rent <\s>
<s> but ricardo says precisely the same <\s>
<s> it is also distinctly a portion of ricardos doctrine that even apart from differences of situation the land of a country supposed to be of uniform fertility would all of it on a certain supposition pay rent namely if the demand of the community required that it should all be cultivated and cultivated beyond the point at which a further application of capital begins to be attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> this is simply the question before discussed whether if only one class of land were cultivated some agricultural capital would pay rent or not <\s>
<s> it all depends on the fact whether populationand so the demand for foodhas increased to the point where it calls out a recognition of the diminishing productiveness of the soil <\s>
<s> in that case different capitals would be invested so that there would be different returns to the same amount of capital and the prior or more advantageous investments of capital on the land would yield more than the ordinary rate of profit which could be claimed as rent <\s>
<s> perry 184 admits the law of diminishing returns but holds that    as land is capital and as every form of capital may be loaned or rented and thus become fruitful in the hands of another the rent of land does not differ essentially in its nature from the rent of buildings in cities or from the interest of money    henry george admits ricardos law of rent to its full extent but very curiously says    irrespective of the increase of population the effect of improvements in methods of production and exchange is to increase rent .... <\s>
<s> the effect of labor saving improvements will be to increase the production of wealth <\s>
<s> now for the production of wealth two things are required labor and land <\s>
<s> therefore the effect of labor saving improvements will be to extend the demand for land and wherever the limit of the quality of land in use is reached to bring into cultivation lands of less natural productiveness or to extend cultivation on the same lands to a point of lower natural productiveness <\s>
<s> and thus while the primary effect of labor saving improvements is to increase the power of labor the secondary effect is to extend cultivation and where this lowers the margin of cultivation to increase rent    185 francis bowen 186 rejects ricardos law and says    rent depends not on the increase but on the distribution of the populationasserting that the existence of large cities and towns determines the amount of rent paid by neighboring land 187   6 <\s>
<s> rent does not enter into the cost of production of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent does not really form any part of the expenses of agricultural production or of the advances of the capitalist <\s>
<s> the grounds on which this assertion was made are now apparent <\s>
<s> it is true that all tenant farmers and many other classes of producers pay rent <\s>
<s> but we have now seen that whoever cultivates land paying a rent for it gets in return for his rent an instrument of superior power to other instruments of the same kind for which no rent is paid <\s>
<s> the superiority of the instrument is in exact proportion to the rent paid for it <\s>
<s> if a few persons had steam engines of superior power to all others in existence but limited by physical laws to a number short of the demand the rent which a manufacturer would be willing to pay for one of these steam engines could not be looked upon as an addition to his outlay because by the use of it he would save in his other expenses the equivalent of what it cost him without it he could not do the same quantity of work unless at an additional expense equal to the rent <\s>
<s> the same thing is true of land <\s>
<s> the real expenses of production are those incurred on the worst land or by the capital employed in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> this land or capital pays as we have seen no rent but the expenses to which it is subject cause all other land or agricultural capital to be subjected to an equivalent expense in the form of rent <\s>
<s> whoever does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantages and the rent which he pays does not place him in a worse position than but only in the same position as his fellow producer who pays no rent but whose instrument is one of inferior efficiency <\s>
<s> soils are of every grade some which if cultivated might replace the capital but give no profit some give a slight but not an ordinary profit some the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> that is    there is a point up to which it is profitable to cultivate and beyond which it is not profitable to cultivate <\s>
<s> the price of corn will not for any long time remain at a higher rate than is sufficient to cover with ordinary profit the cost of that portion of the general crop which is raised at greatest expense    188 for similar reasons the price will not remain at a lower rate <\s>
<s> if then the cost of production of grain is determined by that land which replaces the capital yields only the ordinary profit and pays no rent rent forms no part of this cost since that land does not and can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> mcleod 189 however says it is not the cost of production which regulates the value of agricultural produce but the value which regulates the cost <\s>
<s> definitions of value in use exchange value and price <\s>
<s> it is evident that of the two great departments of political economy the production of wealth and its distribution the consideration of value has to do with the latter alone and with that only so far as competition and not usage or custom is the distributing agency <\s>
<s> the use of a thing in political economy means its capacity to satisfy a desire or serve a purpose <\s>
<s> diamonds have this capacity in a high degree and unless they had it would not bear any price <\s>
<s> value in use or as mr <\s>
<s> de quincey calls it teleologic value is the extreme limit of value in exchange <\s>
<s> the exchange value of a thing may fall short to any amount of its value in use but that it can ever exceed the value in use implies a contradiction it supposes that persons will give to possess a thing more than the utmost value which they themselves put upon it as a means of gratifying their inclinations <\s>
<s> the word value when used without adjunct always means in political economy value in exchange <\s>
<s> exchange value requires to be distinguished from price <\s>
<s> writers have employed price to express the value of a thing in relation to moneythe quantity of money for which it will exchange <\s>
<s> moreover suppose that lands down to grade three paid rent when a took the farm now if the price of produce rises slightly grade four may pay something but possibly not enough to warrant any rent going to a landlord <\s>
<s> a will put capital on it for this return but certainly not until the price warrants it that is not until the price will return him at least the cost of working the land plus the profit on his outlay <\s>
<s> but the community needed this land or the price would not have gone up to the point which makes possible its cultivation even for a profit without rent <\s>
<s> there must always be somewhere some land affected in just this way <\s>
<s>    or to the capital employed in the least advantageous circumstances <\s>
<s> let us however suppose that there were a validity in this objection which can by no means be conceded to it that when the demand of the community had forced up food to such a price as would remunerate the expense of producing it from a certain quality of soil it happened nevertheless that all the soil of that quality was withheld from cultivation the increase of produce which the wants of society required would for the time be obtained wholly as it always is partially not by an extension of cultivation but by an increased application of labor and capital to land already cultivated <\s>
<s> now we have already seen that this increased application of capital other things being unaltered is always attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> the rise of price enables measures to be taken for increasing the produce which could not have been taken with profit at the previous price <\s>
<s> the farmer uses more expensive manures or manures land which he formerly left to nature or procures lime or marl from a distance as a dressing for the soil or pulverizes or weeds it more thoroughly or drains irrigates or subsoils portions of it which at former prices would not have paid the cost of the operation and so forth <\s>
<s> the farmer or improver will only consider whether the outlay he makes for the purpose will be returned to him with the ordinary profit and not whether any surplus will remain for rent <\s>
<s> even therefore if it were the fact that there is never any land taken into cultivation for which rent and that too of an amount worth taking into consideration was not paid it would be true nevertheless that there is always some agricultural capital which pays no rent because it returns nothing beyond the ordinary rate of profit this capital being the portion of capital last appliedthat to which the last addition to the produce was due or to express the essentials of the case in one phrase that which is applied in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> but the same amount of demand and the same price which enable this least productive portion of capital barely to replace itself with the ordinary profit enable every other portion to yield a surplus proportioned to the advantage it possesses <\s>

<s> this land or capital pays as we have seen no rent but the expenses to which it is subject cause all other land or agricultural capital to be subjected to an equivalent expense in the form of rent <\s>
<s> whoever does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantages and the rent which he pays does not place him in a worse position than but only in the same position as his fellow producer who pays no rent but whose instrument is one of inferior efficiency <\s>
<s> soils are of every grade some which if cultivated might replace the capital but give no profit some give a slight but not an ordinary profit some the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> that is    there is a point up to which it is profitable to cultivate and beyond which it is not profitable to cultivate <\s>
<s> the price of corn will not for any long time remain at a higher rate than is sufficient to cover with ordinary profit the cost of that portion of the general crop which is raised at greatest expense    188 for similar reasons the price will not remain at a lower rate <\s>
<s> if then the cost of production of grain is determined by that land which replaces the capital yields only the ordinary profit and pays no rent rent forms no part of this cost since that land does not and can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> mcleod 189 however says it is not the cost of production which regulates the value of agricultural produce but the value which regulates the cost <\s>
<s> definitions of value in use exchange value and price <\s>
<s> it is evident that of the two great departments of political economy the production of wealth and its distribution the consideration of value has to do with the latter alone and with that only so far as competition and not usage or custom is the distributing agency <\s>

<s> diamonds have this capacity in a high degree and unless they had it would not bear any price <\s>
<s> value in use or as mr <\s>
<s> de quincey calls it teleologic value is the extreme limit of value in exchange <\s>
<s> the exchange value of a thing may fall short to any amount of its value in use but that it can ever exceed the value in use implies a contradiction it supposes that persons will give to possess a thing more than the utmost value which they themselves put upon it as a means of gratifying their inclinations <\s>
<s> the word value when used without adjunct always means in political economy value in exchange <\s>
<s> exchange value requires to be distinguished from price <\s>
<s> writers have employed price to express the value of a thing in relation to moneythe quantity of money for which it will exchange <\s>
<s> moreover suppose that lands down to grade three paid rent when a took the farm now if the price of produce rises slightly grade four may pay something but possibly not enough to warrant any rent going to a landlord <\s>
<s> a will put capital on it for this return but certainly not until the price warrants it that is not until the price will return him at least the cost of working the land plus the profit on his outlay <\s>
<s> but the community needed this land or the price would not have gone up to the point which makes possible its cultivation even for a profit without rent <\s>
<s> there must always be somewhere some land affected in just this way <\s>
<s>    or to the capital employed in the least advantageous circumstances <\s>
<s> let us however suppose that there were a validity in this objection which can by no means be conceded to it that when the demand of the community had forced up food to such a price as would remunerate the expense of producing it from a certain quality of soil it happened nevertheless that all the soil of that quality was withheld from cultivation the increase of produce which the wants of society required would for the time be obtained wholly as it always is partially not by an extension of cultivation but by an increased application of labor and capital to land already cultivated <\s>
<s> now we have already seen that this increased application of capital other things being unaltered is always attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> the rise of price enables measures to be taken for increasing the produce which could not have been taken with profit at the previous price <\s>
<s> the farmer uses more expensive manures or manures land which he formerly left to nature or procures lime or marl from a distance as a dressing for the soil or pulverizes or weeds it more thoroughly or drains irrigates or subsoils portions of it which at former prices would not have paid the cost of the operation and so forth <\s>
<s> the farmer or improver will only consider whether the outlay he makes for the purpose will be returned to him with the ordinary profit and not whether any surplus will remain for rent <\s>
<s> even therefore if it were the fact that there is never any land taken into cultivation for which rent and that too of an amount worth taking into consideration was not paid it would be true nevertheless that there is always some agricultural capital which pays no rent because it returns nothing beyond the ordinary rate of profit this capital being the portion of capital last appliedthat to which the last addition to the produce was due or to express the essentials of the case in one phrase that which is applied in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> but the same amount of demand and the same price which enable this least productive portion of capital barely to replace itself with the ordinary profit enable every other portion to yield a surplus proportioned to the advantage it possesses <\s>
<s> and this surplus it is which competition enables the landlord to appropriate <\s>
<s> if land were all occupied and of only one grade the first installment of labor and capital produced we will say twenty bushels of wheat when the price of wheat rose and it became profitable to resort to greater expense on the soil a second installment of the same amount of labor and capital when applied however only yielded fifteen bushels more a third ten bushels more and a fourth five bushels more <\s>
<s> the soil now gives fifty bushels only under the highest pressure <\s>
<s> but if it was profitable to invest the same installment of labor and capital simply for the five bushels that at first had received a return of twenty bushels the price must have gone up so that five bushels should sell for as much as the twenty did formerly so mutatis mutandis of installments second and third <\s>
<s> so that if the demand is such as to require all of the fifty bushels the agricultural capital which produced the five bushels will be the standard according to which the rent of the capital which grew twenty fifteen and ten bushels respectively is measured <\s>
<s> the principle is exactly the same as if equal installments of capital and labor were invested on four different grades of land returning twenty fifteen ten and five bushels for each installment <\s>
<s> or as if in the table on page 240 a b c and d each represented different installments of the same amount of labor and capital put upon the same spot of ground instead of being as there put upon different grades of land <\s>
<s> the rent of all land is measured by the excess of the return to the whole capital employed on it above what is necessary to replace the capital with the ordinary rate of profit or in other words above what the same capital would yield if it were all employed in as disadvantageous circumstances as the least productive portion of it whether that least productive portion of capital is rendered so by being employed on the worst soil or by being expended in extorting more produce from land which already yielded as much as it could be made to part with on easier terms <\s>
<s> it will be true that the farmer requires the ordinary rate of profit on the whole of his capital that whatever it returns to him beyond this he is obliged to pay to the landlord but will not consent to pay more that there is a portion of capital applied to agriculture in such circumstances of productiveness as to yield only the ordinary profits and that the difference between the produce of this and of any other capital of similar amount is the measure of the tribute which that other capital can and will pay under the name of rent to the landlord <\s>
<s> this constitutes a law of rent as near the truth as such a law can possibly be though of course modified or disturbed in individual cases by pending contracts individual miscalculations the influence of habit and even the particular feelings and dispositions of the persons concerned <\s>
<s> the law of rent in the economic sense operates in the united states as truly as elsewhere although there is no separate class of landlords here <\s>
<s> with us almost all land is owned by the cultivator so that two functions those of the landlord and farmer are both united in one person <\s>
<s> although one payment is made it is still just as distinctly made up of two parts one of which is a payment to the owner for the superior quality of his soil and the other a payment to the same person if the owner is the cultivator of profit on the farmers working capital <\s>
<s> land which in the united states will only return enough to pay a profit on this capital can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> and land which can pay more than a profit on this working capital returns that excess as rent even if the farmer is also the owner and landlord <\s>
<s> the principle which regulates the amount of that excesswhich is the essential pointis the principle which determines the amount of economic rent and it holds true in the united states or finland provided only that different grades of land are called into cultivation <\s>
<s> the governing principle is the same no matter whether a payment is made to one man as profit and to another as rent or whether the two payments are made to the same man in two capacities <\s>
<s> it has been urged that the law of rent does not hold in the united states because    the price of grain and other agricultural produce has not risen in proportion to the increase of our numbers as it ought to have done if ricardos theory were true but has fallen since 1830 though since that time our population has been more than tripled    181 this overlooks the fact that we have not even yet taken up all our best agricultural lands so that for some products the law of diminishing productiveness has not yet shown itself <\s>
<s> the reason is that the extension of our railway system has only of late years brought the really good grain lands into cultivation <\s>
<s> the fact that there has been no rise in agricultural products is due to the enormous extent of marvelously fertile grain lands in the west and to the cheapness of transportation from those districts to the seaboard <\s>
<s> for a general understanding of the law of rent the following table will show how under constant increase of population represented by four different advances of population in the first column first the best and then the poorer lands are brought into cultivation <\s>
<s> we will suppose 1 that the most fertile land a at first pays no rent then 2 when more food is wanted than land a can supply it will be profitable to till land b but which as yet pays no rent <\s>

<s> opposing views of the law of rent <\s>
<s> under the name of rent many payments are commonly included which are not a remuneration for the original powers of the land itself but for capital expended on it <\s>
<s> the buildings are as distinct a thing from the farm as the stock or the timber on it and what is paid for them can no more be called rent of land than a payment for cattle would be if it were the custom that the landlord should stock the farm for the tenant <\s>
<s> the buildings like the cattle are not land but capital regularly consumed and reproduced and all payments made in consideration for them are properly interest <\s>
<s> but with regard to capital actually sunk in improvements and not requiring periodical renewal but spent once for all in giving the land a permanent increase of productiveness it appears to me that the return made to such capital loses altogether the character of profits and is governed by the principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is true that a landlord will not expend capital in improving his estate unless he expects from the improvement an increase of income surpassing the interest of his outlay <\s>
<s> prospectively this increase of income may be regarded as profit but when the expense has been incurred and the improvement made the rent of the improved land is governed by the same rules as that of the unimproved <\s>
<s> carey as well as bastiat has declared that there is a law of increasing returns from land <\s>
<s> he points out that everything now existing could be reproduced to day at a less cost than that involved in its original production owing to our advance in skill knowledge and all the arts of production that for example it costs less to make an axe now than it did five hundred years ago so also with a farm since a farm of a given amount of productiveness can be brought into cultivation at less cost to day than that originally spent upon it <\s>
<s> the gain of society has we all admit been such that we produce almost everything at a less cost now than long ago but to class a farm and an axe together overlooks in the most remarkable way the fact that land can not be created by labor and capital while axes can and that too indefinitely <\s>
<s> nor can the produce from the land be increased indefinitely at a diminishing cost <\s>
<s> this is sometimes denied by the appeal to facts    it can be abundantly proved that if we take any two periods sufficiently distant to afford a fair test whether fifty or one hundred or five hundred years the production of the land relatively to the labor employed upon it has progressively become greater and greater    182 but this does not prove that an existing tendency to diminishing returns has not been more than offset by the progress of the arts and improvements <\s>
<s>    the advance of a ship against wind and tide is no proof that there is no wind and tide    in a work entitled    the past the present and the future    mr <\s>
<s> carey takes a ground of objection to the ricardo theory of rent namely that in point of historical fact the lands first brought under cultivation are not the most fertile but the barren lands <\s>
<s>    we find the settler invariably occupying the high and thin lands requiring little clearing and no drainage <\s>
<s> with the growth of population and wealth other soils yielding a larger return to labor are always brought into activity with a constantly increasing return to the labor expended upon them    in whatever order the lands come into cultivation those which when cultivated yield the least return in proportion to the labor required for their culture will always regulate the price of agricultural produce and all other lands will pay a rent simply equivalent to the excess of their produce over this minimum <\s>
<s> whatever unguarded expressions may have been occasionally used in describing the law of rent these two propositions are all that was ever intended by it <\s>
<s> carey could show that the return to labor from the land agricultural skill and science being supposed the same is not a diminishing return he would overthrow a principle much more fundamental than any law of rent <\s>
<s> but in this he has wholly failed <\s>
<s> another objection taken against the law of diminishing returns and so against the law of rent is that the potential increase of food e g of a grain of wheat is far greater than that of man 183 no one disputes the fact that one grain of wheat can reproduce itself more times than man and that too in a geometric increase but not without land <\s>
<s> a grain of wheat needs land in which it can multiply itself and this necessary element of its increase is limited and it is the very thing which limits the multiplication of the grains of wheat <\s>
<s> on the same piece of land one can not get more than what comes from one act of reproduction in the grain <\s>
<s> if one grain produces 100 of its kind doubling the capital will not repeatedly cause a geometric increase in the ratio of reproduction of each grain on this same land so that one grain by one process produces of its kind 200 400 800 or 1,600 because you can not multiply the land in any such ratio as would accompany this potential reduplication of the grain <\s>
<s> this objection would not seem worth answering were it not that it furnishes some difficulty to really honest inquirers <\s>
<s> others again allege as an objection against ricardo that if all land were of equal fertility it might still yield a rent <\s>
<s> but ricardo says precisely the same <\s>
<s> it is also distinctly a portion of ricardos doctrine that even apart from differences of situation the land of a country supposed to be of uniform fertility would all of it on a certain supposition pay rent namely if the demand of the community required that it should all be cultivated and cultivated beyond the point at which a further application of capital begins to be attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> this is simply the question before discussed whether if only one class of land were cultivated some agricultural capital would pay rent or not <\s>
<s> it all depends on the fact whether populationand so the demand for foodhas increased to the point where it calls out a recognition of the diminishing productiveness of the soil <\s>
<s> in that case different capitals would be invested so that there would be different returns to the same amount of capital and the prior or more advantageous investments of capital on the land would yield more than the ordinary rate of profit which could be claimed as rent <\s>
<s> perry 184 admits the law of diminishing returns but holds that    as land is capital and as every form of capital may be loaned or rented and thus become fruitful in the hands of another the rent of land does not differ essentially in its nature from the rent of buildings in cities or from the interest of money    henry george admits ricardos law of rent to its full extent but very curiously says    irrespective of the increase of population the effect of improvements in methods of production and exchange is to increase rent .... <\s>
<s> the effect of labor saving improvements will be to increase the production of wealth <\s>
<s> now for the production of wealth two things are required labor and land <\s>
<s> therefore the effect of labor saving improvements will be to extend the demand for land and wherever the limit of the quality of land in use is reached to bring into cultivation lands of less natural productiveness or to extend cultivation on the same lands to a point of lower natural productiveness <\s>
<s> and thus while the primary effect of labor saving improvements is to increase the power of labor the secondary effect is to extend cultivation and where this lowers the margin of cultivation to increase rent    185 francis bowen 186 rejects ricardos law and says    rent depends not on the increase but on the distribution of the populationasserting that the existence of large cities and towns determines the amount of rent paid by neighboring land 187   6 <\s>
<s> rent does not enter into the cost of production of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent does not really form any part of the expenses of agricultural production or of the advances of the capitalist <\s>
<s> the grounds on which this assertion was made are now apparent <\s>
<s> it is true that all tenant farmers and many other classes of producers pay rent <\s>
<s> but we have now seen that whoever cultivates land paying a rent for it gets in return for his rent an instrument of superior power to other instruments of the same kind for which no rent is paid <\s>
<s> the superiority of the instrument is in exact proportion to the rent paid for it <\s>
<s> if a few persons had steam engines of superior power to all others in existence but limited by physical laws to a number short of the demand the rent which a manufacturer would be willing to pay for one of these steam engines could not be looked upon as an addition to his outlay because by the use of it he would save in his other expenses the equivalent of what it cost him without it he could not do the same quantity of work unless at an additional expense equal to the rent <\s>
<s> the same thing is true of land <\s>
<s> the real expenses of production are those incurred on the worst land or by the capital employed in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> this land or capital pays as we have seen no rent but the expenses to which it is subject cause all other land or agricultural capital to be subjected to an equivalent expense in the form of rent <\s>
<s> whoever does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantages and the rent which he pays does not place him in a worse position than but only in the same position as his fellow producer who pays no rent but whose instrument is one of inferior efficiency <\s>
<s> soils are of every grade some which if cultivated might replace the capital but give no profit some give a slight but not an ordinary profit some the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> that is    there is a point up to which it is profitable to cultivate and beyond which it is not profitable to cultivate <\s>

<s> if one grain produces 100 of its kind doubling the capital will not repeatedly cause a geometric increase in the ratio of reproduction of each grain on this same land so that one grain by one process produces of its kind 200 400 800 or 1,600 because you can not multiply the land in any such ratio as would accompany this potential reduplication of the grain <\s>
<s> this objection would not seem worth answering were it not that it furnishes some difficulty to really honest inquirers <\s>
<s> others again allege as an objection against ricardo that if all land were of equal fertility it might still yield a rent <\s>
<s> but ricardo says precisely the same <\s>
<s> it is also distinctly a portion of ricardos doctrine that even apart from differences of situation the land of a country supposed to be of uniform fertility would all of it on a certain supposition pay rent namely if the demand of the community required that it should all be cultivated and cultivated beyond the point at which a further application of capital begins to be attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> this is simply the question before discussed whether if only one class of land were cultivated some agricultural capital would pay rent or not <\s>

<s> in that case different capitals would be invested so that there would be different returns to the same amount of capital and the prior or more advantageous investments of capital on the land would yield more than the ordinary rate of profit which could be claimed as rent <\s>
<s> perry 184 admits the law of diminishing returns but holds that    as land is capital and as every form of capital may be loaned or rented and thus become fruitful in the hands of another the rent of land does not differ essentially in its nature from the rent of buildings in cities or from the interest of money    henry george admits ricardos law of rent to its full extent but very curiously says    irrespective of the increase of population the effect of improvements in methods of production and exchange is to increase rent .... <\s>
<s> the effect of labor saving improvements will be to increase the production of wealth <\s>
<s> now for the production of wealth two things are required labor and land <\s>
<s> therefore the effect of labor saving improvements will be to extend the demand for land and wherever the limit of the quality of land in use is reached to bring into cultivation lands of less natural productiveness or to extend cultivation on the same lands to a point of lower natural productiveness <\s>
<s> and thus while the primary effect of labor saving improvements is to increase the power of labor the secondary effect is to extend cultivation and where this lowers the margin of cultivation to increase rent    185 francis bowen 186 rejects ricardos law and says    rent depends not on the increase but on the distribution of the populationasserting that the existence of large cities and towns determines the amount of rent paid by neighboring land 187   6 <\s>
<s> rent does not enter into the cost of production of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent does not really form any part of the expenses of agricultural production or of the advances of the capitalist <\s>
<s> the grounds on which this assertion was made are now apparent <\s>
<s> it is true that all tenant farmers and many other classes of producers pay rent <\s>
<s> but we have now seen that whoever cultivates land paying a rent for it gets in return for his rent an instrument of superior power to other instruments of the same kind for which no rent is paid <\s>
<s> the superiority of the instrument is in exact proportion to the rent paid for it <\s>
<s> if a few persons had steam engines of superior power to all others in existence but limited by physical laws to a number short of the demand the rent which a manufacturer would be willing to pay for one of these steam engines could not be looked upon as an addition to his outlay because by the use of it he would save in his other expenses the equivalent of what it cost him without it he could not do the same quantity of work unless at an additional expense equal to the rent <\s>
<s> the same thing is true of land <\s>
<s> the real expenses of production are those incurred on the worst land or by the capital employed in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> this land or capital pays as we have seen no rent but the expenses to which it is subject cause all other land or agricultural capital to be subjected to an equivalent expense in the form of rent <\s>
<s> whoever does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantages and the rent which he pays does not place him in a worse position than but only in the same position as his fellow producer who pays no rent but whose instrument is one of inferior efficiency <\s>
<s> soils are of every grade some which if cultivated might replace the capital but give no profit some give a slight but not an ordinary profit some the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> that is    there is a point up to which it is profitable to cultivate and beyond which it is not profitable to cultivate <\s>
<s> the price of corn will not for any long time remain at a higher rate than is sufficient to cover with ordinary profit the cost of that portion of the general crop which is raised at greatest expense    188 for similar reasons the price will not remain at a lower rate <\s>
<s> if then the cost of production of grain is determined by that land which replaces the capital yields only the ordinary profit and pays no rent rent forms no part of this cost since that land does not and can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> mcleod 189 however says it is not the cost of production which regulates the value of agricultural produce but the value which regulates the cost <\s>
<s> definitions of value in use exchange value and price <\s>
<s> it is evident that of the two great departments of political economy the production of wealth and its distribution the consideration of value has to do with the latter alone and with that only so far as competition and not usage or custom is the distributing agency <\s>
<s> the use of a thing in political economy means its capacity to satisfy a desire or serve a purpose <\s>
<s> diamonds have this capacity in a high degree and unless they had it would not bear any price <\s>
<s> value in use or as mr <\s>
<s> de quincey calls it teleologic value is the extreme limit of value in exchange <\s>
<s> the exchange value of a thing may fall short to any amount of its value in use but that it can ever exceed the value in use implies a contradiction it supposes that persons will give to possess a thing more than the utmost value which they themselves put upon it as a means of gratifying their inclinations <\s>
<s> the word value when used without adjunct always means in political economy value in exchange <\s>
<s> exchange value requires to be distinguished from price <\s>
<s> writers have employed price to express the value of a thing in relation to moneythe quantity of money for which it will exchange <\s>
<s> moreover suppose that lands down to grade three paid rent when a took the farm now if the price of produce rises slightly grade four may pay something but possibly not enough to warrant any rent going to a landlord <\s>
<s> a will put capital on it for this return but certainly not until the price warrants it that is not until the price will return him at least the cost of working the land plus the profit on his outlay <\s>
<s> but the community needed this land or the price would not have gone up to the point which makes possible its cultivation even for a profit without rent <\s>
<s> there must always be somewhere some land affected in just this way <\s>
<s>    or to the capital employed in the least advantageous circumstances <\s>
<s> let us however suppose that there were a validity in this objection which can by no means be conceded to it that when the demand of the community had forced up food to such a price as would remunerate the expense of producing it from a certain quality of soil it happened nevertheless that all the soil of that quality was withheld from cultivation the increase of produce which the wants of society required would for the time be obtained wholly as it always is partially not by an extension of cultivation but by an increased application of labor and capital to land already cultivated <\s>
<s> now we have already seen that this increased application of capital other things being unaltered is always attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> the rise of price enables measures to be taken for increasing the produce which could not have been taken with profit at the previous price <\s>
<s> the farmer uses more expensive manures or manures land which he formerly left to nature or procures lime or marl from a distance as a dressing for the soil or pulverizes or weeds it more thoroughly or drains irrigates or subsoils portions of it which at former prices would not have paid the cost of the operation and so forth <\s>
<s> the farmer or improver will only consider whether the outlay he makes for the purpose will be returned to him with the ordinary profit and not whether any surplus will remain for rent <\s>
<s> even therefore if it were the fact that there is never any land taken into cultivation for which rent and that too of an amount worth taking into consideration was not paid it would be true nevertheless that there is always some agricultural capital which pays no rent because it returns nothing beyond the ordinary rate of profit this capital being the portion of capital last appliedthat to which the last addition to the produce was due or to express the essentials of the case in one phrase that which is applied in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> but the same amount of demand and the same price which enable this least productive portion of capital barely to replace itself with the ordinary profit enable every other portion to yield a surplus proportioned to the advantage it possesses <\s>
<s> and this surplus it is which competition enables the landlord to appropriate <\s>
<s> if land were all occupied and of only one grade the first installment of labor and capital produced we will say twenty bushels of wheat when the price of wheat rose and it became profitable to resort to greater expense on the soil a second installment of the same amount of labor and capital when applied however only yielded fifteen bushels more a third ten bushels more and a fourth five bushels more <\s>
<s> the soil now gives fifty bushels only under the highest pressure <\s>
<s> but if it was profitable to invest the same installment of labor and capital simply for the five bushels that at first had received a return of twenty bushels the price must have gone up so that five bushels should sell for as much as the twenty did formerly so mutatis mutandis of installments second and third <\s>
<s> so that if the demand is such as to require all of the fifty bushels the agricultural capital which produced the five bushels will be the standard according to which the rent of the capital which grew twenty fifteen and ten bushels respectively is measured <\s>
<s> the principle is exactly the same as if equal installments of capital and labor were invested on four different grades of land returning twenty fifteen ten and five bushels for each installment <\s>
<s> or as if in the table on page 240 a b c and d each represented different installments of the same amount of labor and capital put upon the same spot of ground instead of being as there put upon different grades of land <\s>
<s> the rent of all land is measured by the excess of the return to the whole capital employed on it above what is necessary to replace the capital with the ordinary rate of profit or in other words above what the same capital would yield if it were all employed in as disadvantageous circumstances as the least productive portion of it whether that least productive portion of capital is rendered so by being employed on the worst soil or by being expended in extorting more produce from land which already yielded as much as it could be made to part with on easier terms <\s>
<s> it will be true that the farmer requires the ordinary rate of profit on the whole of his capital that whatever it returns to him beyond this he is obliged to pay to the landlord but will not consent to pay more that there is a portion of capital applied to agriculture in such circumstances of productiveness as to yield only the ordinary profits and that the difference between the produce of this and of any other capital of similar amount is the measure of the tribute which that other capital can and will pay under the name of rent to the landlord <\s>
<s> this constitutes a law of rent as near the truth as such a law can possibly be though of course modified or disturbed in individual cases by pending contracts individual miscalculations the influence of habit and even the particular feelings and dispositions of the persons concerned <\s>
<s> the law of rent in the economic sense operates in the united states as truly as elsewhere although there is no separate class of landlords here <\s>
<s> with us almost all land is owned by the cultivator so that two functions those of the landlord and farmer are both united in one person <\s>
<s> although one payment is made it is still just as distinctly made up of two parts one of which is a payment to the owner for the superior quality of his soil and the other a payment to the same person if the owner is the cultivator of profit on the farmers working capital <\s>
<s> land which in the united states will only return enough to pay a profit on this capital can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> and land which can pay more than a profit on this working capital returns that excess as rent even if the farmer is also the owner and landlord <\s>
<s> the principle which regulates the amount of that excesswhich is the essential pointis the principle which determines the amount of economic rent and it holds true in the united states or finland provided only that different grades of land are called into cultivation <\s>
<s> the governing principle is the same no matter whether a payment is made to one man as profit and to another as rent or whether the two payments are made to the same man in two capacities <\s>
<s> it has been urged that the law of rent does not hold in the united states because    the price of grain and other agricultural produce has not risen in proportion to the increase of our numbers as it ought to have done if ricardos theory were true but has fallen since 1830 though since that time our population has been more than tripled    181 this overlooks the fact that we have not even yet taken up all our best agricultural lands so that for some products the law of diminishing productiveness has not yet shown itself <\s>
<s> the reason is that the extension of our railway system has only of late years brought the really good grain lands into cultivation <\s>
<s> the fact that there has been no rise in agricultural products is due to the enormous extent of marvelously fertile grain lands in the west and to the cheapness of transportation from those districts to the seaboard <\s>
<s> for a general understanding of the law of rent the following table will show how under constant increase of population represented by four different advances of population in the first column first the best and then the poorer lands are brought into cultivation <\s>
<s> we will suppose 1 that the most fertile land a at first pays no rent then 2 when more food is wanted than land a can supply it will be profitable to till land b but which as yet pays no rent <\s>

<s> opposing views of the law of rent <\s>
<s> under the name of rent many payments are commonly included which are not a remuneration for the original powers of the land itself but for capital expended on it <\s>
<s> the buildings are as distinct a thing from the farm as the stock or the timber on it and what is paid for them can no more be called rent of land than a payment for cattle would be if it were the custom that the landlord should stock the farm for the tenant <\s>
<s> the buildings like the cattle are not land but capital regularly consumed and reproduced and all payments made in consideration for them are properly interest <\s>
<s> but with regard to capital actually sunk in improvements and not requiring periodical renewal but spent once for all in giving the land a permanent increase of productiveness it appears to me that the return made to such capital loses altogether the character of profits and is governed by the principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is true that a landlord will not expend capital in improving his estate unless he expects from the improvement an increase of income surpassing the interest of his outlay <\s>
<s> prospectively this increase of income may be regarded as profit but when the expense has been incurred and the improvement made the rent of the improved land is governed by the same rules as that of the unimproved <\s>
<s> carey as well as bastiat has declared that there is a law of increasing returns from land <\s>
<s> he points out that everything now existing could be reproduced to day at a less cost than that involved in its original production owing to our advance in skill knowledge and all the arts of production that for example it costs less to make an axe now than it did five hundred years ago so also with a farm since a farm of a given amount of productiveness can be brought into cultivation at less cost to day than that originally spent upon it <\s>
<s> the gain of society has we all admit been such that we produce almost everything at a less cost now than long ago but to class a farm and an axe together overlooks in the most remarkable way the fact that land can not be created by labor and capital while axes can and that too indefinitely <\s>
<s> nor can the produce from the land be increased indefinitely at a diminishing cost <\s>
<s> this is sometimes denied by the appeal to facts    it can be abundantly proved that if we take any two periods sufficiently distant to afford a fair test whether fifty or one hundred or five hundred years the production of the land relatively to the labor employed upon it has progressively become greater and greater    182 but this does not prove that an existing tendency to diminishing returns has not been more than offset by the progress of the arts and improvements <\s>
<s>    the advance of a ship against wind and tide is no proof that there is no wind and tide    in a work entitled    the past the present and the future    mr <\s>
<s> carey takes a ground of objection to the ricardo theory of rent namely that in point of historical fact the lands first brought under cultivation are not the most fertile but the barren lands <\s>
<s>    we find the settler invariably occupying the high and thin lands requiring little clearing and no drainage <\s>
<s> with the growth of population and wealth other soils yielding a larger return to labor are always brought into activity with a constantly increasing return to the labor expended upon them    in whatever order the lands come into cultivation those which when cultivated yield the least return in proportion to the labor required for their culture will always regulate the price of agricultural produce and all other lands will pay a rent simply equivalent to the excess of their produce over this minimum <\s>
<s> whatever unguarded expressions may have been occasionally used in describing the law of rent these two propositions are all that was ever intended by it <\s>
<s> carey could show that the return to labor from the land agricultural skill and science being supposed the same is not a diminishing return he would overthrow a principle much more fundamental than any law of rent <\s>
<s> but in this he has wholly failed <\s>
<s> another objection taken against the law of diminishing returns and so against the law of rent is that the potential increase of food e g of a grain of wheat is far greater than that of man 183 no one disputes the fact that one grain of wheat can reproduce itself more times than man and that too in a geometric increase but not without land <\s>
<s> a grain of wheat needs land in which it can multiply itself and this necessary element of its increase is limited and it is the very thing which limits the multiplication of the grains of wheat <\s>
<s> on the same piece of land one can not get more than what comes from one act of reproduction in the grain <\s>

<s> under the name of rent many payments are commonly included which are not a remuneration for the original powers of the land itself but for capital expended on it <\s>
<s> the buildings are as distinct a thing from the farm as the stock or the timber on it and what is paid for them can no more be called rent of land than a payment for cattle would be if it were the custom that the landlord should stock the farm for the tenant <\s>
<s> the buildings like the cattle are not land but capital regularly consumed and reproduced and all payments made in consideration for them are properly interest <\s>
<s> but with regard to capital actually sunk in improvements and not requiring periodical renewal but spent once for all in giving the land a permanent increase of productiveness it appears to me that the return made to such capital loses altogether the character of profits and is governed by the principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is true that a landlord will not expend capital in improving his estate unless he expects from the improvement an increase of income surpassing the interest of his outlay <\s>
<s> prospectively this increase of income may be regarded as profit but when the expense has been incurred and the improvement made the rent of the improved land is governed by the same rules as that of the unimproved <\s>
<s> carey as well as bastiat has declared that there is a law of increasing returns from land <\s>
<s> he points out that everything now existing could be reproduced to day at a less cost than that involved in its original production owing to our advance in skill knowledge and all the arts of production that for example it costs less to make an axe now than it did five hundred years ago so also with a farm since a farm of a given amount of productiveness can be brought into cultivation at less cost to day than that originally spent upon it <\s>
<s> the gain of society has we all admit been such that we produce almost everything at a less cost now than long ago but to class a farm and an axe together overlooks in the most remarkable way the fact that land can not be created by labor and capital while axes can and that too indefinitely <\s>
<s> nor can the produce from the land be increased indefinitely at a diminishing cost <\s>
<s> this is sometimes denied by the appeal to facts    it can be abundantly proved that if we take any two periods sufficiently distant to afford a fair test whether fifty or one hundred or five hundred years the production of the land relatively to the labor employed upon it has progressively become greater and greater    182 but this does not prove that an existing tendency to diminishing returns has not been more than offset by the progress of the arts and improvements <\s>
<s>    the advance of a ship against wind and tide is no proof that there is no wind and tide    in a work entitled    the past the present and the future    mr <\s>
<s> carey takes a ground of objection to the ricardo theory of rent namely that in point of historical fact the lands first brought under cultivation are not the most fertile but the barren lands <\s>
<s>    we find the settler invariably occupying the high and thin lands requiring little clearing and no drainage <\s>
<s> with the growth of population and wealth other soils yielding a larger return to labor are always brought into activity with a constantly increasing return to the labor expended upon them    in whatever order the lands come into cultivation those which when cultivated yield the least return in proportion to the labor required for their culture will always regulate the price of agricultural produce and all other lands will pay a rent simply equivalent to the excess of their produce over this minimum <\s>
<s> whatever unguarded expressions may have been occasionally used in describing the law of rent these two propositions are all that was ever intended by it <\s>
<s> carey could show that the return to labor from the land agricultural skill and science being supposed the same is not a diminishing return he would overthrow a principle much more fundamental than any law of rent <\s>
<s> but in this he has wholly failed <\s>
<s> another objection taken against the law of diminishing returns and so against the law of rent is that the potential increase of food e g of a grain of wheat is far greater than that of man 183 no one disputes the fact that one grain of wheat can reproduce itself more times than man and that too in a geometric increase but not without land <\s>
<s> a grain of wheat needs land in which it can multiply itself and this necessary element of its increase is limited and it is the very thing which limits the multiplication of the grains of wheat <\s>
<s> on the same piece of land one can not get more than what comes from one act of reproduction in the grain <\s>
<s> if one grain produces 100 of its kind doubling the capital will not repeatedly cause a geometric increase in the ratio of reproduction of each grain on this same land so that one grain by one process produces of its kind 200 400 800 or 1,600 because you can not multiply the land in any such ratio as would accompany this potential reduplication of the grain <\s>
<s> this objection would not seem worth answering were it not that it furnishes some difficulty to really honest inquirers <\s>
<s> others again allege as an objection against ricardo that if all land were of equal fertility it might still yield a rent <\s>
<s> but ricardo says precisely the same <\s>
<s> it is also distinctly a portion of ricardos doctrine that even apart from differences of situation the land of a country supposed to be of uniform fertility would all of it on a certain supposition pay rent namely if the demand of the community required that it should all be cultivated and cultivated beyond the point at which a further application of capital begins to be attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> this is simply the question before discussed whether if only one class of land were cultivated some agricultural capital would pay rent or not <\s>
<s> it all depends on the fact whether populationand so the demand for foodhas increased to the point where it calls out a recognition of the diminishing productiveness of the soil <\s>
<s> in that case different capitals would be invested so that there would be different returns to the same amount of capital and the prior or more advantageous investments of capital on the land would yield more than the ordinary rate of profit which could be claimed as rent <\s>
<s> perry 184 admits the law of diminishing returns but holds that    as land is capital and as every form of capital may be loaned or rented and thus become fruitful in the hands of another the rent of land does not differ essentially in its nature from the rent of buildings in cities or from the interest of money    henry george admits ricardos law of rent to its full extent but very curiously says    irrespective of the increase of population the effect of improvements in methods of production and exchange is to increase rent .... <\s>
<s> the effect of labor saving improvements will be to increase the production of wealth <\s>
<s> now for the production of wealth two things are required labor and land <\s>
<s> therefore the effect of labor saving improvements will be to extend the demand for land and wherever the limit of the quality of land in use is reached to bring into cultivation lands of less natural productiveness or to extend cultivation on the same lands to a point of lower natural productiveness <\s>
<s> and thus while the primary effect of labor saving improvements is to increase the power of labor the secondary effect is to extend cultivation and where this lowers the margin of cultivation to increase rent    185 francis bowen 186 rejects ricardos law and says    rent depends not on the increase but on the distribution of the populationasserting that the existence of large cities and towns determines the amount of rent paid by neighboring land 187   6 <\s>
<s> rent does not enter into the cost of production of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent does not really form any part of the expenses of agricultural production or of the advances of the capitalist <\s>
<s> the grounds on which this assertion was made are now apparent <\s>
<s> it is true that all tenant farmers and many other classes of producers pay rent <\s>
<s> but we have now seen that whoever cultivates land paying a rent for it gets in return for his rent an instrument of superior power to other instruments of the same kind for which no rent is paid <\s>
<s> the superiority of the instrument is in exact proportion to the rent paid for it <\s>
<s> if a few persons had steam engines of superior power to all others in existence but limited by physical laws to a number short of the demand the rent which a manufacturer would be willing to pay for one of these steam engines could not be looked upon as an addition to his outlay because by the use of it he would save in his other expenses the equivalent of what it cost him without it he could not do the same quantity of work unless at an additional expense equal to the rent <\s>
<s> the same thing is true of land <\s>
<s> the real expenses of production are those incurred on the worst land or by the capital employed in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> this land or capital pays as we have seen no rent but the expenses to which it is subject cause all other land or agricultural capital to be subjected to an equivalent expense in the form of rent <\s>
<s> whoever does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantages and the rent which he pays does not place him in a worse position than but only in the same position as his fellow producer who pays no rent but whose instrument is one of inferior efficiency <\s>
<s> soils are of every grade some which if cultivated might replace the capital but give no profit some give a slight but not an ordinary profit some the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> that is    there is a point up to which it is profitable to cultivate and beyond which it is not profitable to cultivate <\s>
<s> the price of corn will not for any long time remain at a higher rate than is sufficient to cover with ordinary profit the cost of that portion of the general crop which is raised at greatest expense    188 for similar reasons the price will not remain at a lower rate <\s>
<s> if then the cost of production of grain is determined by that land which replaces the capital yields only the ordinary profit and pays no rent rent forms no part of this cost since that land does not and can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> mcleod 189 however says it is not the cost of production which regulates the value of agricultural produce but the value which regulates the cost <\s>
<s> definitions of value in use exchange value and price <\s>
<s> it is evident that of the two great departments of political economy the production of wealth and its distribution the consideration of value has to do with the latter alone and with that only so far as competition and not usage or custom is the distributing agency <\s>
<s> the use of a thing in political economy means its capacity to satisfy a desire or serve a purpose <\s>
<s> diamonds have this capacity in a high degree and unless they had it would not bear any price <\s>
<s> value in use or as mr <\s>
<s> de quincey calls it teleologic value is the extreme limit of value in exchange <\s>
<s> the exchange value of a thing may fall short to any amount of its value in use but that it can ever exceed the value in use implies a contradiction it supposes that persons will give to possess a thing more than the utmost value which they themselves put upon it as a means of gratifying their inclinations <\s>
<s> the word value when used without adjunct always means in political economy value in exchange <\s>
<s> exchange value requires to be distinguished from price <\s>
<s> writers have employed price to express the value of a thing in relation to moneythe quantity of money for which it will exchange <\s>
<s> moreover suppose that lands down to grade three paid rent when a took the farm now if the price of produce rises slightly grade four may pay something but possibly not enough to warrant any rent going to a landlord <\s>
<s> a will put capital on it for this return but certainly not until the price warrants it that is not until the price will return him at least the cost of working the land plus the profit on his outlay <\s>
<s> but the community needed this land or the price would not have gone up to the point which makes possible its cultivation even for a profit without rent <\s>
<s> there must always be somewhere some land affected in just this way <\s>
<s>    or to the capital employed in the least advantageous circumstances <\s>
<s> let us however suppose that there were a validity in this objection which can by no means be conceded to it that when the demand of the community had forced up food to such a price as would remunerate the expense of producing it from a certain quality of soil it happened nevertheless that all the soil of that quality was withheld from cultivation the increase of produce which the wants of society required would for the time be obtained wholly as it always is partially not by an extension of cultivation but by an increased application of labor and capital to land already cultivated <\s>
<s> now we have already seen that this increased application of capital other things being unaltered is always attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> the rise of price enables measures to be taken for increasing the produce which could not have been taken with profit at the previous price <\s>
<s> the farmer uses more expensive manures or manures land which he formerly left to nature or procures lime or marl from a distance as a dressing for the soil or pulverizes or weeds it more thoroughly or drains irrigates or subsoils portions of it which at former prices would not have paid the cost of the operation and so forth <\s>
<s> the farmer or improver will only consider whether the outlay he makes for the purpose will be returned to him with the ordinary profit and not whether any surplus will remain for rent <\s>
<s> even therefore if it were the fact that there is never any land taken into cultivation for which rent and that too of an amount worth taking into consideration was not paid it would be true nevertheless that there is always some agricultural capital which pays no rent because it returns nothing beyond the ordinary rate of profit this capital being the portion of capital last appliedthat to which the last addition to the produce was due or to express the essentials of the case in one phrase that which is applied in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> but the same amount of demand and the same price which enable this least productive portion of capital barely to replace itself with the ordinary profit enable every other portion to yield a surplus proportioned to the advantage it possesses <\s>
<s> and this surplus it is which competition enables the landlord to appropriate <\s>
<s> if land were all occupied and of only one grade the first installment of labor and capital produced we will say twenty bushels of wheat when the price of wheat rose and it became profitable to resort to greater expense on the soil a second installment of the same amount of labor and capital when applied however only yielded fifteen bushels more a third ten bushels more and a fourth five bushels more <\s>
<s> the soil now gives fifty bushels only under the highest pressure <\s>
<s> but if it was profitable to invest the same installment of labor and capital simply for the five bushels that at first had received a return of twenty bushels the price must have gone up so that five bushels should sell for as much as the twenty did formerly so mutatis mutandis of installments second and third <\s>
<s> so that if the demand is such as to require all of the fifty bushels the agricultural capital which produced the five bushels will be the standard according to which the rent of the capital which grew twenty fifteen and ten bushels respectively is measured <\s>
<s> the principle is exactly the same as if equal installments of capital and labor were invested on four different grades of land returning twenty fifteen ten and five bushels for each installment <\s>
<s> or as if in the table on page 240 a b c and d each represented different installments of the same amount of labor and capital put upon the same spot of ground instead of being as there put upon different grades of land <\s>
<s> the rent of all land is measured by the excess of the return to the whole capital employed on it above what is necessary to replace the capital with the ordinary rate of profit or in other words above what the same capital would yield if it were all employed in as disadvantageous circumstances as the least productive portion of it whether that least productive portion of capital is rendered so by being employed on the worst soil or by being expended in extorting more produce from land which already yielded as much as it could be made to part with on easier terms <\s>
<s> it will be true that the farmer requires the ordinary rate of profit on the whole of his capital that whatever it returns to him beyond this he is obliged to pay to the landlord but will not consent to pay more that there is a portion of capital applied to agriculture in such circumstances of productiveness as to yield only the ordinary profits and that the difference between the produce of this and of any other capital of similar amount is the measure of the tribute which that other capital can and will pay under the name of rent to the landlord <\s>
<s> this constitutes a law of rent as near the truth as such a law can possibly be though of course modified or disturbed in individual cases by pending contracts individual miscalculations the influence of habit and even the particular feelings and dispositions of the persons concerned <\s>
<s> the law of rent in the economic sense operates in the united states as truly as elsewhere although there is no separate class of landlords here <\s>
<s> with us almost all land is owned by the cultivator so that two functions those of the landlord and farmer are both united in one person <\s>
<s> although one payment is made it is still just as distinctly made up of two parts one of which is a payment to the owner for the superior quality of his soil and the other a payment to the same person if the owner is the cultivator of profit on the farmers working capital <\s>
<s> land which in the united states will only return enough to pay a profit on this capital can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> and land which can pay more than a profit on this working capital returns that excess as rent even if the farmer is also the owner and landlord <\s>
<s> the principle which regulates the amount of that excesswhich is the essential pointis the principle which determines the amount of economic rent and it holds true in the united states or finland provided only that different grades of land are called into cultivation <\s>
<s> the governing principle is the same no matter whether a payment is made to one man as profit and to another as rent or whether the two payments are made to the same man in two capacities <\s>
<s> it has been urged that the law of rent does not hold in the united states because    the price of grain and other agricultural produce has not risen in proportion to the increase of our numbers as it ought to have done if ricardos theory were true but has fallen since 1830 though since that time our population has been more than tripled    181 this overlooks the fact that we have not even yet taken up all our best agricultural lands so that for some products the law of diminishing productiveness has not yet shown itself <\s>
<s> the reason is that the extension of our railway system has only of late years brought the really good grain lands into cultivation <\s>
<s> the fact that there has been no rise in agricultural products is due to the enormous extent of marvelously fertile grain lands in the west and to the cheapness of transportation from those districts to the seaboard <\s>
<s> for a general understanding of the law of rent the following table will show how under constant increase of population represented by four different advances of population in the first column first the best and then the poorer lands are brought into cultivation <\s>
<s> we will suppose 1 that the most fertile land a at first pays no rent then 2 when more food is wanted than land a can supply it will be profitable to till land b but which as yet pays no rent <\s>
<s> but if eighteen bushels are a sufficient return to a given amount of labor and capital then when an equal amount of labor and capital engaged on a returns twenty four bushels six of that are beyond the ordinary profit and form the rent on land a and so on c will next be the line of comparison and then d; as the poorer soils are cultivated the rent of a increases population a b c d increase <\s>

<s> the rent of all land is measured by the excess of the return to the whole capital employed on it above what is necessary to replace the capital with the ordinary rate of profit or in other words above what the same capital would yield if it were all employed in as disadvantageous circumstances as the least productive portion of it whether that least productive portion of capital is rendered so by being employed on the worst soil or by being expended in extorting more produce from land which already yielded as much as it could be made to part with on easier terms <\s>
<s> it will be true that the farmer requires the ordinary rate of profit on the whole of his capital that whatever it returns to him beyond this he is obliged to pay to the landlord but will not consent to pay more that there is a portion of capital applied to agriculture in such circumstances of productiveness as to yield only the ordinary profits and that the difference between the produce of this and of any other capital of similar amount is the measure of the tribute which that other capital can and will pay under the name of rent to the landlord <\s>
<s> this constitutes a law of rent as near the truth as such a law can possibly be though of course modified or disturbed in individual cases by pending contracts individual miscalculations the influence of habit and even the particular feelings and dispositions of the persons concerned <\s>
<s> the law of rent in the economic sense operates in the united states as truly as elsewhere although there is no separate class of landlords here <\s>
<s> with us almost all land is owned by the cultivator so that two functions those of the landlord and farmer are both united in one person <\s>
<s> although one payment is made it is still just as distinctly made up of two parts one of which is a payment to the owner for the superior quality of his soil and the other a payment to the same person if the owner is the cultivator of profit on the farmers working capital <\s>
<s> land which in the united states will only return enough to pay a profit on this capital can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> and land which can pay more than a profit on this working capital returns that excess as rent even if the farmer is also the owner and landlord <\s>
<s> the principle which regulates the amount of that excesswhich is the essential pointis the principle which determines the amount of economic rent and it holds true in the united states or finland provided only that different grades of land are called into cultivation <\s>
<s> the governing principle is the same no matter whether a payment is made to one man as profit and to another as rent or whether the two payments are made to the same man in two capacities <\s>
<s> it has been urged that the law of rent does not hold in the united states because    the price of grain and other agricultural produce has not risen in proportion to the increase of our numbers as it ought to have done if ricardos theory were true but has fallen since 1830 though since that time our population has been more than tripled    181 this overlooks the fact that we have not even yet taken up all our best agricultural lands so that for some products the law of diminishing productiveness has not yet shown itself <\s>
<s> the reason is that the extension of our railway system has only of late years brought the really good grain lands into cultivation <\s>
<s> the fact that there has been no rise in agricultural products is due to the enormous extent of marvelously fertile grain lands in the west and to the cheapness of transportation from those districts to the seaboard <\s>
<s> for a general understanding of the law of rent the following table will show how under constant increase of population represented by four different advances of population in the first column first the best and then the poorer lands are brought into cultivation <\s>

<s> opposing views of the law of rent <\s>
<s> under the name of rent many payments are commonly included which are not a remuneration for the original powers of the land itself but for capital expended on it <\s>
<s> the buildings are as distinct a thing from the farm as the stock or the timber on it and what is paid for them can no more be called rent of land than a payment for cattle would be if it were the custom that the landlord should stock the farm for the tenant <\s>
<s> the buildings like the cattle are not land but capital regularly consumed and reproduced and all payments made in consideration for them are properly interest <\s>
<s> but with regard to capital actually sunk in improvements and not requiring periodical renewal but spent once for all in giving the land a permanent increase of productiveness it appears to me that the return made to such capital loses altogether the character of profits and is governed by the principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is true that a landlord will not expend capital in improving his estate unless he expects from the improvement an increase of income surpassing the interest of his outlay <\s>
<s> prospectively this increase of income may be regarded as profit but when the expense has been incurred and the improvement made the rent of the improved land is governed by the same rules as that of the unimproved <\s>
<s> carey as well as bastiat has declared that there is a law of increasing returns from land <\s>
<s> he points out that everything now existing could be reproduced to day at a less cost than that involved in its original production owing to our advance in skill knowledge and all the arts of production that for example it costs less to make an axe now than it did five hundred years ago so also with a farm since a farm of a given amount of productiveness can be brought into cultivation at less cost to day than that originally spent upon it <\s>
<s> the gain of society has we all admit been such that we produce almost everything at a less cost now than long ago but to class a farm and an axe together overlooks in the most remarkable way the fact that land can not be created by labor and capital while axes can and that too indefinitely <\s>
<s> nor can the produce from the land be increased indefinitely at a diminishing cost <\s>
<s> this is sometimes denied by the appeal to facts    it can be abundantly proved that if we take any two periods sufficiently distant to afford a fair test whether fifty or one hundred or five hundred years the production of the land relatively to the labor employed upon it has progressively become greater and greater    182 but this does not prove that an existing tendency to diminishing returns has not been more than offset by the progress of the arts and improvements <\s>
<s>    the advance of a ship against wind and tide is no proof that there is no wind and tide    in a work entitled    the past the present and the future    mr <\s>
<s> carey takes a ground of objection to the ricardo theory of rent namely that in point of historical fact the lands first brought under cultivation are not the most fertile but the barren lands <\s>
<s>    we find the settler invariably occupying the high and thin lands requiring little clearing and no drainage <\s>
<s> with the growth of population and wealth other soils yielding a larger return to labor are always brought into activity with a constantly increasing return to the labor expended upon them    in whatever order the lands come into cultivation those which when cultivated yield the least return in proportion to the labor required for their culture will always regulate the price of agricultural produce and all other lands will pay a rent simply equivalent to the excess of their produce over this minimum <\s>
<s> whatever unguarded expressions may have been occasionally used in describing the law of rent these two propositions are all that was ever intended by it <\s>
<s> carey could show that the return to labor from the land agricultural skill and science being supposed the same is not a diminishing return he would overthrow a principle much more fundamental than any law of rent <\s>
<s> but in this he has wholly failed <\s>
<s> another objection taken against the law of diminishing returns and so against the law of rent is that the potential increase of food e g of a grain of wheat is far greater than that of man 183 no one disputes the fact that one grain of wheat can reproduce itself more times than man and that too in a geometric increase but not without land <\s>
<s> a grain of wheat needs land in which it can multiply itself and this necessary element of its increase is limited and it is the very thing which limits the multiplication of the grains of wheat <\s>
<s> on the same piece of land one can not get more than what comes from one act of reproduction in the grain <\s>
<s> if one grain produces 100 of its kind doubling the capital will not repeatedly cause a geometric increase in the ratio of reproduction of each grain on this same land so that one grain by one process produces of its kind 200 400 800 or 1,600 because you can not multiply the land in any such ratio as would accompany this potential reduplication of the grain <\s>
<s> this objection would not seem worth answering were it not that it furnishes some difficulty to really honest inquirers <\s>
<s> others again allege as an objection against ricardo that if all land were of equal fertility it might still yield a rent <\s>
<s> but ricardo says precisely the same <\s>
<s> it is also distinctly a portion of ricardos doctrine that even apart from differences of situation the land of a country supposed to be of uniform fertility would all of it on a certain supposition pay rent namely if the demand of the community required that it should all be cultivated and cultivated beyond the point at which a further application of capital begins to be attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> this is simply the question before discussed whether if only one class of land were cultivated some agricultural capital would pay rent or not <\s>
<s> it all depends on the fact whether populationand so the demand for foodhas increased to the point where it calls out a recognition of the diminishing productiveness of the soil <\s>
<s> in that case different capitals would be invested so that there would be different returns to the same amount of capital and the prior or more advantageous investments of capital on the land would yield more than the ordinary rate of profit which could be claimed as rent <\s>
<s> perry 184 admits the law of diminishing returns but holds that    as land is capital and as every form of capital may be loaned or rented and thus become fruitful in the hands of another the rent of land does not differ essentially in its nature from the rent of buildings in cities or from the interest of money    henry george admits ricardos law of rent to its full extent but very curiously says    irrespective of the increase of population the effect of improvements in methods of production and exchange is to increase rent .... <\s>
<s> the effect of labor saving improvements will be to increase the production of wealth <\s>
<s> now for the production of wealth two things are required labor and land <\s>
<s> therefore the effect of labor saving improvements will be to extend the demand for land and wherever the limit of the quality of land in use is reached to bring into cultivation lands of less natural productiveness or to extend cultivation on the same lands to a point of lower natural productiveness <\s>
<s> and thus while the primary effect of labor saving improvements is to increase the power of labor the secondary effect is to extend cultivation and where this lowers the margin of cultivation to increase rent    185 francis bowen 186 rejects ricardos law and says    rent depends not on the increase but on the distribution of the populationasserting that the existence of large cities and towns determines the amount of rent paid by neighboring land 187   6 <\s>
<s> rent does not enter into the cost of production of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent does not really form any part of the expenses of agricultural production or of the advances of the capitalist <\s>
<s> the grounds on which this assertion was made are now apparent <\s>
<s> it is true that all tenant farmers and many other classes of producers pay rent <\s>
<s> but we have now seen that whoever cultivates land paying a rent for it gets in return for his rent an instrument of superior power to other instruments of the same kind for which no rent is paid <\s>
<s> the superiority of the instrument is in exact proportion to the rent paid for it <\s>
<s> if a few persons had steam engines of superior power to all others in existence but limited by physical laws to a number short of the demand the rent which a manufacturer would be willing to pay for one of these steam engines could not be looked upon as an addition to his outlay because by the use of it he would save in his other expenses the equivalent of what it cost him without it he could not do the same quantity of work unless at an additional expense equal to the rent <\s>
<s> the same thing is true of land <\s>
<s> the real expenses of production are those incurred on the worst land or by the capital employed in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> this land or capital pays as we have seen no rent but the expenses to which it is subject cause all other land or agricultural capital to be subjected to an equivalent expense in the form of rent <\s>
<s> whoever does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantages and the rent which he pays does not place him in a worse position than but only in the same position as his fellow producer who pays no rent but whose instrument is one of inferior efficiency <\s>
<s> soils are of every grade some which if cultivated might replace the capital but give no profit some give a slight but not an ordinary profit some the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> that is    there is a point up to which it is profitable to cultivate and beyond which it is not profitable to cultivate <\s>
<s> the price of corn will not for any long time remain at a higher rate than is sufficient to cover with ordinary profit the cost of that portion of the general crop which is raised at greatest expense    188 for similar reasons the price will not remain at a lower rate <\s>
<s> if then the cost of production of grain is determined by that land which replaces the capital yields only the ordinary profit and pays no rent rent forms no part of this cost since that land does not and can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> mcleod 189 however says it is not the cost of production which regulates the value of agricultural produce but the value which regulates the cost <\s>
<s> definitions of value in use exchange value and price <\s>
<s> it is evident that of the two great departments of political economy the production of wealth and its distribution the consideration of value has to do with the latter alone and with that only so far as competition and not usage or custom is the distributing agency <\s>
<s> the use of a thing in political economy means its capacity to satisfy a desire or serve a purpose <\s>
<s> diamonds have this capacity in a high degree and unless they had it would not bear any price <\s>
<s> value in use or as mr <\s>
<s> de quincey calls it teleologic value is the extreme limit of value in exchange <\s>
<s> the exchange value of a thing may fall short to any amount of its value in use but that it can ever exceed the value in use implies a contradiction it supposes that persons will give to possess a thing more than the utmost value which they themselves put upon it as a means of gratifying their inclinations <\s>
<s> the word value when used without adjunct always means in political economy value in exchange <\s>
<s> exchange value requires to be distinguished from price <\s>
<s> writers have employed price to express the value of a thing in relation to moneythe quantity of money for which it will exchange <\s>
<s> moreover suppose that lands down to grade three paid rent when a took the farm now if the price of produce rises slightly grade four may pay something but possibly not enough to warrant any rent going to a landlord <\s>
<s> a will put capital on it for this return but certainly not until the price warrants it that is not until the price will return him at least the cost of working the land plus the profit on his outlay <\s>
<s> but the community needed this land or the price would not have gone up to the point which makes possible its cultivation even for a profit without rent <\s>
<s> there must always be somewhere some land affected in just this way <\s>
<s>    or to the capital employed in the least advantageous circumstances <\s>
<s> let us however suppose that there were a validity in this objection which can by no means be conceded to it that when the demand of the community had forced up food to such a price as would remunerate the expense of producing it from a certain quality of soil it happened nevertheless that all the soil of that quality was withheld from cultivation the increase of produce which the wants of society required would for the time be obtained wholly as it always is partially not by an extension of cultivation but by an increased application of labor and capital to land already cultivated <\s>
<s> now we have already seen that this increased application of capital other things being unaltered is always attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> the rise of price enables measures to be taken for increasing the produce which could not have been taken with profit at the previous price <\s>
<s> the farmer uses more expensive manures or manures land which he formerly left to nature or procures lime or marl from a distance as a dressing for the soil or pulverizes or weeds it more thoroughly or drains irrigates or subsoils portions of it which at former prices would not have paid the cost of the operation and so forth <\s>
<s> the farmer or improver will only consider whether the outlay he makes for the purpose will be returned to him with the ordinary profit and not whether any surplus will remain for rent <\s>
<s> even therefore if it were the fact that there is never any land taken into cultivation for which rent and that too of an amount worth taking into consideration was not paid it would be true nevertheless that there is always some agricultural capital which pays no rent because it returns nothing beyond the ordinary rate of profit this capital being the portion of capital last appliedthat to which the last addition to the produce was due or to express the essentials of the case in one phrase that which is applied in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> but the same amount of demand and the same price which enable this least productive portion of capital barely to replace itself with the ordinary profit enable every other portion to yield a surplus proportioned to the advantage it possesses <\s>
<s> and this surplus it is which competition enables the landlord to appropriate <\s>
<s> if land were all occupied and of only one grade the first installment of labor and capital produced we will say twenty bushels of wheat when the price of wheat rose and it became profitable to resort to greater expense on the soil a second installment of the same amount of labor and capital when applied however only yielded fifteen bushels more a third ten bushels more and a fourth five bushels more <\s>
<s> the soil now gives fifty bushels only under the highest pressure <\s>
<s> but if it was profitable to invest the same installment of labor and capital simply for the five bushels that at first had received a return of twenty bushels the price must have gone up so that five bushels should sell for as much as the twenty did formerly so mutatis mutandis of installments second and third <\s>
<s> so that if the demand is such as to require all of the fifty bushels the agricultural capital which produced the five bushels will be the standard according to which the rent of the capital which grew twenty fifteen and ten bushels respectively is measured <\s>
<s> the principle is exactly the same as if equal installments of capital and labor were invested on four different grades of land returning twenty fifteen ten and five bushels for each installment <\s>
<s> or as if in the table on page 240 a b c and d each represented different installments of the same amount of labor and capital put upon the same spot of ground instead of being as there put upon different grades of land <\s>
<s> the rent of all land is measured by the excess of the return to the whole capital employed on it above what is necessary to replace the capital with the ordinary rate of profit or in other words above what the same capital would yield if it were all employed in as disadvantageous circumstances as the least productive portion of it whether that least productive portion of capital is rendered so by being employed on the worst soil or by being expended in extorting more produce from land which already yielded as much as it could be made to part with on easier terms <\s>

<s> the exchange value of a thing may fall short to any amount of its value in use but that it can ever exceed the value in use implies a contradiction it supposes that persons will give to possess a thing more than the utmost value which they themselves put upon it as a means of gratifying their inclinations <\s>
<s> the word value when used without adjunct always means in political economy value in exchange <\s>
<s> exchange value requires to be distinguished from price <\s>
<s> writers have employed price to express the value of a thing in relation to moneythe quantity of money for which it will exchange <\s>
<s> moreover suppose that lands down to grade three paid rent when a took the farm now if the price of produce rises slightly grade four may pay something but possibly not enough to warrant any rent going to a landlord <\s>
<s> a will put capital on it for this return but certainly not until the price warrants it that is not until the price will return him at least the cost of working the land plus the profit on his outlay <\s>
<s> but the community needed this land or the price would not have gone up to the point which makes possible its cultivation even for a profit without rent <\s>
<s> there must always be somewhere some land affected in just this way <\s>
<s>    or to the capital employed in the least advantageous circumstances <\s>
<s> let us however suppose that there were a validity in this objection which can by no means be conceded to it that when the demand of the community had forced up food to such a price as would remunerate the expense of producing it from a certain quality of soil it happened nevertheless that all the soil of that quality was withheld from cultivation the increase of produce which the wants of society required would for the time be obtained wholly as it always is partially not by an extension of cultivation but by an increased application of labor and capital to land already cultivated <\s>
<s> now we have already seen that this increased application of capital other things being unaltered is always attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> the rise of price enables measures to be taken for increasing the produce which could not have been taken with profit at the previous price <\s>
<s> the farmer uses more expensive manures or manures land which he formerly left to nature or procures lime or marl from a distance as a dressing for the soil or pulverizes or weeds it more thoroughly or drains irrigates or subsoils portions of it which at former prices would not have paid the cost of the operation and so forth <\s>
<s> the farmer or improver will only consider whether the outlay he makes for the purpose will be returned to him with the ordinary profit and not whether any surplus will remain for rent <\s>
<s> even therefore if it were the fact that there is never any land taken into cultivation for which rent and that too of an amount worth taking into consideration was not paid it would be true nevertheless that there is always some agricultural capital which pays no rent because it returns nothing beyond the ordinary rate of profit this capital being the portion of capital last appliedthat to which the last addition to the produce was due or to express the essentials of the case in one phrase that which is applied in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> but the same amount of demand and the same price which enable this least productive portion of capital barely to replace itself with the ordinary profit enable every other portion to yield a surplus proportioned to the advantage it possesses <\s>
<s> and this surplus it is which competition enables the landlord to appropriate <\s>
<s> if land were all occupied and of only one grade the first installment of labor and capital produced we will say twenty bushels of wheat when the price of wheat rose and it became profitable to resort to greater expense on the soil a second installment of the same amount of labor and capital when applied however only yielded fifteen bushels more a third ten bushels more and a fourth five bushels more <\s>
<s> the soil now gives fifty bushels only under the highest pressure <\s>
<s> but if it was profitable to invest the same installment of labor and capital simply for the five bushels that at first had received a return of twenty bushels the price must have gone up so that five bushels should sell for as much as the twenty did formerly so mutatis mutandis of installments second and third <\s>
<s> so that if the demand is such as to require all of the fifty bushels the agricultural capital which produced the five bushels will be the standard according to which the rent of the capital which grew twenty fifteen and ten bushels respectively is measured <\s>
<s> the principle is exactly the same as if equal installments of capital and labor were invested on four different grades of land returning twenty fifteen ten and five bushels for each installment <\s>
<s> or as if in the table on page 240 a b c and d each represented different installments of the same amount of labor and capital put upon the same spot of ground instead of being as there put upon different grades of land <\s>
<s> the rent of all land is measured by the excess of the return to the whole capital employed on it above what is necessary to replace the capital with the ordinary rate of profit or in other words above what the same capital would yield if it were all employed in as disadvantageous circumstances as the least productive portion of it whether that least productive portion of capital is rendered so by being employed on the worst soil or by being expended in extorting more produce from land which already yielded as much as it could be made to part with on easier terms <\s>
<s> it will be true that the farmer requires the ordinary rate of profit on the whole of his capital that whatever it returns to him beyond this he is obliged to pay to the landlord but will not consent to pay more that there is a portion of capital applied to agriculture in such circumstances of productiveness as to yield only the ordinary profits and that the difference between the produce of this and of any other capital of similar amount is the measure of the tribute which that other capital can and will pay under the name of rent to the landlord <\s>
<s> this constitutes a law of rent as near the truth as such a law can possibly be though of course modified or disturbed in individual cases by pending contracts individual miscalculations the influence of habit and even the particular feelings and dispositions of the persons concerned <\s>
<s> the law of rent in the economic sense operates in the united states as truly as elsewhere although there is no separate class of landlords here <\s>
<s> with us almost all land is owned by the cultivator so that two functions those of the landlord and farmer are both united in one person <\s>
<s> although one payment is made it is still just as distinctly made up of two parts one of which is a payment to the owner for the superior quality of his soil and the other a payment to the same person if the owner is the cultivator of profit on the farmers working capital <\s>
<s> land which in the united states will only return enough to pay a profit on this capital can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> and land which can pay more than a profit on this working capital returns that excess as rent even if the farmer is also the owner and landlord <\s>
<s> the principle which regulates the amount of that excesswhich is the essential pointis the principle which determines the amount of economic rent and it holds true in the united states or finland provided only that different grades of land are called into cultivation <\s>
<s> the governing principle is the same no matter whether a payment is made to one man as profit and to another as rent or whether the two payments are made to the same man in two capacities <\s>
<s> it has been urged that the law of rent does not hold in the united states because    the price of grain and other agricultural produce has not risen in proportion to the increase of our numbers as it ought to have done if ricardos theory were true but has fallen since 1830 though since that time our population has been more than tripled    181 this overlooks the fact that we have not even yet taken up all our best agricultural lands so that for some products the law of diminishing productiveness has not yet shown itself <\s>
<s> the reason is that the extension of our railway system has only of late years brought the really good grain lands into cultivation <\s>
<s> the fact that there has been no rise in agricultural products is due to the enormous extent of marvelously fertile grain lands in the west and to the cheapness of transportation from those districts to the seaboard <\s>
<s> for a general understanding of the law of rent the following table will show how under constant increase of population represented by four different advances of population in the first column first the best and then the poorer lands are brought into cultivation <\s>
<s> we will suppose 1 that the most fertile land a at first pays no rent then 2 when more food is wanted than land a can supply it will be profitable to till land b but which as yet pays no rent <\s>

<s> opposing views of the law of rent <\s>
<s> under the name of rent many payments are commonly included which are not a remuneration for the original powers of the land itself but for capital expended on it <\s>
<s> the buildings are as distinct a thing from the farm as the stock or the timber on it and what is paid for them can no more be called rent of land than a payment for cattle would be if it were the custom that the landlord should stock the farm for the tenant <\s>
<s> the buildings like the cattle are not land but capital regularly consumed and reproduced and all payments made in consideration for them are properly interest <\s>
<s> but with regard to capital actually sunk in improvements and not requiring periodical renewal but spent once for all in giving the land a permanent increase of productiveness it appears to me that the return made to such capital loses altogether the character of profits and is governed by the principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is true that a landlord will not expend capital in improving his estate unless he expects from the improvement an increase of income surpassing the interest of his outlay <\s>
<s> prospectively this increase of income may be regarded as profit but when the expense has been incurred and the improvement made the rent of the improved land is governed by the same rules as that of the unimproved <\s>
<s> carey as well as bastiat has declared that there is a law of increasing returns from land <\s>
<s> he points out that everything now existing could be reproduced to day at a less cost than that involved in its original production owing to our advance in skill knowledge and all the arts of production that for example it costs less to make an axe now than it did five hundred years ago so also with a farm since a farm of a given amount of productiveness can be brought into cultivation at less cost to day than that originally spent upon it <\s>
<s> the gain of society has we all admit been such that we produce almost everything at a less cost now than long ago but to class a farm and an axe together overlooks in the most remarkable way the fact that land can not be created by labor and capital while axes can and that too indefinitely <\s>
<s> nor can the produce from the land be increased indefinitely at a diminishing cost <\s>
<s> this is sometimes denied by the appeal to facts    it can be abundantly proved that if we take any two periods sufficiently distant to afford a fair test whether fifty or one hundred or five hundred years the production of the land relatively to the labor employed upon it has progressively become greater and greater    182 but this does not prove that an existing tendency to diminishing returns has not been more than offset by the progress of the arts and improvements <\s>
<s>    the advance of a ship against wind and tide is no proof that there is no wind and tide    in a work entitled    the past the present and the future    mr <\s>
<s> carey takes a ground of objection to the ricardo theory of rent namely that in point of historical fact the lands first brought under cultivation are not the most fertile but the barren lands <\s>
<s>    we find the settler invariably occupying the high and thin lands requiring little clearing and no drainage <\s>
<s> with the growth of population and wealth other soils yielding a larger return to labor are always brought into activity with a constantly increasing return to the labor expended upon them    in whatever order the lands come into cultivation those which when cultivated yield the least return in proportion to the labor required for their culture will always regulate the price of agricultural produce and all other lands will pay a rent simply equivalent to the excess of their produce over this minimum <\s>
<s> whatever unguarded expressions may have been occasionally used in describing the law of rent these two propositions are all that was ever intended by it <\s>
<s> carey could show that the return to labor from the land agricultural skill and science being supposed the same is not a diminishing return he would overthrow a principle much more fundamental than any law of rent <\s>
<s> but in this he has wholly failed <\s>
<s> another objection taken against the law of diminishing returns and so against the law of rent is that the potential increase of food e g of a grain of wheat is far greater than that of man 183 no one disputes the fact that one grain of wheat can reproduce itself more times than man and that too in a geometric increase but not without land <\s>
<s> a grain of wheat needs land in which it can multiply itself and this necessary element of its increase is limited and it is the very thing which limits the multiplication of the grains of wheat <\s>
<s> on the same piece of land one can not get more than what comes from one act of reproduction in the grain <\s>
<s> if one grain produces 100 of its kind doubling the capital will not repeatedly cause a geometric increase in the ratio of reproduction of each grain on this same land so that one grain by one process produces of its kind 200 400 800 or 1,600 because you can not multiply the land in any such ratio as would accompany this potential reduplication of the grain <\s>
<s> this objection would not seem worth answering were it not that it furnishes some difficulty to really honest inquirers <\s>
<s> others again allege as an objection against ricardo that if all land were of equal fertility it might still yield a rent <\s>
<s> but ricardo says precisely the same <\s>
<s> it is also distinctly a portion of ricardos doctrine that even apart from differences of situation the land of a country supposed to be of uniform fertility would all of it on a certain supposition pay rent namely if the demand of the community required that it should all be cultivated and cultivated beyond the point at which a further application of capital begins to be attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> this is simply the question before discussed whether if only one class of land were cultivated some agricultural capital would pay rent or not <\s>
<s> it all depends on the fact whether populationand so the demand for foodhas increased to the point where it calls out a recognition of the diminishing productiveness of the soil <\s>
<s> in that case different capitals would be invested so that there would be different returns to the same amount of capital and the prior or more advantageous investments of capital on the land would yield more than the ordinary rate of profit which could be claimed as rent <\s>
<s> perry 184 admits the law of diminishing returns but holds that    as land is capital and as every form of capital may be loaned or rented and thus become fruitful in the hands of another the rent of land does not differ essentially in its nature from the rent of buildings in cities or from the interest of money    henry george admits ricardos law of rent to its full extent but very curiously says    irrespective of the increase of population the effect of improvements in methods of production and exchange is to increase rent .... <\s>
<s> the effect of labor saving improvements will be to increase the production of wealth <\s>
<s> now for the production of wealth two things are required labor and land <\s>
<s> therefore the effect of labor saving improvements will be to extend the demand for land and wherever the limit of the quality of land in use is reached to bring into cultivation lands of less natural productiveness or to extend cultivation on the same lands to a point of lower natural productiveness <\s>
<s> and thus while the primary effect of labor saving improvements is to increase the power of labor the secondary effect is to extend cultivation and where this lowers the margin of cultivation to increase rent    185 francis bowen 186 rejects ricardos law and says    rent depends not on the increase but on the distribution of the populationasserting that the existence of large cities and towns determines the amount of rent paid by neighboring land 187   6 <\s>
<s> rent does not enter into the cost of production of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent does not really form any part of the expenses of agricultural production or of the advances of the capitalist <\s>
<s> the grounds on which this assertion was made are now apparent <\s>
<s> it is true that all tenant farmers and many other classes of producers pay rent <\s>
<s> but we have now seen that whoever cultivates land paying a rent for it gets in return for his rent an instrument of superior power to other instruments of the same kind for which no rent is paid <\s>
<s> the superiority of the instrument is in exact proportion to the rent paid for it <\s>
<s> if a few persons had steam engines of superior power to all others in existence but limited by physical laws to a number short of the demand the rent which a manufacturer would be willing to pay for one of these steam engines could not be looked upon as an addition to his outlay because by the use of it he would save in his other expenses the equivalent of what it cost him without it he could not do the same quantity of work unless at an additional expense equal to the rent <\s>
<s> the same thing is true of land <\s>
<s> the real expenses of production are those incurred on the worst land or by the capital employed in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> this land or capital pays as we have seen no rent but the expenses to which it is subject cause all other land or agricultural capital to be subjected to an equivalent expense in the form of rent <\s>
<s> whoever does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantages and the rent which he pays does not place him in a worse position than but only in the same position as his fellow producer who pays no rent but whose instrument is one of inferior efficiency <\s>
<s> soils are of every grade some which if cultivated might replace the capital but give no profit some give a slight but not an ordinary profit some the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> that is    there is a point up to which it is profitable to cultivate and beyond which it is not profitable to cultivate <\s>
<s> the price of corn will not for any long time remain at a higher rate than is sufficient to cover with ordinary profit the cost of that portion of the general crop which is raised at greatest expense    188 for similar reasons the price will not remain at a lower rate <\s>
<s> if then the cost of production of grain is determined by that land which replaces the capital yields only the ordinary profit and pays no rent rent forms no part of this cost since that land does not and can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> mcleod 189 however says it is not the cost of production which regulates the value of agricultural produce but the value which regulates the cost <\s>
<s> definitions of value in use exchange value and price <\s>
<s> it is evident that of the two great departments of political economy the production of wealth and its distribution the consideration of value has to do with the latter alone and with that only so far as competition and not usage or custom is the distributing agency <\s>

<s> the effect of labor saving improvements will be to increase the production of wealth <\s>
<s> now for the production of wealth two things are required labor and land <\s>

<s> rent does not enter into the cost of production of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent does not really form any part of the expenses of agricultural production or of the advances of the capitalist <\s>
<s> the grounds on which this assertion was made are now apparent <\s>
<s> it is true that all tenant farmers and many other classes of producers pay rent <\s>
<s> but we have now seen that whoever cultivates land paying a rent for it gets in return for his rent an instrument of superior power to other instruments of the same kind for which no rent is paid <\s>
<s> the superiority of the instrument is in exact proportion to the rent paid for it <\s>
<s> if a few persons had steam engines of superior power to all others in existence but limited by physical laws to a number short of the demand the rent which a manufacturer would be willing to pay for one of these steam engines could not be looked upon as an addition to his outlay because by the use of it he would save in his other expenses the equivalent of what it cost him without it he could not do the same quantity of work unless at an additional expense equal to the rent <\s>
<s> the same thing is true of land <\s>
<s> the real expenses of production are those incurred on the worst land or by the capital employed in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> this land or capital pays as we have seen no rent but the expenses to which it is subject cause all other land or agricultural capital to be subjected to an equivalent expense in the form of rent <\s>
<s> whoever does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantages and the rent which he pays does not place him in a worse position than but only in the same position as his fellow producer who pays no rent but whose instrument is one of inferior efficiency <\s>
<s> soils are of every grade some which if cultivated might replace the capital but give no profit some give a slight but not an ordinary profit some the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> that is    there is a point up to which it is profitable to cultivate and beyond which it is not profitable to cultivate <\s>
<s> the price of corn will not for any long time remain at a higher rate than is sufficient to cover with ordinary profit the cost of that portion of the general crop which is raised at greatest expense    188 for similar reasons the price will not remain at a lower rate <\s>
<s> if then the cost of production of grain is determined by that land which replaces the capital yields only the ordinary profit and pays no rent rent forms no part of this cost since that land does not and can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> mcleod 189 however says it is not the cost of production which regulates the value of agricultural produce but the value which regulates the cost <\s>
<s> definitions of value in use exchange value and price <\s>
<s> it is evident that of the two great departments of political economy the production of wealth and its distribution the consideration of value has to do with the latter alone and with that only so far as competition and not usage or custom is the distributing agency <\s>

<s> the word value when used without adjunct always means in political economy value in exchange <\s>
<s> exchange value requires to be distinguished from price <\s>
<s> writers have employed price to express the value of a thing in relation to moneythe quantity of money for which it will exchange <\s>
<s> moreover suppose that lands down to grade three paid rent when a took the farm now if the price of produce rises slightly grade four may pay something but possibly not enough to warrant any rent going to a landlord <\s>
<s> a will put capital on it for this return but certainly not until the price warrants it that is not until the price will return him at least the cost of working the land plus the profit on his outlay <\s>
<s> but the community needed this land or the price would not have gone up to the point which makes possible its cultivation even for a profit without rent <\s>
<s> there must always be somewhere some land affected in just this way <\s>
<s>    or to the capital employed in the least advantageous circumstances <\s>
<s> let us however suppose that there were a validity in this objection which can by no means be conceded to it that when the demand of the community had forced up food to such a price as would remunerate the expense of producing it from a certain quality of soil it happened nevertheless that all the soil of that quality was withheld from cultivation the increase of produce which the wants of society required would for the time be obtained wholly as it always is partially not by an extension of cultivation but by an increased application of labor and capital to land already cultivated <\s>
<s> now we have already seen that this increased application of capital other things being unaltered is always attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> the rise of price enables measures to be taken for increasing the produce which could not have been taken with profit at the previous price <\s>
<s> the farmer uses more expensive manures or manures land which he formerly left to nature or procures lime or marl from a distance as a dressing for the soil or pulverizes or weeds it more thoroughly or drains irrigates or subsoils portions of it which at former prices would not have paid the cost of the operation and so forth <\s>
<s> the farmer or improver will only consider whether the outlay he makes for the purpose will be returned to him with the ordinary profit and not whether any surplus will remain for rent <\s>
<s> even therefore if it were the fact that there is never any land taken into cultivation for which rent and that too of an amount worth taking into consideration was not paid it would be true nevertheless that there is always some agricultural capital which pays no rent because it returns nothing beyond the ordinary rate of profit this capital being the portion of capital last appliedthat to which the last addition to the produce was due or to express the essentials of the case in one phrase that which is applied in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> but the same amount of demand and the same price which enable this least productive portion of capital barely to replace itself with the ordinary profit enable every other portion to yield a surplus proportioned to the advantage it possesses <\s>
<s> and this surplus it is which competition enables the landlord to appropriate <\s>
<s> if land were all occupied and of only one grade the first installment of labor and capital produced we will say twenty bushels of wheat when the price of wheat rose and it became profitable to resort to greater expense on the soil a second installment of the same amount of labor and capital when applied however only yielded fifteen bushels more a third ten bushels more and a fourth five bushels more <\s>
<s> the soil now gives fifty bushels only under the highest pressure <\s>
<s> but if it was profitable to invest the same installment of labor and capital simply for the five bushels that at first had received a return of twenty bushels the price must have gone up so that five bushels should sell for as much as the twenty did formerly so mutatis mutandis of installments second and third <\s>
<s> so that if the demand is such as to require all of the fifty bushels the agricultural capital which produced the five bushels will be the standard according to which the rent of the capital which grew twenty fifteen and ten bushels respectively is measured <\s>
<s> the principle is exactly the same as if equal installments of capital and labor were invested on four different grades of land returning twenty fifteen ten and five bushels for each installment <\s>
<s> or as if in the table on page 240 a b c and d each represented different installments of the same amount of labor and capital put upon the same spot of ground instead of being as there put upon different grades of land <\s>
<s> the rent of all land is measured by the excess of the return to the whole capital employed on it above what is necessary to replace the capital with the ordinary rate of profit or in other words above what the same capital would yield if it were all employed in as disadvantageous circumstances as the least productive portion of it whether that least productive portion of capital is rendered so by being employed on the worst soil or by being expended in extorting more produce from land which already yielded as much as it could be made to part with on easier terms <\s>
<s> it will be true that the farmer requires the ordinary rate of profit on the whole of his capital that whatever it returns to him beyond this he is obliged to pay to the landlord but will not consent to pay more that there is a portion of capital applied to agriculture in such circumstances of productiveness as to yield only the ordinary profits and that the difference between the produce of this and of any other capital of similar amount is the measure of the tribute which that other capital can and will pay under the name of rent to the landlord <\s>
<s> this constitutes a law of rent as near the truth as such a law can possibly be though of course modified or disturbed in individual cases by pending contracts individual miscalculations the influence of habit and even the particular feelings and dispositions of the persons concerned <\s>
<s> the law of rent in the economic sense operates in the united states as truly as elsewhere although there is no separate class of landlords here <\s>
<s> with us almost all land is owned by the cultivator so that two functions those of the landlord and farmer are both united in one person <\s>
<s> although one payment is made it is still just as distinctly made up of two parts one of which is a payment to the owner for the superior quality of his soil and the other a payment to the same person if the owner is the cultivator of profit on the farmers working capital <\s>
<s> land which in the united states will only return enough to pay a profit on this capital can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> and land which can pay more than a profit on this working capital returns that excess as rent even if the farmer is also the owner and landlord <\s>
<s> the principle which regulates the amount of that excesswhich is the essential pointis the principle which determines the amount of economic rent and it holds true in the united states or finland provided only that different grades of land are called into cultivation <\s>
<s> the governing principle is the same no matter whether a payment is made to one man as profit and to another as rent or whether the two payments are made to the same man in two capacities <\s>
<s> it has been urged that the law of rent does not hold in the united states because    the price of grain and other agricultural produce has not risen in proportion to the increase of our numbers as it ought to have done if ricardos theory were true but has fallen since 1830 though since that time our population has been more than tripled    181 this overlooks the fact that we have not even yet taken up all our best agricultural lands so that for some products the law of diminishing productiveness has not yet shown itself <\s>
<s> the reason is that the extension of our railway system has only of late years brought the really good grain lands into cultivation <\s>
<s> the fact that there has been no rise in agricultural products is due to the enormous extent of marvelously fertile grain lands in the west and to the cheapness of transportation from those districts to the seaboard <\s>

<s> opposing views of the law of rent <\s>
<s> under the name of rent many payments are commonly included which are not a remuneration for the original powers of the land itself but for capital expended on it <\s>
<s> the buildings are as distinct a thing from the farm as the stock or the timber on it and what is paid for them can no more be called rent of land than a payment for cattle would be if it were the custom that the landlord should stock the farm for the tenant <\s>
<s> the buildings like the cattle are not land but capital regularly consumed and reproduced and all payments made in consideration for them are properly interest <\s>
<s> but with regard to capital actually sunk in improvements and not requiring periodical renewal but spent once for all in giving the land a permanent increase of productiveness it appears to me that the return made to such capital loses altogether the character of profits and is governed by the principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is true that a landlord will not expend capital in improving his estate unless he expects from the improvement an increase of income surpassing the interest of his outlay <\s>
<s> prospectively this increase of income may be regarded as profit but when the expense has been incurred and the improvement made the rent of the improved land is governed by the same rules as that of the unimproved <\s>
<s> carey as well as bastiat has declared that there is a law of increasing returns from land <\s>
<s> he points out that everything now existing could be reproduced to day at a less cost than that involved in its original production owing to our advance in skill knowledge and all the arts of production that for example it costs less to make an axe now than it did five hundred years ago so also with a farm since a farm of a given amount of productiveness can be brought into cultivation at less cost to day than that originally spent upon it <\s>
<s> the gain of society has we all admit been such that we produce almost everything at a less cost now than long ago but to class a farm and an axe together overlooks in the most remarkable way the fact that land can not be created by labor and capital while axes can and that too indefinitely <\s>
<s> nor can the produce from the land be increased indefinitely at a diminishing cost <\s>
<s> this is sometimes denied by the appeal to facts    it can be abundantly proved that if we take any two periods sufficiently distant to afford a fair test whether fifty or one hundred or five hundred years the production of the land relatively to the labor employed upon it has progressively become greater and greater    182 but this does not prove that an existing tendency to diminishing returns has not been more than offset by the progress of the arts and improvements <\s>
<s>    the advance of a ship against wind and tide is no proof that there is no wind and tide    in a work entitled    the past the present and the future    mr <\s>
<s> carey takes a ground of objection to the ricardo theory of rent namely that in point of historical fact the lands first brought under cultivation are not the most fertile but the barren lands <\s>
<s>    we find the settler invariably occupying the high and thin lands requiring little clearing and no drainage <\s>
<s> with the growth of population and wealth other soils yielding a larger return to labor are always brought into activity with a constantly increasing return to the labor expended upon them    in whatever order the lands come into cultivation those which when cultivated yield the least return in proportion to the labor required for their culture will always regulate the price of agricultural produce and all other lands will pay a rent simply equivalent to the excess of their produce over this minimum <\s>
<s> whatever unguarded expressions may have been occasionally used in describing the law of rent these two propositions are all that was ever intended by it <\s>
<s> carey could show that the return to labor from the land agricultural skill and science being supposed the same is not a diminishing return he would overthrow a principle much more fundamental than any law of rent <\s>
<s> but in this he has wholly failed <\s>
<s> another objection taken against the law of diminishing returns and so against the law of rent is that the potential increase of food e g of a grain of wheat is far greater than that of man 183 no one disputes the fact that one grain of wheat can reproduce itself more times than man and that too in a geometric increase but not without land <\s>
<s> a grain of wheat needs land in which it can multiply itself and this necessary element of its increase is limited and it is the very thing which limits the multiplication of the grains of wheat <\s>
<s> on the same piece of land one can not get more than what comes from one act of reproduction in the grain <\s>
<s> if one grain produces 100 of its kind doubling the capital will not repeatedly cause a geometric increase in the ratio of reproduction of each grain on this same land so that one grain by one process produces of its kind 200 400 800 or 1,600 because you can not multiply the land in any such ratio as would accompany this potential reduplication of the grain <\s>
<s> this objection would not seem worth answering were it not that it furnishes some difficulty to really honest inquirers <\s>
<s> others again allege as an objection against ricardo that if all land were of equal fertility it might still yield a rent <\s>
<s> but ricardo says precisely the same <\s>
<s> it is also distinctly a portion of ricardos doctrine that even apart from differences of situation the land of a country supposed to be of uniform fertility would all of it on a certain supposition pay rent namely if the demand of the community required that it should all be cultivated and cultivated beyond the point at which a further application of capital begins to be attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> this is simply the question before discussed whether if only one class of land were cultivated some agricultural capital would pay rent or not <\s>
<s> it all depends on the fact whether populationand so the demand for foodhas increased to the point where it calls out a recognition of the diminishing productiveness of the soil <\s>
<s> in that case different capitals would be invested so that there would be different returns to the same amount of capital and the prior or more advantageous investments of capital on the land would yield more than the ordinary rate of profit which could be claimed as rent <\s>

<s> the gain of society has we all admit been such that we produce almost everything at a less cost now than long ago but to class a farm and an axe together overlooks in the most remarkable way the fact that land can not be created by labor and capital while axes can and that too indefinitely <\s>
<s> nor can the produce from the land be increased indefinitely at a diminishing cost <\s>
<s> this is sometimes denied by the appeal to facts    it can be abundantly proved that if we take any two periods sufficiently distant to afford a fair test whether fifty or one hundred or five hundred years the production of the land relatively to the labor employed upon it has progressively become greater and greater    182 but this does not prove that an existing tendency to diminishing returns has not been more than offset by the progress of the arts and improvements <\s>
<s>    the advance of a ship against wind and tide is no proof that there is no wind and tide    in a work entitled    the past the present and the future    mr <\s>
<s> carey takes a ground of objection to the ricardo theory of rent namely that in point of historical fact the lands first brought under cultivation are not the most fertile but the barren lands <\s>
<s>    we find the settler invariably occupying the high and thin lands requiring little clearing and no drainage <\s>
<s> with the growth of population and wealth other soils yielding a larger return to labor are always brought into activity with a constantly increasing return to the labor expended upon them    in whatever order the lands come into cultivation those which when cultivated yield the least return in proportion to the labor required for their culture will always regulate the price of agricultural produce and all other lands will pay a rent simply equivalent to the excess of their produce over this minimum <\s>
<s> whatever unguarded expressions may have been occasionally used in describing the law of rent these two propositions are all that was ever intended by it <\s>
<s> carey could show that the return to labor from the land agricultural skill and science being supposed the same is not a diminishing return he would overthrow a principle much more fundamental than any law of rent <\s>
<s> but in this he has wholly failed <\s>
<s> another objection taken against the law of diminishing returns and so against the law of rent is that the potential increase of food e g of a grain of wheat is far greater than that of man 183 no one disputes the fact that one grain of wheat can reproduce itself more times than man and that too in a geometric increase but not without land <\s>
<s> a grain of wheat needs land in which it can multiply itself and this necessary element of its increase is limited and it is the very thing which limits the multiplication of the grains of wheat <\s>
<s> on the same piece of land one can not get more than what comes from one act of reproduction in the grain <\s>
<s> if one grain produces 100 of its kind doubling the capital will not repeatedly cause a geometric increase in the ratio of reproduction of each grain on this same land so that one grain by one process produces of its kind 200 400 800 or 1,600 because you can not multiply the land in any such ratio as would accompany this potential reduplication of the grain <\s>
<s> this objection would not seem worth answering were it not that it furnishes some difficulty to really honest inquirers <\s>
<s> others again allege as an objection against ricardo that if all land were of equal fertility it might still yield a rent <\s>
<s> but ricardo says precisely the same <\s>
<s> it is also distinctly a portion of ricardos doctrine that even apart from differences of situation the land of a country supposed to be of uniform fertility would all of it on a certain supposition pay rent namely if the demand of the community required that it should all be cultivated and cultivated beyond the point at which a further application of capital begins to be attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> this is simply the question before discussed whether if only one class of land were cultivated some agricultural capital would pay rent or not <\s>
<s> it all depends on the fact whether populationand so the demand for foodhas increased to the point where it calls out a recognition of the diminishing productiveness of the soil <\s>
<s> in that case different capitals would be invested so that there would be different returns to the same amount of capital and the prior or more advantageous investments of capital on the land would yield more than the ordinary rate of profit which could be claimed as rent <\s>
<s> perry 184 admits the law of diminishing returns but holds that    as land is capital and as every form of capital may be loaned or rented and thus become fruitful in the hands of another the rent of land does not differ essentially in its nature from the rent of buildings in cities or from the interest of money    henry george admits ricardos law of rent to its full extent but very curiously says    irrespective of the increase of population the effect of improvements in methods of production and exchange is to increase rent .... <\s>
<s> the effect of labor saving improvements will be to increase the production of wealth <\s>
<s> now for the production of wealth two things are required labor and land <\s>
<s> therefore the effect of labor saving improvements will be to extend the demand for land and wherever the limit of the quality of land in use is reached to bring into cultivation lands of less natural productiveness or to extend cultivation on the same lands to a point of lower natural productiveness <\s>
<s> and thus while the primary effect of labor saving improvements is to increase the power of labor the secondary effect is to extend cultivation and where this lowers the margin of cultivation to increase rent    185 francis bowen 186 rejects ricardos law and says    rent depends not on the increase but on the distribution of the populationasserting that the existence of large cities and towns determines the amount of rent paid by neighboring land 187   6 <\s>
<s> rent does not enter into the cost of production of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent does not really form any part of the expenses of agricultural production or of the advances of the capitalist <\s>
<s> the grounds on which this assertion was made are now apparent <\s>
<s> it is true that all tenant farmers and many other classes of producers pay rent <\s>
<s> but we have now seen that whoever cultivates land paying a rent for it gets in return for his rent an instrument of superior power to other instruments of the same kind for which no rent is paid <\s>
<s> the superiority of the instrument is in exact proportion to the rent paid for it <\s>
<s> if a few persons had steam engines of superior power to all others in existence but limited by physical laws to a number short of the demand the rent which a manufacturer would be willing to pay for one of these steam engines could not be looked upon as an addition to his outlay because by the use of it he would save in his other expenses the equivalent of what it cost him without it he could not do the same quantity of work unless at an additional expense equal to the rent <\s>
<s> the same thing is true of land <\s>
<s> the real expenses of production are those incurred on the worst land or by the capital employed in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> this land or capital pays as we have seen no rent but the expenses to which it is subject cause all other land or agricultural capital to be subjected to an equivalent expense in the form of rent <\s>
<s> whoever does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantages and the rent which he pays does not place him in a worse position than but only in the same position as his fellow producer who pays no rent but whose instrument is one of inferior efficiency <\s>
<s> soils are of every grade some which if cultivated might replace the capital but give no profit some give a slight but not an ordinary profit some the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> that is    there is a point up to which it is profitable to cultivate and beyond which it is not profitable to cultivate <\s>
<s> the price of corn will not for any long time remain at a higher rate than is sufficient to cover with ordinary profit the cost of that portion of the general crop which is raised at greatest expense    188 for similar reasons the price will not remain at a lower rate <\s>
<s> if then the cost of production of grain is determined by that land which replaces the capital yields only the ordinary profit and pays no rent rent forms no part of this cost since that land does not and can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> mcleod 189 however says it is not the cost of production which regulates the value of agricultural produce but the value which regulates the cost <\s>
<s> definitions of value in use exchange value and price <\s>
<s> it is evident that of the two great departments of political economy the production of wealth and its distribution the consideration of value has to do with the latter alone and with that only so far as competition and not usage or custom is the distributing agency <\s>
<s> the use of a thing in political economy means its capacity to satisfy a desire or serve a purpose <\s>
<s> diamonds have this capacity in a high degree and unless they had it would not bear any price <\s>
<s> value in use or as mr <\s>
<s> de quincey calls it teleologic value is the extreme limit of value in exchange <\s>
<s> the exchange value of a thing may fall short to any amount of its value in use but that it can ever exceed the value in use implies a contradiction it supposes that persons will give to possess a thing more than the utmost value which they themselves put upon it as a means of gratifying their inclinations <\s>
<s> the word value when used without adjunct always means in political economy value in exchange <\s>
<s> exchange value requires to be distinguished from price <\s>
<s> writers have employed price to express the value of a thing in relation to moneythe quantity of money for which it will exchange <\s>
<s> moreover suppose that lands down to grade three paid rent when a took the farm now if the price of produce rises slightly grade four may pay something but possibly not enough to warrant any rent going to a landlord <\s>
<s> a will put capital on it for this return but certainly not until the price warrants it that is not until the price will return him at least the cost of working the land plus the profit on his outlay <\s>
<s> but the community needed this land or the price would not have gone up to the point which makes possible its cultivation even for a profit without rent <\s>
<s> there must always be somewhere some land affected in just this way <\s>
<s>    or to the capital employed in the least advantageous circumstances <\s>
<s> let us however suppose that there were a validity in this objection which can by no means be conceded to it that when the demand of the community had forced up food to such a price as would remunerate the expense of producing it from a certain quality of soil it happened nevertheless that all the soil of that quality was withheld from cultivation the increase of produce which the wants of society required would for the time be obtained wholly as it always is partially not by an extension of cultivation but by an increased application of labor and capital to land already cultivated <\s>
<s> now we have already seen that this increased application of capital other things being unaltered is always attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> the rise of price enables measures to be taken for increasing the produce which could not have been taken with profit at the previous price <\s>
<s> the farmer uses more expensive manures or manures land which he formerly left to nature or procures lime or marl from a distance as a dressing for the soil or pulverizes or weeds it more thoroughly or drains irrigates or subsoils portions of it which at former prices would not have paid the cost of the operation and so forth <\s>
<s> the farmer or improver will only consider whether the outlay he makes for the purpose will be returned to him with the ordinary profit and not whether any surplus will remain for rent <\s>
<s> even therefore if it were the fact that there is never any land taken into cultivation for which rent and that too of an amount worth taking into consideration was not paid it would be true nevertheless that there is always some agricultural capital which pays no rent because it returns nothing beyond the ordinary rate of profit this capital being the portion of capital last appliedthat to which the last addition to the produce was due or to express the essentials of the case in one phrase that which is applied in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> but the same amount of demand and the same price which enable this least productive portion of capital barely to replace itself with the ordinary profit enable every other portion to yield a surplus proportioned to the advantage it possesses <\s>
<s> and this surplus it is which competition enables the landlord to appropriate <\s>
<s> if land were all occupied and of only one grade the first installment of labor and capital produced we will say twenty bushels of wheat when the price of wheat rose and it became profitable to resort to greater expense on the soil a second installment of the same amount of labor and capital when applied however only yielded fifteen bushels more a third ten bushels more and a fourth five bushels more <\s>
<s> the soil now gives fifty bushels only under the highest pressure <\s>
<s> but if it was profitable to invest the same installment of labor and capital simply for the five bushels that at first had received a return of twenty bushels the price must have gone up so that five bushels should sell for as much as the twenty did formerly so mutatis mutandis of installments second and third <\s>
<s> so that if the demand is such as to require all of the fifty bushels the agricultural capital which produced the five bushels will be the standard according to which the rent of the capital which grew twenty fifteen and ten bushels respectively is measured <\s>
<s> the principle is exactly the same as if equal installments of capital and labor were invested on four different grades of land returning twenty fifteen ten and five bushels for each installment <\s>
<s> or as if in the table on page 240 a b c and d each represented different installments of the same amount of labor and capital put upon the same spot of ground instead of being as there put upon different grades of land <\s>
<s> the rent of all land is measured by the excess of the return to the whole capital employed on it above what is necessary to replace the capital with the ordinary rate of profit or in other words above what the same capital would yield if it were all employed in as disadvantageous circumstances as the least productive portion of it whether that least productive portion of capital is rendered so by being employed on the worst soil or by being expended in extorting more produce from land which already yielded as much as it could be made to part with on easier terms <\s>
<s> it will be true that the farmer requires the ordinary rate of profit on the whole of his capital that whatever it returns to him beyond this he is obliged to pay to the landlord but will not consent to pay more that there is a portion of capital applied to agriculture in such circumstances of productiveness as to yield only the ordinary profits and that the difference between the produce of this and of any other capital of similar amount is the measure of the tribute which that other capital can and will pay under the name of rent to the landlord <\s>
<s> this constitutes a law of rent as near the truth as such a law can possibly be though of course modified or disturbed in individual cases by pending contracts individual miscalculations the influence of habit and even the particular feelings and dispositions of the persons concerned <\s>
<s> the law of rent in the economic sense operates in the united states as truly as elsewhere although there is no separate class of landlords here <\s>
<s> with us almost all land is owned by the cultivator so that two functions those of the landlord and farmer are both united in one person <\s>
<s> although one payment is made it is still just as distinctly made up of two parts one of which is a payment to the owner for the superior quality of his soil and the other a payment to the same person if the owner is the cultivator of profit on the farmers working capital <\s>
<s> land which in the united states will only return enough to pay a profit on this capital can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> and land which can pay more than a profit on this working capital returns that excess as rent even if the farmer is also the owner and landlord <\s>
<s> the principle which regulates the amount of that excesswhich is the essential pointis the principle which determines the amount of economic rent and it holds true in the united states or finland provided only that different grades of land are called into cultivation <\s>
<s> the governing principle is the same no matter whether a payment is made to one man as profit and to another as rent or whether the two payments are made to the same man in two capacities <\s>
<s> it has been urged that the law of rent does not hold in the united states because    the price of grain and other agricultural produce has not risen in proportion to the increase of our numbers as it ought to have done if ricardos theory were true but has fallen since 1830 though since that time our population has been more than tripled    181 this overlooks the fact that we have not even yet taken up all our best agricultural lands so that for some products the law of diminishing productiveness has not yet shown itself <\s>
<s> the reason is that the extension of our railway system has only of late years brought the really good grain lands into cultivation <\s>
<s> the fact that there has been no rise in agricultural products is due to the enormous extent of marvelously fertile grain lands in the west and to the cheapness of transportation from those districts to the seaboard <\s>
<s> for a general understanding of the law of rent the following table will show how under constant increase of population represented by four different advances of population in the first column first the best and then the poorer lands are brought into cultivation <\s>
<s> we will suppose 1 that the most fertile land a at first pays no rent then 2 when more food is wanted than land a can supply it will be profitable to till land b but which as yet pays no rent <\s>
<s> but if eighteen bushels are a sufficient return to a given amount of labor and capital then when an equal amount of labor and capital engaged on a returns twenty four bushels six of that are beyond the ordinary profit and form the rent on land a and so on c will next be the line of comparison and then d; as the poorer soils are cultivated the rent of a increases population a b c d increase <\s>

<s> under the name of rent many payments are commonly included which are not a remuneration for the original powers of the land itself but for capital expended on it <\s>

<s> the buildings like the cattle are not land but capital regularly consumed and reproduced and all payments made in consideration for them are properly interest <\s>
<s> but with regard to capital actually sunk in improvements and not requiring periodical renewal but spent once for all in giving the land a permanent increase of productiveness it appears to me that the return made to such capital loses altogether the character of profits and is governed by the principles of rent <\s>

<s> land which in the united states will only return enough to pay a profit on this capital can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> and land which can pay more than a profit on this working capital returns that excess as rent even if the farmer is also the owner and landlord <\s>
<s> the principle which regulates the amount of that excesswhich is the essential pointis the principle which determines the amount of economic rent and it holds true in the united states or finland provided only that different grades of land are called into cultivation <\s>
<s> the governing principle is the same no matter whether a payment is made to one man as profit and to another as rent or whether the two payments are made to the same man in two capacities <\s>
<s> it has been urged that the law of rent does not hold in the united states because    the price of grain and other agricultural produce has not risen in proportion to the increase of our numbers as it ought to have done if ricardos theory were true but has fallen since 1830 though since that time our population has been more than tripled    181 this overlooks the fact that we have not even yet taken up all our best agricultural lands so that for some products the law of diminishing productiveness has not yet shown itself <\s>
<s> the reason is that the extension of our railway system has only of late years brought the really good grain lands into cultivation <\s>
<s> the fact that there has been no rise in agricultural products is due to the enormous extent of marvelously fertile grain lands in the west and to the cheapness of transportation from those districts to the seaboard <\s>
<s> for a general understanding of the law of rent the following table will show how under constant increase of population represented by four different advances of population in the first column first the best and then the poorer lands are brought into cultivation <\s>
<s> we will suppose 1 that the most fertile land a at first pays no rent then 2 when more food is wanted than land a can supply it will be profitable to till land b but which as yet pays no rent <\s>

<s> opposing views of the law of rent <\s>
<s> under the name of rent many payments are commonly included which are not a remuneration for the original powers of the land itself but for capital expended on it <\s>
<s> the buildings are as distinct a thing from the farm as the stock or the timber on it and what is paid for them can no more be called rent of land than a payment for cattle would be if it were the custom that the landlord should stock the farm for the tenant <\s>
<s> the buildings like the cattle are not land but capital regularly consumed and reproduced and all payments made in consideration for them are properly interest <\s>
<s> but with regard to capital actually sunk in improvements and not requiring periodical renewal but spent once for all in giving the land a permanent increase of productiveness it appears to me that the return made to such capital loses altogether the character of profits and is governed by the principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is true that a landlord will not expend capital in improving his estate unless he expects from the improvement an increase of income surpassing the interest of his outlay <\s>
<s> prospectively this increase of income may be regarded as profit but when the expense has been incurred and the improvement made the rent of the improved land is governed by the same rules as that of the unimproved <\s>
<s> carey as well as bastiat has declared that there is a law of increasing returns from land <\s>
<s> he points out that everything now existing could be reproduced to day at a less cost than that involved in its original production owing to our advance in skill knowledge and all the arts of production that for example it costs less to make an axe now than it did five hundred years ago so also with a farm since a farm of a given amount of productiveness can be brought into cultivation at less cost to day than that originally spent upon it <\s>
<s> the gain of society has we all admit been such that we produce almost everything at a less cost now than long ago but to class a farm and an axe together overlooks in the most remarkable way the fact that land can not be created by labor and capital while axes can and that too indefinitely <\s>
<s> nor can the produce from the land be increased indefinitely at a diminishing cost <\s>
<s> this is sometimes denied by the appeal to facts    it can be abundantly proved that if we take any two periods sufficiently distant to afford a fair test whether fifty or one hundred or five hundred years the production of the land relatively to the labor employed upon it has progressively become greater and greater    182 but this does not prove that an existing tendency to diminishing returns has not been more than offset by the progress of the arts and improvements <\s>
<s>    the advance of a ship against wind and tide is no proof that there is no wind and tide    in a work entitled    the past the present and the future    mr <\s>
<s> carey takes a ground of objection to the ricardo theory of rent namely that in point of historical fact the lands first brought under cultivation are not the most fertile but the barren lands <\s>
<s>    we find the settler invariably occupying the high and thin lands requiring little clearing and no drainage <\s>
<s> with the growth of population and wealth other soils yielding a larger return to labor are always brought into activity with a constantly increasing return to the labor expended upon them    in whatever order the lands come into cultivation those which when cultivated yield the least return in proportion to the labor required for their culture will always regulate the price of agricultural produce and all other lands will pay a rent simply equivalent to the excess of their produce over this minimum <\s>
<s> whatever unguarded expressions may have been occasionally used in describing the law of rent these two propositions are all that was ever intended by it <\s>
<s> carey could show that the return to labor from the land agricultural skill and science being supposed the same is not a diminishing return he would overthrow a principle much more fundamental than any law of rent <\s>
<s> but in this he has wholly failed <\s>
<s> another objection taken against the law of diminishing returns and so against the law of rent is that the potential increase of food e g of a grain of wheat is far greater than that of man 183 no one disputes the fact that one grain of wheat can reproduce itself more times than man and that too in a geometric increase but not without land <\s>
<s> a grain of wheat needs land in which it can multiply itself and this necessary element of its increase is limited and it is the very thing which limits the multiplication of the grains of wheat <\s>
<s> on the same piece of land one can not get more than what comes from one act of reproduction in the grain <\s>
<s> if one grain produces 100 of its kind doubling the capital will not repeatedly cause a geometric increase in the ratio of reproduction of each grain on this same land so that one grain by one process produces of its kind 200 400 800 or 1,600 because you can not multiply the land in any such ratio as would accompany this potential reduplication of the grain <\s>
<s> this objection would not seem worth answering were it not that it furnishes some difficulty to really honest inquirers <\s>
<s> others again allege as an objection against ricardo that if all land were of equal fertility it might still yield a rent <\s>
<s> but ricardo says precisely the same <\s>
<s> it is also distinctly a portion of ricardos doctrine that even apart from differences of situation the land of a country supposed to be of uniform fertility would all of it on a certain supposition pay rent namely if the demand of the community required that it should all be cultivated and cultivated beyond the point at which a further application of capital begins to be attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> this is simply the question before discussed whether if only one class of land were cultivated some agricultural capital would pay rent or not <\s>
<s> it all depends on the fact whether populationand so the demand for foodhas increased to the point where it calls out a recognition of the diminishing productiveness of the soil <\s>
<s> in that case different capitals would be invested so that there would be different returns to the same amount of capital and the prior or more advantageous investments of capital on the land would yield more than the ordinary rate of profit which could be claimed as rent <\s>
<s> perry 184 admits the law of diminishing returns but holds that    as land is capital and as every form of capital may be loaned or rented and thus become fruitful in the hands of another the rent of land does not differ essentially in its nature from the rent of buildings in cities or from the interest of money    henry george admits ricardos law of rent to its full extent but very curiously says    irrespective of the increase of population the effect of improvements in methods of production and exchange is to increase rent .... <\s>
<s> the effect of labor saving improvements will be to increase the production of wealth <\s>
<s> now for the production of wealth two things are required labor and land <\s>
<s> therefore the effect of labor saving improvements will be to extend the demand for land and wherever the limit of the quality of land in use is reached to bring into cultivation lands of less natural productiveness or to extend cultivation on the same lands to a point of lower natural productiveness <\s>
<s> and thus while the primary effect of labor saving improvements is to increase the power of labor the secondary effect is to extend cultivation and where this lowers the margin of cultivation to increase rent    185 francis bowen 186 rejects ricardos law and says    rent depends not on the increase but on the distribution of the populationasserting that the existence of large cities and towns determines the amount of rent paid by neighboring land 187   6 <\s>
<s> rent does not enter into the cost of production of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent does not really form any part of the expenses of agricultural production or of the advances of the capitalist <\s>
<s> the grounds on which this assertion was made are now apparent <\s>
<s> it is true that all tenant farmers and many other classes of producers pay rent <\s>
<s> but we have now seen that whoever cultivates land paying a rent for it gets in return for his rent an instrument of superior power to other instruments of the same kind for which no rent is paid <\s>
<s> the superiority of the instrument is in exact proportion to the rent paid for it <\s>
<s> if a few persons had steam engines of superior power to all others in existence but limited by physical laws to a number short of the demand the rent which a manufacturer would be willing to pay for one of these steam engines could not be looked upon as an addition to his outlay because by the use of it he would save in his other expenses the equivalent of what it cost him without it he could not do the same quantity of work unless at an additional expense equal to the rent <\s>
<s> the same thing is true of land <\s>
<s> the real expenses of production are those incurred on the worst land or by the capital employed in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> this land or capital pays as we have seen no rent but the expenses to which it is subject cause all other land or agricultural capital to be subjected to an equivalent expense in the form of rent <\s>
<s> whoever does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantages and the rent which he pays does not place him in a worse position than but only in the same position as his fellow producer who pays no rent but whose instrument is one of inferior efficiency <\s>
<s> soils are of every grade some which if cultivated might replace the capital but give no profit some give a slight but not an ordinary profit some the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> that is    there is a point up to which it is profitable to cultivate and beyond which it is not profitable to cultivate <\s>
<s> the price of corn will not for any long time remain at a higher rate than is sufficient to cover with ordinary profit the cost of that portion of the general crop which is raised at greatest expense    188 for similar reasons the price will not remain at a lower rate <\s>
<s> if then the cost of production of grain is determined by that land which replaces the capital yields only the ordinary profit and pays no rent rent forms no part of this cost since that land does not and can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> mcleod 189 however says it is not the cost of production which regulates the value of agricultural produce but the value which regulates the cost <\s>
<s> definitions of value in use exchange value and price <\s>
<s> it is evident that of the two great departments of political economy the production of wealth and its distribution the consideration of value has to do with the latter alone and with that only so far as competition and not usage or custom is the distributing agency <\s>
<s> the use of a thing in political economy means its capacity to satisfy a desire or serve a purpose <\s>
<s> diamonds have this capacity in a high degree and unless they had it would not bear any price <\s>
<s> value in use or as mr <\s>
<s> de quincey calls it teleologic value is the extreme limit of value in exchange <\s>
<s> the exchange value of a thing may fall short to any amount of its value in use but that it can ever exceed the value in use implies a contradiction it supposes that persons will give to possess a thing more than the utmost value which they themselves put upon it as a means of gratifying their inclinations <\s>
<s> the word value when used without adjunct always means in political economy value in exchange <\s>
<s> exchange value requires to be distinguished from price <\s>
<s> writers have employed price to express the value of a thing in relation to moneythe quantity of money for which it will exchange <\s>
<s> moreover suppose that lands down to grade three paid rent when a took the farm now if the price of produce rises slightly grade four may pay something but possibly not enough to warrant any rent going to a landlord <\s>
<s> a will put capital on it for this return but certainly not until the price warrants it that is not until the price will return him at least the cost of working the land plus the profit on his outlay <\s>
<s> but the community needed this land or the price would not have gone up to the point which makes possible its cultivation even for a profit without rent <\s>
<s> there must always be somewhere some land affected in just this way <\s>
<s>    or to the capital employed in the least advantageous circumstances <\s>
<s> let us however suppose that there were a validity in this objection which can by no means be conceded to it that when the demand of the community had forced up food to such a price as would remunerate the expense of producing it from a certain quality of soil it happened nevertheless that all the soil of that quality was withheld from cultivation the increase of produce which the wants of society required would for the time be obtained wholly as it always is partially not by an extension of cultivation but by an increased application of labor and capital to land already cultivated <\s>
<s> now we have already seen that this increased application of capital other things being unaltered is always attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> the rise of price enables measures to be taken for increasing the produce which could not have been taken with profit at the previous price <\s>
<s> the farmer uses more expensive manures or manures land which he formerly left to nature or procures lime or marl from a distance as a dressing for the soil or pulverizes or weeds it more thoroughly or drains irrigates or subsoils portions of it which at former prices would not have paid the cost of the operation and so forth <\s>
<s> the farmer or improver will only consider whether the outlay he makes for the purpose will be returned to him with the ordinary profit and not whether any surplus will remain for rent <\s>
<s> even therefore if it were the fact that there is never any land taken into cultivation for which rent and that too of an amount worth taking into consideration was not paid it would be true nevertheless that there is always some agricultural capital which pays no rent because it returns nothing beyond the ordinary rate of profit this capital being the portion of capital last appliedthat to which the last addition to the produce was due or to express the essentials of the case in one phrase that which is applied in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> but the same amount of demand and the same price which enable this least productive portion of capital barely to replace itself with the ordinary profit enable every other portion to yield a surplus proportioned to the advantage it possesses <\s>
<s> and this surplus it is which competition enables the landlord to appropriate <\s>
<s> if land were all occupied and of only one grade the first installment of labor and capital produced we will say twenty bushels of wheat when the price of wheat rose and it became profitable to resort to greater expense on the soil a second installment of the same amount of labor and capital when applied however only yielded fifteen bushels more a third ten bushels more and a fourth five bushels more <\s>
<s> the soil now gives fifty bushels only under the highest pressure <\s>
<s> but if it was profitable to invest the same installment of labor and capital simply for the five bushels that at first had received a return of twenty bushels the price must have gone up so that five bushels should sell for as much as the twenty did formerly so mutatis mutandis of installments second and third <\s>
<s> so that if the demand is such as to require all of the fifty bushels the agricultural capital which produced the five bushels will be the standard according to which the rent of the capital which grew twenty fifteen and ten bushels respectively is measured <\s>
<s> the principle is exactly the same as if equal installments of capital and labor were invested on four different grades of land returning twenty fifteen ten and five bushels for each installment <\s>
<s> or as if in the table on page 240 a b c and d each represented different installments of the same amount of labor and capital put upon the same spot of ground instead of being as there put upon different grades of land <\s>
<s> the rent of all land is measured by the excess of the return to the whole capital employed on it above what is necessary to replace the capital with the ordinary rate of profit or in other words above what the same capital would yield if it were all employed in as disadvantageous circumstances as the least productive portion of it whether that least productive portion of capital is rendered so by being employed on the worst soil or by being expended in extorting more produce from land which already yielded as much as it could be made to part with on easier terms <\s>
<s> it will be true that the farmer requires the ordinary rate of profit on the whole of his capital that whatever it returns to him beyond this he is obliged to pay to the landlord but will not consent to pay more that there is a portion of capital applied to agriculture in such circumstances of productiveness as to yield only the ordinary profits and that the difference between the produce of this and of any other capital of similar amount is the measure of the tribute which that other capital can and will pay under the name of rent to the landlord <\s>
<s> this constitutes a law of rent as near the truth as such a law can possibly be though of course modified or disturbed in individual cases by pending contracts individual miscalculations the influence of habit and even the particular feelings and dispositions of the persons concerned <\s>
<s> the law of rent in the economic sense operates in the united states as truly as elsewhere although there is no separate class of landlords here <\s>
<s> with us almost all land is owned by the cultivator so that two functions those of the landlord and farmer are both united in one person <\s>

<s> the rise of price enables measures to be taken for increasing the produce which could not have been taken with profit at the previous price <\s>
<s> the farmer uses more expensive manures or manures land which he formerly left to nature or procures lime or marl from a distance as a dressing for the soil or pulverizes or weeds it more thoroughly or drains irrigates or subsoils portions of it which at former prices would not have paid the cost of the operation and so forth <\s>
<s> the farmer or improver will only consider whether the outlay he makes for the purpose will be returned to him with the ordinary profit and not whether any surplus will remain for rent <\s>
<s> even therefore if it were the fact that there is never any land taken into cultivation for which rent and that too of an amount worth taking into consideration was not paid it would be true nevertheless that there is always some agricultural capital which pays no rent because it returns nothing beyond the ordinary rate of profit this capital being the portion of capital last appliedthat to which the last addition to the produce was due or to express the essentials of the case in one phrase that which is applied in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> but the same amount of demand and the same price which enable this least productive portion of capital barely to replace itself with the ordinary profit enable every other portion to yield a surplus proportioned to the advantage it possesses <\s>
<s> and this surplus it is which competition enables the landlord to appropriate <\s>
<s> if land were all occupied and of only one grade the first installment of labor and capital produced we will say twenty bushels of wheat when the price of wheat rose and it became profitable to resort to greater expense on the soil a second installment of the same amount of labor and capital when applied however only yielded fifteen bushels more a third ten bushels more and a fourth five bushels more <\s>
<s> the soil now gives fifty bushels only under the highest pressure <\s>
<s> but if it was profitable to invest the same installment of labor and capital simply for the five bushels that at first had received a return of twenty bushels the price must have gone up so that five bushels should sell for as much as the twenty did formerly so mutatis mutandis of installments second and third <\s>
<s> so that if the demand is such as to require all of the fifty bushels the agricultural capital which produced the five bushels will be the standard according to which the rent of the capital which grew twenty fifteen and ten bushels respectively is measured <\s>
<s> the principle is exactly the same as if equal installments of capital and labor were invested on four different grades of land returning twenty fifteen ten and five bushels for each installment <\s>
<s> or as if in the table on page 240 a b c and d each represented different installments of the same amount of labor and capital put upon the same spot of ground instead of being as there put upon different grades of land <\s>
<s> the rent of all land is measured by the excess of the return to the whole capital employed on it above what is necessary to replace the capital with the ordinary rate of profit or in other words above what the same capital would yield if it were all employed in as disadvantageous circumstances as the least productive portion of it whether that least productive portion of capital is rendered so by being employed on the worst soil or by being expended in extorting more produce from land which already yielded as much as it could be made to part with on easier terms <\s>
<s> it will be true that the farmer requires the ordinary rate of profit on the whole of his capital that whatever it returns to him beyond this he is obliged to pay to the landlord but will not consent to pay more that there is a portion of capital applied to agriculture in such circumstances of productiveness as to yield only the ordinary profits and that the difference between the produce of this and of any other capital of similar amount is the measure of the tribute which that other capital can and will pay under the name of rent to the landlord <\s>
<s> this constitutes a law of rent as near the truth as such a law can possibly be though of course modified or disturbed in individual cases by pending contracts individual miscalculations the influence of habit and even the particular feelings and dispositions of the persons concerned <\s>
<s> the law of rent in the economic sense operates in the united states as truly as elsewhere although there is no separate class of landlords here <\s>
<s> with us almost all land is owned by the cultivator so that two functions those of the landlord and farmer are both united in one person <\s>
<s> although one payment is made it is still just as distinctly made up of two parts one of which is a payment to the owner for the superior quality of his soil and the other a payment to the same person if the owner is the cultivator of profit on the farmers working capital <\s>
<s> land which in the united states will only return enough to pay a profit on this capital can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> and land which can pay more than a profit on this working capital returns that excess as rent even if the farmer is also the owner and landlord <\s>
<s> the principle which regulates the amount of that excesswhich is the essential pointis the principle which determines the amount of economic rent and it holds true in the united states or finland provided only that different grades of land are called into cultivation <\s>
<s> the governing principle is the same no matter whether a payment is made to one man as profit and to another as rent or whether the two payments are made to the same man in two capacities <\s>
<s> it has been urged that the law of rent does not hold in the united states because    the price of grain and other agricultural produce has not risen in proportion to the increase of our numbers as it ought to have done if ricardos theory were true but has fallen since 1830 though since that time our population has been more than tripled    181 this overlooks the fact that we have not even yet taken up all our best agricultural lands so that for some products the law of diminishing productiveness has not yet shown itself <\s>
<s> the reason is that the extension of our railway system has only of late years brought the really good grain lands into cultivation <\s>
<s> the fact that there has been no rise in agricultural products is due to the enormous extent of marvelously fertile grain lands in the west and to the cheapness of transportation from those districts to the seaboard <\s>
<s> for a general understanding of the law of rent the following table will show how under constant increase of population represented by four different advances of population in the first column first the best and then the poorer lands are brought into cultivation <\s>
<s> we will suppose 1 that the most fertile land a at first pays no rent then 2 when more food is wanted than land a can supply it will be profitable to till land b but which as yet pays no rent <\s>

<s> opposing views of the law of rent <\s>
<s> under the name of rent many payments are commonly included which are not a remuneration for the original powers of the land itself but for capital expended on it <\s>
<s> the buildings are as distinct a thing from the farm as the stock or the timber on it and what is paid for them can no more be called rent of land than a payment for cattle would be if it were the custom that the landlord should stock the farm for the tenant <\s>
<s> the buildings like the cattle are not land but capital regularly consumed and reproduced and all payments made in consideration for them are properly interest <\s>
<s> but with regard to capital actually sunk in improvements and not requiring periodical renewal but spent once for all in giving the land a permanent increase of productiveness it appears to me that the return made to such capital loses altogether the character of profits and is governed by the principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is true that a landlord will not expend capital in improving his estate unless he expects from the improvement an increase of income surpassing the interest of his outlay <\s>
<s> prospectively this increase of income may be regarded as profit but when the expense has been incurred and the improvement made the rent of the improved land is governed by the same rules as that of the unimproved <\s>
<s> carey as well as bastiat has declared that there is a law of increasing returns from land <\s>
<s> he points out that everything now existing could be reproduced to day at a less cost than that involved in its original production owing to our advance in skill knowledge and all the arts of production that for example it costs less to make an axe now than it did five hundred years ago so also with a farm since a farm of a given amount of productiveness can be brought into cultivation at less cost to day than that originally spent upon it <\s>
<s> the gain of society has we all admit been such that we produce almost everything at a less cost now than long ago but to class a farm and an axe together overlooks in the most remarkable way the fact that land can not be created by labor and capital while axes can and that too indefinitely <\s>
<s> nor can the produce from the land be increased indefinitely at a diminishing cost <\s>
<s> this is sometimes denied by the appeal to facts    it can be abundantly proved that if we take any two periods sufficiently distant to afford a fair test whether fifty or one hundred or five hundred years the production of the land relatively to the labor employed upon it has progressively become greater and greater    182 but this does not prove that an existing tendency to diminishing returns has not been more than offset by the progress of the arts and improvements <\s>
<s>    the advance of a ship against wind and tide is no proof that there is no wind and tide    in a work entitled    the past the present and the future    mr <\s>
<s> carey takes a ground of objection to the ricardo theory of rent namely that in point of historical fact the lands first brought under cultivation are not the most fertile but the barren lands <\s>
<s>    we find the settler invariably occupying the high and thin lands requiring little clearing and no drainage <\s>
<s> with the growth of population and wealth other soils yielding a larger return to labor are always brought into activity with a constantly increasing return to the labor expended upon them    in whatever order the lands come into cultivation those which when cultivated yield the least return in proportion to the labor required for their culture will always regulate the price of agricultural produce and all other lands will pay a rent simply equivalent to the excess of their produce over this minimum <\s>
<s> whatever unguarded expressions may have been occasionally used in describing the law of rent these two propositions are all that was ever intended by it <\s>
<s> carey could show that the return to labor from the land agricultural skill and science being supposed the same is not a diminishing return he would overthrow a principle much more fundamental than any law of rent <\s>
<s> but in this he has wholly failed <\s>
<s> another objection taken against the law of diminishing returns and so against the law of rent is that the potential increase of food e g of a grain of wheat is far greater than that of man 183 no one disputes the fact that one grain of wheat can reproduce itself more times than man and that too in a geometric increase but not without land <\s>
<s> a grain of wheat needs land in which it can multiply itself and this necessary element of its increase is limited and it is the very thing which limits the multiplication of the grains of wheat <\s>
<s> on the same piece of land one can not get more than what comes from one act of reproduction in the grain <\s>
<s> if one grain produces 100 of its kind doubling the capital will not repeatedly cause a geometric increase in the ratio of reproduction of each grain on this same land so that one grain by one process produces of its kind 200 400 800 or 1,600 because you can not multiply the land in any such ratio as would accompany this potential reduplication of the grain <\s>
<s> this objection would not seem worth answering were it not that it furnishes some difficulty to really honest inquirers <\s>
<s> others again allege as an objection against ricardo that if all land were of equal fertility it might still yield a rent <\s>
<s> but ricardo says precisely the same <\s>
<s> it is also distinctly a portion of ricardos doctrine that even apart from differences of situation the land of a country supposed to be of uniform fertility would all of it on a certain supposition pay rent namely if the demand of the community required that it should all be cultivated and cultivated beyond the point at which a further application of capital begins to be attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> this is simply the question before discussed whether if only one class of land were cultivated some agricultural capital would pay rent or not <\s>
<s> it all depends on the fact whether populationand so the demand for foodhas increased to the point where it calls out a recognition of the diminishing productiveness of the soil <\s>
<s> in that case different capitals would be invested so that there would be different returns to the same amount of capital and the prior or more advantageous investments of capital on the land would yield more than the ordinary rate of profit which could be claimed as rent <\s>
<s> perry 184 admits the law of diminishing returns but holds that    as land is capital and as every form of capital may be loaned or rented and thus become fruitful in the hands of another the rent of land does not differ essentially in its nature from the rent of buildings in cities or from the interest of money    henry george admits ricardos law of rent to its full extent but very curiously says    irrespective of the increase of population the effect of improvements in methods of production and exchange is to increase rent .... <\s>
<s> the effect of labor saving improvements will be to increase the production of wealth <\s>
<s> now for the production of wealth two things are required labor and land <\s>
<s> therefore the effect of labor saving improvements will be to extend the demand for land and wherever the limit of the quality of land in use is reached to bring into cultivation lands of less natural productiveness or to extend cultivation on the same lands to a point of lower natural productiveness <\s>
<s> and thus while the primary effect of labor saving improvements is to increase the power of labor the secondary effect is to extend cultivation and where this lowers the margin of cultivation to increase rent    185 francis bowen 186 rejects ricardos law and says    rent depends not on the increase but on the distribution of the populationasserting that the existence of large cities and towns determines the amount of rent paid by neighboring land 187   6 <\s>
<s> rent does not enter into the cost of production of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent does not really form any part of the expenses of agricultural production or of the advances of the capitalist <\s>
<s> the grounds on which this assertion was made are now apparent <\s>
<s> it is true that all tenant farmers and many other classes of producers pay rent <\s>
<s> but we have now seen that whoever cultivates land paying a rent for it gets in return for his rent an instrument of superior power to other instruments of the same kind for which no rent is paid <\s>
<s> the superiority of the instrument is in exact proportion to the rent paid for it <\s>
<s> if a few persons had steam engines of superior power to all others in existence but limited by physical laws to a number short of the demand the rent which a manufacturer would be willing to pay for one of these steam engines could not be looked upon as an addition to his outlay because by the use of it he would save in his other expenses the equivalent of what it cost him without it he could not do the same quantity of work unless at an additional expense equal to the rent <\s>
<s> the same thing is true of land <\s>
<s> the real expenses of production are those incurred on the worst land or by the capital employed in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> this land or capital pays as we have seen no rent but the expenses to which it is subject cause all other land or agricultural capital to be subjected to an equivalent expense in the form of rent <\s>
<s> whoever does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantages and the rent which he pays does not place him in a worse position than but only in the same position as his fellow producer who pays no rent but whose instrument is one of inferior efficiency <\s>
<s> soils are of every grade some which if cultivated might replace the capital but give no profit some give a slight but not an ordinary profit some the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> that is    there is a point up to which it is profitable to cultivate and beyond which it is not profitable to cultivate <\s>
<s> the price of corn will not for any long time remain at a higher rate than is sufficient to cover with ordinary profit the cost of that portion of the general crop which is raised at greatest expense    188 for similar reasons the price will not remain at a lower rate <\s>
<s> if then the cost of production of grain is determined by that land which replaces the capital yields only the ordinary profit and pays no rent rent forms no part of this cost since that land does not and can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> mcleod 189 however says it is not the cost of production which regulates the value of agricultural produce but the value which regulates the cost <\s>
<s> definitions of value in use exchange value and price <\s>
<s> it is evident that of the two great departments of political economy the production of wealth and its distribution the consideration of value has to do with the latter alone and with that only so far as competition and not usage or custom is the distributing agency <\s>
<s> the use of a thing in political economy means its capacity to satisfy a desire or serve a purpose <\s>
<s> diamonds have this capacity in a high degree and unless they had it would not bear any price <\s>
<s> value in use or as mr <\s>
<s> de quincey calls it teleologic value is the extreme limit of value in exchange <\s>
<s> the exchange value of a thing may fall short to any amount of its value in use but that it can ever exceed the value in use implies a contradiction it supposes that persons will give to possess a thing more than the utmost value which they themselves put upon it as a means of gratifying their inclinations <\s>
<s> the word value when used without adjunct always means in political economy value in exchange <\s>
<s> exchange value requires to be distinguished from price <\s>
<s> writers have employed price to express the value of a thing in relation to moneythe quantity of money for which it will exchange <\s>
<s> moreover suppose that lands down to grade three paid rent when a took the farm now if the price of produce rises slightly grade four may pay something but possibly not enough to warrant any rent going to a landlord <\s>
<s> a will put capital on it for this return but certainly not until the price warrants it that is not until the price will return him at least the cost of working the land plus the profit on his outlay <\s>
<s> but the community needed this land or the price would not have gone up to the point which makes possible its cultivation even for a profit without rent <\s>
<s> there must always be somewhere some land affected in just this way <\s>
<s>    or to the capital employed in the least advantageous circumstances <\s>
<s> let us however suppose that there were a validity in this objection which can by no means be conceded to it that when the demand of the community had forced up food to such a price as would remunerate the expense of producing it from a certain quality of soil it happened nevertheless that all the soil of that quality was withheld from cultivation the increase of produce which the wants of society required would for the time be obtained wholly as it always is partially not by an extension of cultivation but by an increased application of labor and capital to land already cultivated <\s>

<s> the superiority of the instrument is in exact proportion to the rent paid for it <\s>
<s> if a few persons had steam engines of superior power to all others in existence but limited by physical laws to a number short of the demand the rent which a manufacturer would be willing to pay for one of these steam engines could not be looked upon as an addition to his outlay because by the use of it he would save in his other expenses the equivalent of what it cost him without it he could not do the same quantity of work unless at an additional expense equal to the rent <\s>
<s> the same thing is true of land <\s>
<s> the real expenses of production are those incurred on the worst land or by the capital employed in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> this land or capital pays as we have seen no rent but the expenses to which it is subject cause all other land or agricultural capital to be subjected to an equivalent expense in the form of rent <\s>
<s> whoever does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantages and the rent which he pays does not place him in a worse position than but only in the same position as his fellow producer who pays no rent but whose instrument is one of inferior efficiency <\s>
<s> soils are of every grade some which if cultivated might replace the capital but give no profit some give a slight but not an ordinary profit some the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> that is    there is a point up to which it is profitable to cultivate and beyond which it is not profitable to cultivate <\s>
<s> the price of corn will not for any long time remain at a higher rate than is sufficient to cover with ordinary profit the cost of that portion of the general crop which is raised at greatest expense    188 for similar reasons the price will not remain at a lower rate <\s>
<s> if then the cost of production of grain is determined by that land which replaces the capital yields only the ordinary profit and pays no rent rent forms no part of this cost since that land does not and can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> mcleod 189 however says it is not the cost of production which regulates the value of agricultural produce but the value which regulates the cost <\s>
<s> definitions of value in use exchange value and price <\s>
<s> it is evident that of the two great departments of political economy the production of wealth and its distribution the consideration of value has to do with the latter alone and with that only so far as competition and not usage or custom is the distributing agency <\s>
<s> the use of a thing in political economy means its capacity to satisfy a desire or serve a purpose <\s>
<s> diamonds have this capacity in a high degree and unless they had it would not bear any price <\s>
<s> value in use or as mr <\s>
<s> de quincey calls it teleologic value is the extreme limit of value in exchange <\s>
<s> the exchange value of a thing may fall short to any amount of its value in use but that it can ever exceed the value in use implies a contradiction it supposes that persons will give to possess a thing more than the utmost value which they themselves put upon it as a means of gratifying their inclinations <\s>
<s> the word value when used without adjunct always means in political economy value in exchange <\s>
<s> exchange value requires to be distinguished from price <\s>
<s> writers have employed price to express the value of a thing in relation to moneythe quantity of money for which it will exchange <\s>
<s> moreover suppose that lands down to grade three paid rent when a took the farm now if the price of produce rises slightly grade four may pay something but possibly not enough to warrant any rent going to a landlord <\s>
<s> a will put capital on it for this return but certainly not until the price warrants it that is not until the price will return him at least the cost of working the land plus the profit on his outlay <\s>
<s> but the community needed this land or the price would not have gone up to the point which makes possible its cultivation even for a profit without rent <\s>
<s> there must always be somewhere some land affected in just this way <\s>
<s>    or to the capital employed in the least advantageous circumstances <\s>
<s> let us however suppose that there were a validity in this objection which can by no means be conceded to it that when the demand of the community had forced up food to such a price as would remunerate the expense of producing it from a certain quality of soil it happened nevertheless that all the soil of that quality was withheld from cultivation the increase of produce which the wants of society required would for the time be obtained wholly as it always is partially not by an extension of cultivation but by an increased application of labor and capital to land already cultivated <\s>
<s> now we have already seen that this increased application of capital other things being unaltered is always attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> the rise of price enables measures to be taken for increasing the produce which could not have been taken with profit at the previous price <\s>
<s> the farmer uses more expensive manures or manures land which he formerly left to nature or procures lime or marl from a distance as a dressing for the soil or pulverizes or weeds it more thoroughly or drains irrigates or subsoils portions of it which at former prices would not have paid the cost of the operation and so forth <\s>
<s> the farmer or improver will only consider whether the outlay he makes for the purpose will be returned to him with the ordinary profit and not whether any surplus will remain for rent <\s>
<s> even therefore if it were the fact that there is never any land taken into cultivation for which rent and that too of an amount worth taking into consideration was not paid it would be true nevertheless that there is always some agricultural capital which pays no rent because it returns nothing beyond the ordinary rate of profit this capital being the portion of capital last appliedthat to which the last addition to the produce was due or to express the essentials of the case in one phrase that which is applied in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> but the same amount of demand and the same price which enable this least productive portion of capital barely to replace itself with the ordinary profit enable every other portion to yield a surplus proportioned to the advantage it possesses <\s>
<s> and this surplus it is which competition enables the landlord to appropriate <\s>
<s> if land were all occupied and of only one grade the first installment of labor and capital produced we will say twenty bushels of wheat when the price of wheat rose and it became profitable to resort to greater expense on the soil a second installment of the same amount of labor and capital when applied however only yielded fifteen bushels more a third ten bushels more and a fourth five bushels more <\s>
<s> the soil now gives fifty bushels only under the highest pressure <\s>
<s> but if it was profitable to invest the same installment of labor and capital simply for the five bushels that at first had received a return of twenty bushels the price must have gone up so that five bushels should sell for as much as the twenty did formerly so mutatis mutandis of installments second and third <\s>
<s> so that if the demand is such as to require all of the fifty bushels the agricultural capital which produced the five bushels will be the standard according to which the rent of the capital which grew twenty fifteen and ten bushels respectively is measured <\s>
<s> the principle is exactly the same as if equal installments of capital and labor were invested on four different grades of land returning twenty fifteen ten and five bushels for each installment <\s>
<s> or as if in the table on page 240 a b c and d each represented different installments of the same amount of labor and capital put upon the same spot of ground instead of being as there put upon different grades of land <\s>
<s> the rent of all land is measured by the excess of the return to the whole capital employed on it above what is necessary to replace the capital with the ordinary rate of profit or in other words above what the same capital would yield if it were all employed in as disadvantageous circumstances as the least productive portion of it whether that least productive portion of capital is rendered so by being employed on the worst soil or by being expended in extorting more produce from land which already yielded as much as it could be made to part with on easier terms <\s>
<s> it will be true that the farmer requires the ordinary rate of profit on the whole of his capital that whatever it returns to him beyond this he is obliged to pay to the landlord but will not consent to pay more that there is a portion of capital applied to agriculture in such circumstances of productiveness as to yield only the ordinary profits and that the difference between the produce of this and of any other capital of similar amount is the measure of the tribute which that other capital can and will pay under the name of rent to the landlord <\s>
<s> this constitutes a law of rent as near the truth as such a law can possibly be though of course modified or disturbed in individual cases by pending contracts individual miscalculations the influence of habit and even the particular feelings and dispositions of the persons concerned <\s>
<s> the law of rent in the economic sense operates in the united states as truly as elsewhere although there is no separate class of landlords here <\s>
<s> with us almost all land is owned by the cultivator so that two functions those of the landlord and farmer are both united in one person <\s>
<s> although one payment is made it is still just as distinctly made up of two parts one of which is a payment to the owner for the superior quality of his soil and the other a payment to the same person if the owner is the cultivator of profit on the farmers working capital <\s>
<s> land which in the united states will only return enough to pay a profit on this capital can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> and land which can pay more than a profit on this working capital returns that excess as rent even if the farmer is also the owner and landlord <\s>
<s> the principle which regulates the amount of that excesswhich is the essential pointis the principle which determines the amount of economic rent and it holds true in the united states or finland provided only that different grades of land are called into cultivation <\s>
<s> the governing principle is the same no matter whether a payment is made to one man as profit and to another as rent or whether the two payments are made to the same man in two capacities <\s>
<s> it has been urged that the law of rent does not hold in the united states because    the price of grain and other agricultural produce has not risen in proportion to the increase of our numbers as it ought to have done if ricardos theory were true but has fallen since 1830 though since that time our population has been more than tripled    181 this overlooks the fact that we have not even yet taken up all our best agricultural lands so that for some products the law of diminishing productiveness has not yet shown itself <\s>
<s> the reason is that the extension of our railway system has only of late years brought the really good grain lands into cultivation <\s>
<s> the fact that there has been no rise in agricultural products is due to the enormous extent of marvelously fertile grain lands in the west and to the cheapness of transportation from those districts to the seaboard <\s>
<s> for a general understanding of the law of rent the following table will show how under constant increase of population represented by four different advances of population in the first column first the best and then the poorer lands are brought into cultivation <\s>
<s> we will suppose 1 that the most fertile land a at first pays no rent then 2 when more food is wanted than land a can supply it will be profitable to till land b but which as yet pays no rent <\s>

<s> opposing views of the law of rent <\s>
<s> under the name of rent many payments are commonly included which are not a remuneration for the original powers of the land itself but for capital expended on it <\s>
<s> the buildings are as distinct a thing from the farm as the stock or the timber on it and what is paid for them can no more be called rent of land than a payment for cattle would be if it were the custom that the landlord should stock the farm for the tenant <\s>
<s> the buildings like the cattle are not land but capital regularly consumed and reproduced and all payments made in consideration for them are properly interest <\s>
<s> but with regard to capital actually sunk in improvements and not requiring periodical renewal but spent once for all in giving the land a permanent increase of productiveness it appears to me that the return made to such capital loses altogether the character of profits and is governed by the principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is true that a landlord will not expend capital in improving his estate unless he expects from the improvement an increase of income surpassing the interest of his outlay <\s>
<s> prospectively this increase of income may be regarded as profit but when the expense has been incurred and the improvement made the rent of the improved land is governed by the same rules as that of the unimproved <\s>
<s> carey as well as bastiat has declared that there is a law of increasing returns from land <\s>
<s> he points out that everything now existing could be reproduced to day at a less cost than that involved in its original production owing to our advance in skill knowledge and all the arts of production that for example it costs less to make an axe now than it did five hundred years ago so also with a farm since a farm of a given amount of productiveness can be brought into cultivation at less cost to day than that originally spent upon it <\s>
<s> the gain of society has we all admit been such that we produce almost everything at a less cost now than long ago but to class a farm and an axe together overlooks in the most remarkable way the fact that land can not be created by labor and capital while axes can and that too indefinitely <\s>
<s> nor can the produce from the land be increased indefinitely at a diminishing cost <\s>
<s> this is sometimes denied by the appeal to facts    it can be abundantly proved that if we take any two periods sufficiently distant to afford a fair test whether fifty or one hundred or five hundred years the production of the land relatively to the labor employed upon it has progressively become greater and greater    182 but this does not prove that an existing tendency to diminishing returns has not been more than offset by the progress of the arts and improvements <\s>
<s>    the advance of a ship against wind and tide is no proof that there is no wind and tide    in a work entitled    the past the present and the future    mr <\s>
<s> carey takes a ground of objection to the ricardo theory of rent namely that in point of historical fact the lands first brought under cultivation are not the most fertile but the barren lands <\s>
<s>    we find the settler invariably occupying the high and thin lands requiring little clearing and no drainage <\s>
<s> with the growth of population and wealth other soils yielding a larger return to labor are always brought into activity with a constantly increasing return to the labor expended upon them    in whatever order the lands come into cultivation those which when cultivated yield the least return in proportion to the labor required for their culture will always regulate the price of agricultural produce and all other lands will pay a rent simply equivalent to the excess of their produce over this minimum <\s>
<s> whatever unguarded expressions may have been occasionally used in describing the law of rent these two propositions are all that was ever intended by it <\s>
<s> carey could show that the return to labor from the land agricultural skill and science being supposed the same is not a diminishing return he would overthrow a principle much more fundamental than any law of rent <\s>
<s> but in this he has wholly failed <\s>
<s> another objection taken against the law of diminishing returns and so against the law of rent is that the potential increase of food e g of a grain of wheat is far greater than that of man 183 no one disputes the fact that one grain of wheat can reproduce itself more times than man and that too in a geometric increase but not without land <\s>
<s> a grain of wheat needs land in which it can multiply itself and this necessary element of its increase is limited and it is the very thing which limits the multiplication of the grains of wheat <\s>
<s> on the same piece of land one can not get more than what comes from one act of reproduction in the grain <\s>
<s> if one grain produces 100 of its kind doubling the capital will not repeatedly cause a geometric increase in the ratio of reproduction of each grain on this same land so that one grain by one process produces of its kind 200 400 800 or 1,600 because you can not multiply the land in any such ratio as would accompany this potential reduplication of the grain <\s>
<s> this objection would not seem worth answering were it not that it furnishes some difficulty to really honest inquirers <\s>
<s> others again allege as an objection against ricardo that if all land were of equal fertility it might still yield a rent <\s>
<s> but ricardo says precisely the same <\s>
<s> it is also distinctly a portion of ricardos doctrine that even apart from differences of situation the land of a country supposed to be of uniform fertility would all of it on a certain supposition pay rent namely if the demand of the community required that it should all be cultivated and cultivated beyond the point at which a further application of capital begins to be attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> this is simply the question before discussed whether if only one class of land were cultivated some agricultural capital would pay rent or not <\s>
<s> it all depends on the fact whether populationand so the demand for foodhas increased to the point where it calls out a recognition of the diminishing productiveness of the soil <\s>
<s> in that case different capitals would be invested so that there would be different returns to the same amount of capital and the prior or more advantageous investments of capital on the land would yield more than the ordinary rate of profit which could be claimed as rent <\s>
<s> perry 184 admits the law of diminishing returns but holds that    as land is capital and as every form of capital may be loaned or rented and thus become fruitful in the hands of another the rent of land does not differ essentially in its nature from the rent of buildings in cities or from the interest of money    henry george admits ricardos law of rent to its full extent but very curiously says    irrespective of the increase of population the effect of improvements in methods of production and exchange is to increase rent .... <\s>
<s> the effect of labor saving improvements will be to increase the production of wealth <\s>
<s> now for the production of wealth two things are required labor and land <\s>
<s> therefore the effect of labor saving improvements will be to extend the demand for land and wherever the limit of the quality of land in use is reached to bring into cultivation lands of less natural productiveness or to extend cultivation on the same lands to a point of lower natural productiveness <\s>
<s> and thus while the primary effect of labor saving improvements is to increase the power of labor the secondary effect is to extend cultivation and where this lowers the margin of cultivation to increase rent    185 francis bowen 186 rejects ricardos law and says    rent depends not on the increase but on the distribution of the populationasserting that the existence of large cities and towns determines the amount of rent paid by neighboring land 187   6 <\s>
<s> rent does not enter into the cost of production of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent does not really form any part of the expenses of agricultural production or of the advances of the capitalist <\s>
<s> the grounds on which this assertion was made are now apparent <\s>
<s> it is true that all tenant farmers and many other classes of producers pay rent <\s>
<s> but we have now seen that whoever cultivates land paying a rent for it gets in return for his rent an instrument of superior power to other instruments of the same kind for which no rent is paid <\s>

<s> carey could show that the return to labor from the land agricultural skill and science being supposed the same is not a diminishing return he would overthrow a principle much more fundamental than any law of rent <\s>
<s> but in this he has wholly failed <\s>
<s> another objection taken against the law of diminishing returns and so against the law of rent is that the potential increase of food e g of a grain of wheat is far greater than that of man 183 no one disputes the fact that one grain of wheat can reproduce itself more times than man and that too in a geometric increase but not without land <\s>
<s> a grain of wheat needs land in which it can multiply itself and this necessary element of its increase is limited and it is the very thing which limits the multiplication of the grains of wheat <\s>
<s> on the same piece of land one can not get more than what comes from one act of reproduction in the grain <\s>
<s> if one grain produces 100 of its kind doubling the capital will not repeatedly cause a geometric increase in the ratio of reproduction of each grain on this same land so that one grain by one process produces of its kind 200 400 800 or 1,600 because you can not multiply the land in any such ratio as would accompany this potential reduplication of the grain <\s>
<s> this objection would not seem worth answering were it not that it furnishes some difficulty to really honest inquirers <\s>
<s> others again allege as an objection against ricardo that if all land were of equal fertility it might still yield a rent <\s>
<s> but ricardo says precisely the same <\s>
<s> it is also distinctly a portion of ricardos doctrine that even apart from differences of situation the land of a country supposed to be of uniform fertility would all of it on a certain supposition pay rent namely if the demand of the community required that it should all be cultivated and cultivated beyond the point at which a further application of capital begins to be attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> this is simply the question before discussed whether if only one class of land were cultivated some agricultural capital would pay rent or not <\s>
<s> it all depends on the fact whether populationand so the demand for foodhas increased to the point where it calls out a recognition of the diminishing productiveness of the soil <\s>
<s> in that case different capitals would be invested so that there would be different returns to the same amount of capital and the prior or more advantageous investments of capital on the land would yield more than the ordinary rate of profit which could be claimed as rent <\s>
<s> perry 184 admits the law of diminishing returns but holds that    as land is capital and as every form of capital may be loaned or rented and thus become fruitful in the hands of another the rent of land does not differ essentially in its nature from the rent of buildings in cities or from the interest of money    henry george admits ricardos law of rent to its full extent but very curiously says    irrespective of the increase of population the effect of improvements in methods of production and exchange is to increase rent .... <\s>
<s> the effect of labor saving improvements will be to increase the production of wealth <\s>
<s> now for the production of wealth two things are required labor and land <\s>
<s> therefore the effect of labor saving improvements will be to extend the demand for land and wherever the limit of the quality of land in use is reached to bring into cultivation lands of less natural productiveness or to extend cultivation on the same lands to a point of lower natural productiveness <\s>
<s> and thus while the primary effect of labor saving improvements is to increase the power of labor the secondary effect is to extend cultivation and where this lowers the margin of cultivation to increase rent    185 francis bowen 186 rejects ricardos law and says    rent depends not on the increase but on the distribution of the populationasserting that the existence of large cities and towns determines the amount of rent paid by neighboring land 187   6 <\s>
<s> rent does not enter into the cost of production of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent does not really form any part of the expenses of agricultural production or of the advances of the capitalist <\s>
<s> the grounds on which this assertion was made are now apparent <\s>
<s> it is true that all tenant farmers and many other classes of producers pay rent <\s>
<s> but we have now seen that whoever cultivates land paying a rent for it gets in return for his rent an instrument of superior power to other instruments of the same kind for which no rent is paid <\s>
<s> the superiority of the instrument is in exact proportion to the rent paid for it <\s>
<s> if a few persons had steam engines of superior power to all others in existence but limited by physical laws to a number short of the demand the rent which a manufacturer would be willing to pay for one of these steam engines could not be looked upon as an addition to his outlay because by the use of it he would save in his other expenses the equivalent of what it cost him without it he could not do the same quantity of work unless at an additional expense equal to the rent <\s>
<s> the same thing is true of land <\s>
<s> the real expenses of production are those incurred on the worst land or by the capital employed in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> this land or capital pays as we have seen no rent but the expenses to which it is subject cause all other land or agricultural capital to be subjected to an equivalent expense in the form of rent <\s>
<s> whoever does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantages and the rent which he pays does not place him in a worse position than but only in the same position as his fellow producer who pays no rent but whose instrument is one of inferior efficiency <\s>
<s> soils are of every grade some which if cultivated might replace the capital but give no profit some give a slight but not an ordinary profit some the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> that is    there is a point up to which it is profitable to cultivate and beyond which it is not profitable to cultivate <\s>
<s> the price of corn will not for any long time remain at a higher rate than is sufficient to cover with ordinary profit the cost of that portion of the general crop which is raised at greatest expense    188 for similar reasons the price will not remain at a lower rate <\s>
<s> if then the cost of production of grain is determined by that land which replaces the capital yields only the ordinary profit and pays no rent rent forms no part of this cost since that land does not and can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> mcleod 189 however says it is not the cost of production which regulates the value of agricultural produce but the value which regulates the cost <\s>
<s> definitions of value in use exchange value and price <\s>
<s> it is evident that of the two great departments of political economy the production of wealth and its distribution the consideration of value has to do with the latter alone and with that only so far as competition and not usage or custom is the distributing agency <\s>
<s> the use of a thing in political economy means its capacity to satisfy a desire or serve a purpose <\s>
<s> diamonds have this capacity in a high degree and unless they had it would not bear any price <\s>
<s> value in use or as mr <\s>
<s> de quincey calls it teleologic value is the extreme limit of value in exchange <\s>
<s> the exchange value of a thing may fall short to any amount of its value in use but that it can ever exceed the value in use implies a contradiction it supposes that persons will give to possess a thing more than the utmost value which they themselves put upon it as a means of gratifying their inclinations <\s>
<s> the word value when used without adjunct always means in political economy value in exchange <\s>
<s> exchange value requires to be distinguished from price <\s>
<s> writers have employed price to express the value of a thing in relation to moneythe quantity of money for which it will exchange <\s>
<s> moreover suppose that lands down to grade three paid rent when a took the farm now if the price of produce rises slightly grade four may pay something but possibly not enough to warrant any rent going to a landlord <\s>
<s> a will put capital on it for this return but certainly not until the price warrants it that is not until the price will return him at least the cost of working the land plus the profit on his outlay <\s>
<s> but the community needed this land or the price would not have gone up to the point which makes possible its cultivation even for a profit without rent <\s>
<s> there must always be somewhere some land affected in just this way <\s>
<s>    or to the capital employed in the least advantageous circumstances <\s>
<s> let us however suppose that there were a validity in this objection which can by no means be conceded to it that when the demand of the community had forced up food to such a price as would remunerate the expense of producing it from a certain quality of soil it happened nevertheless that all the soil of that quality was withheld from cultivation the increase of produce which the wants of society required would for the time be obtained wholly as it always is partially not by an extension of cultivation but by an increased application of labor and capital to land already cultivated <\s>
<s> now we have already seen that this increased application of capital other things being unaltered is always attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> the rise of price enables measures to be taken for increasing the produce which could not have been taken with profit at the previous price <\s>
<s> the farmer uses more expensive manures or manures land which he formerly left to nature or procures lime or marl from a distance as a dressing for the soil or pulverizes or weeds it more thoroughly or drains irrigates or subsoils portions of it which at former prices would not have paid the cost of the operation and so forth <\s>
<s> the farmer or improver will only consider whether the outlay he makes for the purpose will be returned to him with the ordinary profit and not whether any surplus will remain for rent <\s>
<s> even therefore if it were the fact that there is never any land taken into cultivation for which rent and that too of an amount worth taking into consideration was not paid it would be true nevertheless that there is always some agricultural capital which pays no rent because it returns nothing beyond the ordinary rate of profit this capital being the portion of capital last appliedthat to which the last addition to the produce was due or to express the essentials of the case in one phrase that which is applied in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> but the same amount of demand and the same price which enable this least productive portion of capital barely to replace itself with the ordinary profit enable every other portion to yield a surplus proportioned to the advantage it possesses <\s>
<s> and this surplus it is which competition enables the landlord to appropriate <\s>
<s> if land were all occupied and of only one grade the first installment of labor and capital produced we will say twenty bushels of wheat when the price of wheat rose and it became profitable to resort to greater expense on the soil a second installment of the same amount of labor and capital when applied however only yielded fifteen bushels more a third ten bushels more and a fourth five bushels more <\s>
<s> the soil now gives fifty bushels only under the highest pressure <\s>
<s> but if it was profitable to invest the same installment of labor and capital simply for the five bushels that at first had received a return of twenty bushels the price must have gone up so that five bushels should sell for as much as the twenty did formerly so mutatis mutandis of installments second and third <\s>
<s> so that if the demand is such as to require all of the fifty bushels the agricultural capital which produced the five bushels will be the standard according to which the rent of the capital which grew twenty fifteen and ten bushels respectively is measured <\s>
<s> the principle is exactly the same as if equal installments of capital and labor were invested on four different grades of land returning twenty fifteen ten and five bushels for each installment <\s>
<s> or as if in the table on page 240 a b c and d each represented different installments of the same amount of labor and capital put upon the same spot of ground instead of being as there put upon different grades of land <\s>
<s> the rent of all land is measured by the excess of the return to the whole capital employed on it above what is necessary to replace the capital with the ordinary rate of profit or in other words above what the same capital would yield if it were all employed in as disadvantageous circumstances as the least productive portion of it whether that least productive portion of capital is rendered so by being employed on the worst soil or by being expended in extorting more produce from land which already yielded as much as it could be made to part with on easier terms <\s>
<s> it will be true that the farmer requires the ordinary rate of profit on the whole of his capital that whatever it returns to him beyond this he is obliged to pay to the landlord but will not consent to pay more that there is a portion of capital applied to agriculture in such circumstances of productiveness as to yield only the ordinary profits and that the difference between the produce of this and of any other capital of similar amount is the measure of the tribute which that other capital can and will pay under the name of rent to the landlord <\s>
<s> this constitutes a law of rent as near the truth as such a law can possibly be though of course modified or disturbed in individual cases by pending contracts individual miscalculations the influence of habit and even the particular feelings and dispositions of the persons concerned <\s>
<s> the law of rent in the economic sense operates in the united states as truly as elsewhere although there is no separate class of landlords here <\s>
<s> with us almost all land is owned by the cultivator so that two functions those of the landlord and farmer are both united in one person <\s>
<s> although one payment is made it is still just as distinctly made up of two parts one of which is a payment to the owner for the superior quality of his soil and the other a payment to the same person if the owner is the cultivator of profit on the farmers working capital <\s>
<s> land which in the united states will only return enough to pay a profit on this capital can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> and land which can pay more than a profit on this working capital returns that excess as rent even if the farmer is also the owner and landlord <\s>
<s> the principle which regulates the amount of that excesswhich is the essential pointis the principle which determines the amount of economic rent and it holds true in the united states or finland provided only that different grades of land are called into cultivation <\s>
<s> the governing principle is the same no matter whether a payment is made to one man as profit and to another as rent or whether the two payments are made to the same man in two capacities <\s>
<s> it has been urged that the law of rent does not hold in the united states because    the price of grain and other agricultural produce has not risen in proportion to the increase of our numbers as it ought to have done if ricardos theory were true but has fallen since 1830 though since that time our population has been more than tripled    181 this overlooks the fact that we have not even yet taken up all our best agricultural lands so that for some products the law of diminishing productiveness has not yet shown itself <\s>
<s> the reason is that the extension of our railway system has only of late years brought the really good grain lands into cultivation <\s>
<s> the fact that there has been no rise in agricultural products is due to the enormous extent of marvelously fertile grain lands in the west and to the cheapness of transportation from those districts to the seaboard <\s>
<s> for a general understanding of the law of rent the following table will show how under constant increase of population represented by four different advances of population in the first column first the best and then the poorer lands are brought into cultivation <\s>
<s> we will suppose 1 that the most fertile land a at first pays no rent then 2 when more food is wanted than land a can supply it will be profitable to till land b but which as yet pays no rent <\s>

<s> opposing views of the law of rent <\s>
<s> under the name of rent many payments are commonly included which are not a remuneration for the original powers of the land itself but for capital expended on it <\s>
<s> the buildings are as distinct a thing from the farm as the stock or the timber on it and what is paid for them can no more be called rent of land than a payment for cattle would be if it were the custom that the landlord should stock the farm for the tenant <\s>
<s> the buildings like the cattle are not land but capital regularly consumed and reproduced and all payments made in consideration for them are properly interest <\s>
<s> but with regard to capital actually sunk in improvements and not requiring periodical renewal but spent once for all in giving the land a permanent increase of productiveness it appears to me that the return made to such capital loses altogether the character of profits and is governed by the principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is true that a landlord will not expend capital in improving his estate unless he expects from the improvement an increase of income surpassing the interest of his outlay <\s>
<s> prospectively this increase of income may be regarded as profit but when the expense has been incurred and the improvement made the rent of the improved land is governed by the same rules as that of the unimproved <\s>
<s> carey as well as bastiat has declared that there is a law of increasing returns from land <\s>
<s> he points out that everything now existing could be reproduced to day at a less cost than that involved in its original production owing to our advance in skill knowledge and all the arts of production that for example it costs less to make an axe now than it did five hundred years ago so also with a farm since a farm of a given amount of productiveness can be brought into cultivation at less cost to day than that originally spent upon it <\s>
<s> the gain of society has we all admit been such that we produce almost everything at a less cost now than long ago but to class a farm and an axe together overlooks in the most remarkable way the fact that land can not be created by labor and capital while axes can and that too indefinitely <\s>
<s> nor can the produce from the land be increased indefinitely at a diminishing cost <\s>
<s> this is sometimes denied by the appeal to facts    it can be abundantly proved that if we take any two periods sufficiently distant to afford a fair test whether fifty or one hundred or five hundred years the production of the land relatively to the labor employed upon it has progressively become greater and greater    182 but this does not prove that an existing tendency to diminishing returns has not been more than offset by the progress of the arts and improvements <\s>

<s> opposing views of the law of rent <\s>
<s> under the name of rent many payments are commonly included which are not a remuneration for the original powers of the land itself but for capital expended on it <\s>
<s> the buildings are as distinct a thing from the farm as the stock or the timber on it and what is paid for them can no more be called rent of land than a payment for cattle would be if it were the custom that the landlord should stock the farm for the tenant <\s>
<s> the buildings like the cattle are not land but capital regularly consumed and reproduced and all payments made in consideration for them are properly interest <\s>
<s> but with regard to capital actually sunk in improvements and not requiring periodical renewal but spent once for all in giving the land a permanent increase of productiveness it appears to me that the return made to such capital loses altogether the character of profits and is governed by the principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is true that a landlord will not expend capital in improving his estate unless he expects from the improvement an increase of income surpassing the interest of his outlay <\s>
<s> prospectively this increase of income may be regarded as profit but when the expense has been incurred and the improvement made the rent of the improved land is governed by the same rules as that of the unimproved <\s>
<s> carey as well as bastiat has declared that there is a law of increasing returns from land <\s>
<s> he points out that everything now existing could be reproduced to day at a less cost than that involved in its original production owing to our advance in skill knowledge and all the arts of production that for example it costs less to make an axe now than it did five hundred years ago so also with a farm since a farm of a given amount of productiveness can be brought into cultivation at less cost to day than that originally spent upon it <\s>
<s> the gain of society has we all admit been such that we produce almost everything at a less cost now than long ago but to class a farm and an axe together overlooks in the most remarkable way the fact that land can not be created by labor and capital while axes can and that too indefinitely <\s>
<s> nor can the produce from the land be increased indefinitely at a diminishing cost <\s>
<s> this is sometimes denied by the appeal to facts    it can be abundantly proved that if we take any two periods sufficiently distant to afford a fair test whether fifty or one hundred or five hundred years the production of the land relatively to the labor employed upon it has progressively become greater and greater    182 but this does not prove that an existing tendency to diminishing returns has not been more than offset by the progress of the arts and improvements <\s>
<s>    the advance of a ship against wind and tide is no proof that there is no wind and tide    in a work entitled    the past the present and the future    mr <\s>
<s> carey takes a ground of objection to the ricardo theory of rent namely that in point of historical fact the lands first brought under cultivation are not the most fertile but the barren lands <\s>
<s>    we find the settler invariably occupying the high and thin lands requiring little clearing and no drainage <\s>
<s> with the growth of population and wealth other soils yielding a larger return to labor are always brought into activity with a constantly increasing return to the labor expended upon them    in whatever order the lands come into cultivation those which when cultivated yield the least return in proportion to the labor required for their culture will always regulate the price of agricultural produce and all other lands will pay a rent simply equivalent to the excess of their produce over this minimum <\s>
<s> whatever unguarded expressions may have been occasionally used in describing the law of rent these two propositions are all that was ever intended by it <\s>
<s> carey could show that the return to labor from the land agricultural skill and science being supposed the same is not a diminishing return he would overthrow a principle much more fundamental than any law of rent <\s>
<s> but in this he has wholly failed <\s>
<s> another objection taken against the law of diminishing returns and so against the law of rent is that the potential increase of food e g of a grain of wheat is far greater than that of man 183 no one disputes the fact that one grain of wheat can reproduce itself more times than man and that too in a geometric increase but not without land <\s>
<s> a grain of wheat needs land in which it can multiply itself and this necessary element of its increase is limited and it is the very thing which limits the multiplication of the grains of wheat <\s>
<s> on the same piece of land one can not get more than what comes from one act of reproduction in the grain <\s>
<s> if one grain produces 100 of its kind doubling the capital will not repeatedly cause a geometric increase in the ratio of reproduction of each grain on this same land so that one grain by one process produces of its kind 200 400 800 or 1,600 because you can not multiply the land in any such ratio as would accompany this potential reduplication of the grain <\s>
<s> this objection would not seem worth answering were it not that it furnishes some difficulty to really honest inquirers <\s>
<s> others again allege as an objection against ricardo that if all land were of equal fertility it might still yield a rent <\s>
<s> but ricardo says precisely the same <\s>
<s> it is also distinctly a portion of ricardos doctrine that even apart from differences of situation the land of a country supposed to be of uniform fertility would all of it on a certain supposition pay rent namely if the demand of the community required that it should all be cultivated and cultivated beyond the point at which a further application of capital begins to be attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> this is simply the question before discussed whether if only one class of land were cultivated some agricultural capital would pay rent or not <\s>
<s> it all depends on the fact whether populationand so the demand for foodhas increased to the point where it calls out a recognition of the diminishing productiveness of the soil <\s>
<s> in that case different capitals would be invested so that there would be different returns to the same amount of capital and the prior or more advantageous investments of capital on the land would yield more than the ordinary rate of profit which could be claimed as rent <\s>
<s> perry 184 admits the law of diminishing returns but holds that    as land is capital and as every form of capital may be loaned or rented and thus become fruitful in the hands of another the rent of land does not differ essentially in its nature from the rent of buildings in cities or from the interest of money    henry george admits ricardos law of rent to its full extent but very curiously says    irrespective of the increase of population the effect of improvements in methods of production and exchange is to increase rent .... <\s>
<s> the effect of labor saving improvements will be to increase the production of wealth <\s>
<s> now for the production of wealth two things are required labor and land <\s>
<s> therefore the effect of labor saving improvements will be to extend the demand for land and wherever the limit of the quality of land in use is reached to bring into cultivation lands of less natural productiveness or to extend cultivation on the same lands to a point of lower natural productiveness <\s>
<s> and thus while the primary effect of labor saving improvements is to increase the power of labor the secondary effect is to extend cultivation and where this lowers the margin of cultivation to increase rent    185 francis bowen 186 rejects ricardos law and says    rent depends not on the increase but on the distribution of the populationasserting that the existence of large cities and towns determines the amount of rent paid by neighboring land 187   6 <\s>
<s> rent does not enter into the cost of production of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent does not really form any part of the expenses of agricultural production or of the advances of the capitalist <\s>
<s> the grounds on which this assertion was made are now apparent <\s>
<s> it is true that all tenant farmers and many other classes of producers pay rent <\s>
<s> but we have now seen that whoever cultivates land paying a rent for it gets in return for his rent an instrument of superior power to other instruments of the same kind for which no rent is paid <\s>
<s> the superiority of the instrument is in exact proportion to the rent paid for it <\s>
<s> if a few persons had steam engines of superior power to all others in existence but limited by physical laws to a number short of the demand the rent which a manufacturer would be willing to pay for one of these steam engines could not be looked upon as an addition to his outlay because by the use of it he would save in his other expenses the equivalent of what it cost him without it he could not do the same quantity of work unless at an additional expense equal to the rent <\s>
<s> the same thing is true of land <\s>
<s> the real expenses of production are those incurred on the worst land or by the capital employed in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> this land or capital pays as we have seen no rent but the expenses to which it is subject cause all other land or agricultural capital to be subjected to an equivalent expense in the form of rent <\s>
<s> whoever does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantages and the rent which he pays does not place him in a worse position than but only in the same position as his fellow producer who pays no rent but whose instrument is one of inferior efficiency <\s>
<s> soils are of every grade some which if cultivated might replace the capital but give no profit some give a slight but not an ordinary profit some the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> that is    there is a point up to which it is profitable to cultivate and beyond which it is not profitable to cultivate <\s>
<s> the price of corn will not for any long time remain at a higher rate than is sufficient to cover with ordinary profit the cost of that portion of the general crop which is raised at greatest expense    188 for similar reasons the price will not remain at a lower rate <\s>
<s> if then the cost of production of grain is determined by that land which replaces the capital yields only the ordinary profit and pays no rent rent forms no part of this cost since that land does not and can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> mcleod 189 however says it is not the cost of production which regulates the value of agricultural produce but the value which regulates the cost <\s>
<s> definitions of value in use exchange value and price <\s>
<s> it is evident that of the two great departments of political economy the production of wealth and its distribution the consideration of value has to do with the latter alone and with that only so far as competition and not usage or custom is the distributing agency <\s>
<s> the use of a thing in political economy means its capacity to satisfy a desire or serve a purpose <\s>
<s> diamonds have this capacity in a high degree and unless they had it would not bear any price <\s>
<s> value in use or as mr <\s>
<s> de quincey calls it teleologic value is the extreme limit of value in exchange <\s>
<s> the exchange value of a thing may fall short to any amount of its value in use but that it can ever exceed the value in use implies a contradiction it supposes that persons will give to possess a thing more than the utmost value which they themselves put upon it as a means of gratifying their inclinations <\s>
<s> the word value when used without adjunct always means in political economy value in exchange <\s>
<s> exchange value requires to be distinguished from price <\s>
<s> writers have employed price to express the value of a thing in relation to moneythe quantity of money for which it will exchange <\s>
<s> moreover suppose that lands down to grade three paid rent when a took the farm now if the price of produce rises slightly grade four may pay something but possibly not enough to warrant any rent going to a landlord <\s>
<s> a will put capital on it for this return but certainly not until the price warrants it that is not until the price will return him at least the cost of working the land plus the profit on his outlay <\s>
<s> but the community needed this land or the price would not have gone up to the point which makes possible its cultivation even for a profit without rent <\s>
<s> there must always be somewhere some land affected in just this way <\s>
<s>    or to the capital employed in the least advantageous circumstances <\s>
<s> let us however suppose that there were a validity in this objection which can by no means be conceded to it that when the demand of the community had forced up food to such a price as would remunerate the expense of producing it from a certain quality of soil it happened nevertheless that all the soil of that quality was withheld from cultivation the increase of produce which the wants of society required would for the time be obtained wholly as it always is partially not by an extension of cultivation but by an increased application of labor and capital to land already cultivated <\s>
<s> now we have already seen that this increased application of capital other things being unaltered is always attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> the rise of price enables measures to be taken for increasing the produce which could not have been taken with profit at the previous price <\s>
<s> the farmer uses more expensive manures or manures land which he formerly left to nature or procures lime or marl from a distance as a dressing for the soil or pulverizes or weeds it more thoroughly or drains irrigates or subsoils portions of it which at former prices would not have paid the cost of the operation and so forth <\s>
<s> the farmer or improver will only consider whether the outlay he makes for the purpose will be returned to him with the ordinary profit and not whether any surplus will remain for rent <\s>
<s> even therefore if it were the fact that there is never any land taken into cultivation for which rent and that too of an amount worth taking into consideration was not paid it would be true nevertheless that there is always some agricultural capital which pays no rent because it returns nothing beyond the ordinary rate of profit this capital being the portion of capital last appliedthat to which the last addition to the produce was due or to express the essentials of the case in one phrase that which is applied in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> but the same amount of demand and the same price which enable this least productive portion of capital barely to replace itself with the ordinary profit enable every other portion to yield a surplus proportioned to the advantage it possesses <\s>
<s> and this surplus it is which competition enables the landlord to appropriate <\s>
<s> if land were all occupied and of only one grade the first installment of labor and capital produced we will say twenty bushels of wheat when the price of wheat rose and it became profitable to resort to greater expense on the soil a second installment of the same amount of labor and capital when applied however only yielded fifteen bushels more a third ten bushels more and a fourth five bushels more <\s>
<s> the soil now gives fifty bushels only under the highest pressure <\s>
<s> but if it was profitable to invest the same installment of labor and capital simply for the five bushels that at first had received a return of twenty bushels the price must have gone up so that five bushels should sell for as much as the twenty did formerly so mutatis mutandis of installments second and third <\s>
<s> so that if the demand is such as to require all of the fifty bushels the agricultural capital which produced the five bushels will be the standard according to which the rent of the capital which grew twenty fifteen and ten bushels respectively is measured <\s>
<s> the principle is exactly the same as if equal installments of capital and labor were invested on four different grades of land returning twenty fifteen ten and five bushels for each installment <\s>
<s> or as if in the table on page 240 a b c and d each represented different installments of the same amount of labor and capital put upon the same spot of ground instead of being as there put upon different grades of land <\s>
<s> the rent of all land is measured by the excess of the return to the whole capital employed on it above what is necessary to replace the capital with the ordinary rate of profit or in other words above what the same capital would yield if it were all employed in as disadvantageous circumstances as the least productive portion of it whether that least productive portion of capital is rendered so by being employed on the worst soil or by being expended in extorting more produce from land which already yielded as much as it could be made to part with on easier terms <\s>
<s> it will be true that the farmer requires the ordinary rate of profit on the whole of his capital that whatever it returns to him beyond this he is obliged to pay to the landlord but will not consent to pay more that there is a portion of capital applied to agriculture in such circumstances of productiveness as to yield only the ordinary profits and that the difference between the produce of this and of any other capital of similar amount is the measure of the tribute which that other capital can and will pay under the name of rent to the landlord <\s>
<s> this constitutes a law of rent as near the truth as such a law can possibly be though of course modified or disturbed in individual cases by pending contracts individual miscalculations the influence of habit and even the particular feelings and dispositions of the persons concerned <\s>
<s> the law of rent in the economic sense operates in the united states as truly as elsewhere although there is no separate class of landlords here <\s>
<s> with us almost all land is owned by the cultivator so that two functions those of the landlord and farmer are both united in one person <\s>
<s> although one payment is made it is still just as distinctly made up of two parts one of which is a payment to the owner for the superior quality of his soil and the other a payment to the same person if the owner is the cultivator of profit on the farmers working capital <\s>
<s> land which in the united states will only return enough to pay a profit on this capital can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> and land which can pay more than a profit on this working capital returns that excess as rent even if the farmer is also the owner and landlord <\s>
<s> the principle which regulates the amount of that excesswhich is the essential pointis the principle which determines the amount of economic rent and it holds true in the united states or finland provided only that different grades of land are called into cultivation <\s>
<s> the governing principle is the same no matter whether a payment is made to one man as profit and to another as rent or whether the two payments are made to the same man in two capacities <\s>
<s> it has been urged that the law of rent does not hold in the united states because    the price of grain and other agricultural produce has not risen in proportion to the increase of our numbers as it ought to have done if ricardos theory were true but has fallen since 1830 though since that time our population has been more than tripled    181 this overlooks the fact that we have not even yet taken up all our best agricultural lands so that for some products the law of diminishing productiveness has not yet shown itself <\s>
<s> the reason is that the extension of our railway system has only of late years brought the really good grain lands into cultivation <\s>

<s> but if it was profitable to invest the same installment of labor and capital simply for the five bushels that at first had received a return of twenty bushels the price must have gone up so that five bushels should sell for as much as the twenty did formerly so mutatis mutandis of installments second and third <\s>
<s> so that if the demand is such as to require all of the fifty bushels the agricultural capital which produced the five bushels will be the standard according to which the rent of the capital which grew twenty fifteen and ten bushels respectively is measured <\s>
<s> the principle is exactly the same as if equal installments of capital and labor were invested on four different grades of land returning twenty fifteen ten and five bushels for each installment <\s>
<s> or as if in the table on page 240 a b c and d each represented different installments of the same amount of labor and capital put upon the same spot of ground instead of being as there put upon different grades of land <\s>
<s> the rent of all land is measured by the excess of the return to the whole capital employed on it above what is necessary to replace the capital with the ordinary rate of profit or in other words above what the same capital would yield if it were all employed in as disadvantageous circumstances as the least productive portion of it whether that least productive portion of capital is rendered so by being employed on the worst soil or by being expended in extorting more produce from land which already yielded as much as it could be made to part with on easier terms <\s>
<s> it will be true that the farmer requires the ordinary rate of profit on the whole of his capital that whatever it returns to him beyond this he is obliged to pay to the landlord but will not consent to pay more that there is a portion of capital applied to agriculture in such circumstances of productiveness as to yield only the ordinary profits and that the difference between the produce of this and of any other capital of similar amount is the measure of the tribute which that other capital can and will pay under the name of rent to the landlord <\s>
<s> this constitutes a law of rent as near the truth as such a law can possibly be though of course modified or disturbed in individual cases by pending contracts individual miscalculations the influence of habit and even the particular feelings and dispositions of the persons concerned <\s>
<s> the law of rent in the economic sense operates in the united states as truly as elsewhere although there is no separate class of landlords here <\s>
<s> with us almost all land is owned by the cultivator so that two functions those of the landlord and farmer are both united in one person <\s>
<s> although one payment is made it is still just as distinctly made up of two parts one of which is a payment to the owner for the superior quality of his soil and the other a payment to the same person if the owner is the cultivator of profit on the farmers working capital <\s>
<s> land which in the united states will only return enough to pay a profit on this capital can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> and land which can pay more than a profit on this working capital returns that excess as rent even if the farmer is also the owner and landlord <\s>
<s> the principle which regulates the amount of that excesswhich is the essential pointis the principle which determines the amount of economic rent and it holds true in the united states or finland provided only that different grades of land are called into cultivation <\s>
<s> the governing principle is the same no matter whether a payment is made to one man as profit and to another as rent or whether the two payments are made to the same man in two capacities <\s>
<s> it has been urged that the law of rent does not hold in the united states because    the price of grain and other agricultural produce has not risen in proportion to the increase of our numbers as it ought to have done if ricardos theory were true but has fallen since 1830 though since that time our population has been more than tripled    181 this overlooks the fact that we have not even yet taken up all our best agricultural lands so that for some products the law of diminishing productiveness has not yet shown itself <\s>
<s> the reason is that the extension of our railway system has only of late years brought the really good grain lands into cultivation <\s>
<s> the fact that there has been no rise in agricultural products is due to the enormous extent of marvelously fertile grain lands in the west and to the cheapness of transportation from those districts to the seaboard <\s>
<s> for a general understanding of the law of rent the following table will show how under constant increase of population represented by four different advances of population in the first column first the best and then the poorer lands are brought into cultivation <\s>

<s> opposing views of the law of rent <\s>
<s> under the name of rent many payments are commonly included which are not a remuneration for the original powers of the land itself but for capital expended on it <\s>
<s> the buildings are as distinct a thing from the farm as the stock or the timber on it and what is paid for them can no more be called rent of land than a payment for cattle would be if it were the custom that the landlord should stock the farm for the tenant <\s>
<s> the buildings like the cattle are not land but capital regularly consumed and reproduced and all payments made in consideration for them are properly interest <\s>
<s> but with regard to capital actually sunk in improvements and not requiring periodical renewal but spent once for all in giving the land a permanent increase of productiveness it appears to me that the return made to such capital loses altogether the character of profits and is governed by the principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is true that a landlord will not expend capital in improving his estate unless he expects from the improvement an increase of income surpassing the interest of his outlay <\s>
<s> prospectively this increase of income may be regarded as profit but when the expense has been incurred and the improvement made the rent of the improved land is governed by the same rules as that of the unimproved <\s>
<s> carey as well as bastiat has declared that there is a law of increasing returns from land <\s>
<s> he points out that everything now existing could be reproduced to day at a less cost than that involved in its original production owing to our advance in skill knowledge and all the arts of production that for example it costs less to make an axe now than it did five hundred years ago so also with a farm since a farm of a given amount of productiveness can be brought into cultivation at less cost to day than that originally spent upon it <\s>
<s> the gain of society has we all admit been such that we produce almost everything at a less cost now than long ago but to class a farm and an axe together overlooks in the most remarkable way the fact that land can not be created by labor and capital while axes can and that too indefinitely <\s>
<s> nor can the produce from the land be increased indefinitely at a diminishing cost <\s>
<s> this is sometimes denied by the appeal to facts    it can be abundantly proved that if we take any two periods sufficiently distant to afford a fair test whether fifty or one hundred or five hundred years the production of the land relatively to the labor employed upon it has progressively become greater and greater    182 but this does not prove that an existing tendency to diminishing returns has not been more than offset by the progress of the arts and improvements <\s>
<s>    the advance of a ship against wind and tide is no proof that there is no wind and tide    in a work entitled    the past the present and the future    mr <\s>
<s> carey takes a ground of objection to the ricardo theory of rent namely that in point of historical fact the lands first brought under cultivation are not the most fertile but the barren lands <\s>
<s>    we find the settler invariably occupying the high and thin lands requiring little clearing and no drainage <\s>
<s> with the growth of population and wealth other soils yielding a larger return to labor are always brought into activity with a constantly increasing return to the labor expended upon them    in whatever order the lands come into cultivation those which when cultivated yield the least return in proportion to the labor required for their culture will always regulate the price of agricultural produce and all other lands will pay a rent simply equivalent to the excess of their produce over this minimum <\s>
<s> whatever unguarded expressions may have been occasionally used in describing the law of rent these two propositions are all that was ever intended by it <\s>
<s> carey could show that the return to labor from the land agricultural skill and science being supposed the same is not a diminishing return he would overthrow a principle much more fundamental than any law of rent <\s>
<s> but in this he has wholly failed <\s>
<s> another objection taken against the law of diminishing returns and so against the law of rent is that the potential increase of food e g of a grain of wheat is far greater than that of man 183 no one disputes the fact that one grain of wheat can reproduce itself more times than man and that too in a geometric increase but not without land <\s>
<s> a grain of wheat needs land in which it can multiply itself and this necessary element of its increase is limited and it is the very thing which limits the multiplication of the grains of wheat <\s>
<s> on the same piece of land one can not get more than what comes from one act of reproduction in the grain <\s>
<s> if one grain produces 100 of its kind doubling the capital will not repeatedly cause a geometric increase in the ratio of reproduction of each grain on this same land so that one grain by one process produces of its kind 200 400 800 or 1,600 because you can not multiply the land in any such ratio as would accompany this potential reduplication of the grain <\s>
<s> this objection would not seem worth answering were it not that it furnishes some difficulty to really honest inquirers <\s>
<s> others again allege as an objection against ricardo that if all land were of equal fertility it might still yield a rent <\s>
<s> but ricardo says precisely the same <\s>
<s> it is also distinctly a portion of ricardos doctrine that even apart from differences of situation the land of a country supposed to be of uniform fertility would all of it on a certain supposition pay rent namely if the demand of the community required that it should all be cultivated and cultivated beyond the point at which a further application of capital begins to be attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> this is simply the question before discussed whether if only one class of land were cultivated some agricultural capital would pay rent or not <\s>
<s> it all depends on the fact whether populationand so the demand for foodhas increased to the point where it calls out a recognition of the diminishing productiveness of the soil <\s>
<s> in that case different capitals would be invested so that there would be different returns to the same amount of capital and the prior or more advantageous investments of capital on the land would yield more than the ordinary rate of profit which could be claimed as rent <\s>
<s> perry 184 admits the law of diminishing returns but holds that    as land is capital and as every form of capital may be loaned or rented and thus become fruitful in the hands of another the rent of land does not differ essentially in its nature from the rent of buildings in cities or from the interest of money    henry george admits ricardos law of rent to its full extent but very curiously says    irrespective of the increase of population the effect of improvements in methods of production and exchange is to increase rent .... <\s>
<s> the effect of labor saving improvements will be to increase the production of wealth <\s>
<s> now for the production of wealth two things are required labor and land <\s>
<s> therefore the effect of labor saving improvements will be to extend the demand for land and wherever the limit of the quality of land in use is reached to bring into cultivation lands of less natural productiveness or to extend cultivation on the same lands to a point of lower natural productiveness <\s>
<s> and thus while the primary effect of labor saving improvements is to increase the power of labor the secondary effect is to extend cultivation and where this lowers the margin of cultivation to increase rent    185 francis bowen 186 rejects ricardos law and says    rent depends not on the increase but on the distribution of the populationasserting that the existence of large cities and towns determines the amount of rent paid by neighboring land 187   6 <\s>
<s> rent does not enter into the cost of production of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent does not really form any part of the expenses of agricultural production or of the advances of the capitalist <\s>
<s> the grounds on which this assertion was made are now apparent <\s>
<s> it is true that all tenant farmers and many other classes of producers pay rent <\s>
<s> but we have now seen that whoever cultivates land paying a rent for it gets in return for his rent an instrument of superior power to other instruments of the same kind for which no rent is paid <\s>
<s> the superiority of the instrument is in exact proportion to the rent paid for it <\s>
<s> if a few persons had steam engines of superior power to all others in existence but limited by physical laws to a number short of the demand the rent which a manufacturer would be willing to pay for one of these steam engines could not be looked upon as an addition to his outlay because by the use of it he would save in his other expenses the equivalent of what it cost him without it he could not do the same quantity of work unless at an additional expense equal to the rent <\s>
<s> the same thing is true of land <\s>
<s> the real expenses of production are those incurred on the worst land or by the capital employed in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> this land or capital pays as we have seen no rent but the expenses to which it is subject cause all other land or agricultural capital to be subjected to an equivalent expense in the form of rent <\s>
<s> whoever does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantages and the rent which he pays does not place him in a worse position than but only in the same position as his fellow producer who pays no rent but whose instrument is one of inferior efficiency <\s>
<s> soils are of every grade some which if cultivated might replace the capital but give no profit some give a slight but not an ordinary profit some the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> that is    there is a point up to which it is profitable to cultivate and beyond which it is not profitable to cultivate <\s>
<s> the price of corn will not for any long time remain at a higher rate than is sufficient to cover with ordinary profit the cost of that portion of the general crop which is raised at greatest expense    188 for similar reasons the price will not remain at a lower rate <\s>
<s> if then the cost of production of grain is determined by that land which replaces the capital yields only the ordinary profit and pays no rent rent forms no part of this cost since that land does not and can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> mcleod 189 however says it is not the cost of production which regulates the value of agricultural produce but the value which regulates the cost <\s>
<s> definitions of value in use exchange value and price <\s>
<s> it is evident that of the two great departments of political economy the production of wealth and its distribution the consideration of value has to do with the latter alone and with that only so far as competition and not usage or custom is the distributing agency <\s>
<s> the use of a thing in political economy means its capacity to satisfy a desire or serve a purpose <\s>
<s> diamonds have this capacity in a high degree and unless they had it would not bear any price <\s>
<s> value in use or as mr <\s>
<s> de quincey calls it teleologic value is the extreme limit of value in exchange <\s>
<s> the exchange value of a thing may fall short to any amount of its value in use but that it can ever exceed the value in use implies a contradiction it supposes that persons will give to possess a thing more than the utmost value which they themselves put upon it as a means of gratifying their inclinations <\s>
<s> the word value when used without adjunct always means in political economy value in exchange <\s>
<s> exchange value requires to be distinguished from price <\s>
<s> writers have employed price to express the value of a thing in relation to moneythe quantity of money for which it will exchange <\s>
<s> moreover suppose that lands down to grade three paid rent when a took the farm now if the price of produce rises slightly grade four may pay something but possibly not enough to warrant any rent going to a landlord <\s>
<s> a will put capital on it for this return but certainly not until the price warrants it that is not until the price will return him at least the cost of working the land plus the profit on his outlay <\s>
<s> but the community needed this land or the price would not have gone up to the point which makes possible its cultivation even for a profit without rent <\s>
<s> there must always be somewhere some land affected in just this way <\s>
<s>    or to the capital employed in the least advantageous circumstances <\s>
<s> let us however suppose that there were a validity in this objection which can by no means be conceded to it that when the demand of the community had forced up food to such a price as would remunerate the expense of producing it from a certain quality of soil it happened nevertheless that all the soil of that quality was withheld from cultivation the increase of produce which the wants of society required would for the time be obtained wholly as it always is partially not by an extension of cultivation but by an increased application of labor and capital to land already cultivated <\s>
<s> now we have already seen that this increased application of capital other things being unaltered is always attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> the rise of price enables measures to be taken for increasing the produce which could not have been taken with profit at the previous price <\s>
<s> the farmer uses more expensive manures or manures land which he formerly left to nature or procures lime or marl from a distance as a dressing for the soil or pulverizes or weeds it more thoroughly or drains irrigates or subsoils portions of it which at former prices would not have paid the cost of the operation and so forth <\s>
<s> the farmer or improver will only consider whether the outlay he makes for the purpose will be returned to him with the ordinary profit and not whether any surplus will remain for rent <\s>
<s> even therefore if it were the fact that there is never any land taken into cultivation for which rent and that too of an amount worth taking into consideration was not paid it would be true nevertheless that there is always some agricultural capital which pays no rent because it returns nothing beyond the ordinary rate of profit this capital being the portion of capital last appliedthat to which the last addition to the produce was due or to express the essentials of the case in one phrase that which is applied in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> but the same amount of demand and the same price which enable this least productive portion of capital barely to replace itself with the ordinary profit enable every other portion to yield a surplus proportioned to the advantage it possesses <\s>
<s> and this surplus it is which competition enables the landlord to appropriate <\s>
<s> if land were all occupied and of only one grade the first installment of labor and capital produced we will say twenty bushels of wheat when the price of wheat rose and it became profitable to resort to greater expense on the soil a second installment of the same amount of labor and capital when applied however only yielded fifteen bushels more a third ten bushels more and a fourth five bushels more <\s>

<s> or as if in the table on page 240 a b c and d each represented different installments of the same amount of labor and capital put upon the same spot of ground instead of being as there put upon different grades of land <\s>

<s> the word value when used without adjunct always means in political economy value in exchange <\s>
<s> exchange value requires to be distinguished from price <\s>
<s> writers have employed price to express the value of a thing in relation to moneythe quantity of money for which it will exchange <\s>
<s> moreover suppose that lands down to grade three paid rent when a took the farm now if the price of produce rises slightly grade four may pay something but possibly not enough to warrant any rent going to a landlord <\s>
<s> a will put capital on it for this return but certainly not until the price warrants it that is not until the price will return him at least the cost of working the land plus the profit on his outlay <\s>
<s> but the community needed this land or the price would not have gone up to the point which makes possible its cultivation even for a profit without rent <\s>
<s> there must always be somewhere some land affected in just this way <\s>
<s>    or to the capital employed in the least advantageous circumstances <\s>
<s> let us however suppose that there were a validity in this objection which can by no means be conceded to it that when the demand of the community had forced up food to such a price as would remunerate the expense of producing it from a certain quality of soil it happened nevertheless that all the soil of that quality was withheld from cultivation the increase of produce which the wants of society required would for the time be obtained wholly as it always is partially not by an extension of cultivation but by an increased application of labor and capital to land already cultivated <\s>
<s> now we have already seen that this increased application of capital other things being unaltered is always attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> the rise of price enables measures to be taken for increasing the produce which could not have been taken with profit at the previous price <\s>
<s> the farmer uses more expensive manures or manures land which he formerly left to nature or procures lime or marl from a distance as a dressing for the soil or pulverizes or weeds it more thoroughly or drains irrigates or subsoils portions of it which at former prices would not have paid the cost of the operation and so forth <\s>
<s> the farmer or improver will only consider whether the outlay he makes for the purpose will be returned to him with the ordinary profit and not whether any surplus will remain for rent <\s>
<s> even therefore if it were the fact that there is never any land taken into cultivation for which rent and that too of an amount worth taking into consideration was not paid it would be true nevertheless that there is always some agricultural capital which pays no rent because it returns nothing beyond the ordinary rate of profit this capital being the portion of capital last appliedthat to which the last addition to the produce was due or to express the essentials of the case in one phrase that which is applied in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> but the same amount of demand and the same price which enable this least productive portion of capital barely to replace itself with the ordinary profit enable every other portion to yield a surplus proportioned to the advantage it possesses <\s>
<s> and this surplus it is which competition enables the landlord to appropriate <\s>
<s> if land were all occupied and of only one grade the first installment of labor and capital produced we will say twenty bushels of wheat when the price of wheat rose and it became profitable to resort to greater expense on the soil a second installment of the same amount of labor and capital when applied however only yielded fifteen bushels more a third ten bushels more and a fourth five bushels more <\s>
<s> the soil now gives fifty bushels only under the highest pressure <\s>
<s> but if it was profitable to invest the same installment of labor and capital simply for the five bushels that at first had received a return of twenty bushels the price must have gone up so that five bushels should sell for as much as the twenty did formerly so mutatis mutandis of installments second and third <\s>
<s> so that if the demand is such as to require all of the fifty bushels the agricultural capital which produced the five bushels will be the standard according to which the rent of the capital which grew twenty fifteen and ten bushels respectively is measured <\s>
<s> the principle is exactly the same as if equal installments of capital and labor were invested on four different grades of land returning twenty fifteen ten and five bushels for each installment <\s>
<s> or as if in the table on page 240 a b c and d each represented different installments of the same amount of labor and capital put upon the same spot of ground instead of being as there put upon different grades of land <\s>
<s> the rent of all land is measured by the excess of the return to the whole capital employed on it above what is necessary to replace the capital with the ordinary rate of profit or in other words above what the same capital would yield if it were all employed in as disadvantageous circumstances as the least productive portion of it whether that least productive portion of capital is rendered so by being employed on the worst soil or by being expended in extorting more produce from land which already yielded as much as it could be made to part with on easier terms <\s>
<s> it will be true that the farmer requires the ordinary rate of profit on the whole of his capital that whatever it returns to him beyond this he is obliged to pay to the landlord but will not consent to pay more that there is a portion of capital applied to agriculture in such circumstances of productiveness as to yield only the ordinary profits and that the difference between the produce of this and of any other capital of similar amount is the measure of the tribute which that other capital can and will pay under the name of rent to the landlord <\s>
<s> this constitutes a law of rent as near the truth as such a law can possibly be though of course modified or disturbed in individual cases by pending contracts individual miscalculations the influence of habit and even the particular feelings and dispositions of the persons concerned <\s>
<s> the law of rent in the economic sense operates in the united states as truly as elsewhere although there is no separate class of landlords here <\s>
<s> with us almost all land is owned by the cultivator so that two functions those of the landlord and farmer are both united in one person <\s>
<s> although one payment is made it is still just as distinctly made up of two parts one of which is a payment to the owner for the superior quality of his soil and the other a payment to the same person if the owner is the cultivator of profit on the farmers working capital <\s>
<s> land which in the united states will only return enough to pay a profit on this capital can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> and land which can pay more than a profit on this working capital returns that excess as rent even if the farmer is also the owner and landlord <\s>
<s> the principle which regulates the amount of that excesswhich is the essential pointis the principle which determines the amount of economic rent and it holds true in the united states or finland provided only that different grades of land are called into cultivation <\s>
<s> the governing principle is the same no matter whether a payment is made to one man as profit and to another as rent or whether the two payments are made to the same man in two capacities <\s>
<s> it has been urged that the law of rent does not hold in the united states because    the price of grain and other agricultural produce has not risen in proportion to the increase of our numbers as it ought to have done if ricardos theory were true but has fallen since 1830 though since that time our population has been more than tripled    181 this overlooks the fact that we have not even yet taken up all our best agricultural lands so that for some products the law of diminishing productiveness has not yet shown itself <\s>
<s> the reason is that the extension of our railway system has only of late years brought the really good grain lands into cultivation <\s>
<s> the fact that there has been no rise in agricultural products is due to the enormous extent of marvelously fertile grain lands in the west and to the cheapness of transportation from those districts to the seaboard <\s>

<s> opposing views of the law of rent <\s>
<s> under the name of rent many payments are commonly included which are not a remuneration for the original powers of the land itself but for capital expended on it <\s>
<s> the buildings are as distinct a thing from the farm as the stock or the timber on it and what is paid for them can no more be called rent of land than a payment for cattle would be if it were the custom that the landlord should stock the farm for the tenant <\s>
<s> the buildings like the cattle are not land but capital regularly consumed and reproduced and all payments made in consideration for them are properly interest <\s>
<s> but with regard to capital actually sunk in improvements and not requiring periodical renewal but spent once for all in giving the land a permanent increase of productiveness it appears to me that the return made to such capital loses altogether the character of profits and is governed by the principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is true that a landlord will not expend capital in improving his estate unless he expects from the improvement an increase of income surpassing the interest of his outlay <\s>
<s> prospectively this increase of income may be regarded as profit but when the expense has been incurred and the improvement made the rent of the improved land is governed by the same rules as that of the unimproved <\s>
<s> carey as well as bastiat has declared that there is a law of increasing returns from land <\s>
<s> he points out that everything now existing could be reproduced to day at a less cost than that involved in its original production owing to our advance in skill knowledge and all the arts of production that for example it costs less to make an axe now than it did five hundred years ago so also with a farm since a farm of a given amount of productiveness can be brought into cultivation at less cost to day than that originally spent upon it <\s>
<s> the gain of society has we all admit been such that we produce almost everything at a less cost now than long ago but to class a farm and an axe together overlooks in the most remarkable way the fact that land can not be created by labor and capital while axes can and that too indefinitely <\s>
<s> nor can the produce from the land be increased indefinitely at a diminishing cost <\s>
<s> this is sometimes denied by the appeal to facts    it can be abundantly proved that if we take any two periods sufficiently distant to afford a fair test whether fifty or one hundred or five hundred years the production of the land relatively to the labor employed upon it has progressively become greater and greater    182 but this does not prove that an existing tendency to diminishing returns has not been more than offset by the progress of the arts and improvements <\s>
<s>    the advance of a ship against wind and tide is no proof that there is no wind and tide    in a work entitled    the past the present and the future    mr <\s>
<s> carey takes a ground of objection to the ricardo theory of rent namely that in point of historical fact the lands first brought under cultivation are not the most fertile but the barren lands <\s>
<s>    we find the settler invariably occupying the high and thin lands requiring little clearing and no drainage <\s>
<s> with the growth of population and wealth other soils yielding a larger return to labor are always brought into activity with a constantly increasing return to the labor expended upon them    in whatever order the lands come into cultivation those which when cultivated yield the least return in proportion to the labor required for their culture will always regulate the price of agricultural produce and all other lands will pay a rent simply equivalent to the excess of their produce over this minimum <\s>
<s> whatever unguarded expressions may have been occasionally used in describing the law of rent these two propositions are all that was ever intended by it <\s>
<s> carey could show that the return to labor from the land agricultural skill and science being supposed the same is not a diminishing return he would overthrow a principle much more fundamental than any law of rent <\s>
<s> but in this he has wholly failed <\s>
<s> another objection taken against the law of diminishing returns and so against the law of rent is that the potential increase of food e g of a grain of wheat is far greater than that of man 183 no one disputes the fact that one grain of wheat can reproduce itself more times than man and that too in a geometric increase but not without land <\s>
<s> a grain of wheat needs land in which it can multiply itself and this necessary element of its increase is limited and it is the very thing which limits the multiplication of the grains of wheat <\s>
<s> on the same piece of land one can not get more than what comes from one act of reproduction in the grain <\s>
<s> if one grain produces 100 of its kind doubling the capital will not repeatedly cause a geometric increase in the ratio of reproduction of each grain on this same land so that one grain by one process produces of its kind 200 400 800 or 1,600 because you can not multiply the land in any such ratio as would accompany this potential reduplication of the grain <\s>
<s> this objection would not seem worth answering were it not that it furnishes some difficulty to really honest inquirers <\s>
<s> others again allege as an objection against ricardo that if all land were of equal fertility it might still yield a rent <\s>
<s> but ricardo says precisely the same <\s>
<s> it is also distinctly a portion of ricardos doctrine that even apart from differences of situation the land of a country supposed to be of uniform fertility would all of it on a certain supposition pay rent namely if the demand of the community required that it should all be cultivated and cultivated beyond the point at which a further application of capital begins to be attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> this is simply the question before discussed whether if only one class of land were cultivated some agricultural capital would pay rent or not <\s>
<s> it all depends on the fact whether populationand so the demand for foodhas increased to the point where it calls out a recognition of the diminishing productiveness of the soil <\s>
<s> in that case different capitals would be invested so that there would be different returns to the same amount of capital and the prior or more advantageous investments of capital on the land would yield more than the ordinary rate of profit which could be claimed as rent <\s>
<s> perry 184 admits the law of diminishing returns but holds that    as land is capital and as every form of capital may be loaned or rented and thus become fruitful in the hands of another the rent of land does not differ essentially in its nature from the rent of buildings in cities or from the interest of money    henry george admits ricardos law of rent to its full extent but very curiously says    irrespective of the increase of population the effect of improvements in methods of production and exchange is to increase rent .... <\s>
<s> the effect of labor saving improvements will be to increase the production of wealth <\s>
<s> now for the production of wealth two things are required labor and land <\s>
<s> therefore the effect of labor saving improvements will be to extend the demand for land and wherever the limit of the quality of land in use is reached to bring into cultivation lands of less natural productiveness or to extend cultivation on the same lands to a point of lower natural productiveness <\s>
<s> and thus while the primary effect of labor saving improvements is to increase the power of labor the secondary effect is to extend cultivation and where this lowers the margin of cultivation to increase rent    185 francis bowen 186 rejects ricardos law and says    rent depends not on the increase but on the distribution of the populationasserting that the existence of large cities and towns determines the amount of rent paid by neighboring land 187   6 <\s>
<s> rent does not enter into the cost of production of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent does not really form any part of the expenses of agricultural production or of the advances of the capitalist <\s>
<s> the grounds on which this assertion was made are now apparent <\s>
<s> it is true that all tenant farmers and many other classes of producers pay rent <\s>
<s> but we have now seen that whoever cultivates land paying a rent for it gets in return for his rent an instrument of superior power to other instruments of the same kind for which no rent is paid <\s>
<s> the superiority of the instrument is in exact proportion to the rent paid for it <\s>
<s> if a few persons had steam engines of superior power to all others in existence but limited by physical laws to a number short of the demand the rent which a manufacturer would be willing to pay for one of these steam engines could not be looked upon as an addition to his outlay because by the use of it he would save in his other expenses the equivalent of what it cost him without it he could not do the same quantity of work unless at an additional expense equal to the rent <\s>
<s> the same thing is true of land <\s>
<s> the real expenses of production are those incurred on the worst land or by the capital employed in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> this land or capital pays as we have seen no rent but the expenses to which it is subject cause all other land or agricultural capital to be subjected to an equivalent expense in the form of rent <\s>
<s> whoever does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantages and the rent which he pays does not place him in a worse position than but only in the same position as his fellow producer who pays no rent but whose instrument is one of inferior efficiency <\s>
<s> soils are of every grade some which if cultivated might replace the capital but give no profit some give a slight but not an ordinary profit some the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> that is    there is a point up to which it is profitable to cultivate and beyond which it is not profitable to cultivate <\s>
<s> the price of corn will not for any long time remain at a higher rate than is sufficient to cover with ordinary profit the cost of that portion of the general crop which is raised at greatest expense    188 for similar reasons the price will not remain at a lower rate <\s>
<s> if then the cost of production of grain is determined by that land which replaces the capital yields only the ordinary profit and pays no rent rent forms no part of this cost since that land does not and can not pay any rent <\s>

<s> it is also distinctly a portion of ricardos doctrine that even apart from differences of situation the land of a country supposed to be of uniform fertility would all of it on a certain supposition pay rent namely if the demand of the community required that it should all be cultivated and cultivated beyond the point at which a further application of capital begins to be attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> this is simply the question before discussed whether if only one class of land were cultivated some agricultural capital would pay rent or not <\s>
<s> it all depends on the fact whether populationand so the demand for foodhas increased to the point where it calls out a recognition of the diminishing productiveness of the soil <\s>
<s> in that case different capitals would be invested so that there would be different returns to the same amount of capital and the prior or more advantageous investments of capital on the land would yield more than the ordinary rate of profit which could be claimed as rent <\s>
<s> perry 184 admits the law of diminishing returns but holds that    as land is capital and as every form of capital may be loaned or rented and thus become fruitful in the hands of another the rent of land does not differ essentially in its nature from the rent of buildings in cities or from the interest of money    henry george admits ricardos law of rent to its full extent but very curiously says    irrespective of the increase of population the effect of improvements in methods of production and exchange is to increase rent .... <\s>
<s> the effect of labor saving improvements will be to increase the production of wealth <\s>
<s> now for the production of wealth two things are required labor and land <\s>
<s> therefore the effect of labor saving improvements will be to extend the demand for land and wherever the limit of the quality of land in use is reached to bring into cultivation lands of less natural productiveness or to extend cultivation on the same lands to a point of lower natural productiveness <\s>
<s> and thus while the primary effect of labor saving improvements is to increase the power of labor the secondary effect is to extend cultivation and where this lowers the margin of cultivation to increase rent    185 francis bowen 186 rejects ricardos law and says    rent depends not on the increase but on the distribution of the populationasserting that the existence of large cities and towns determines the amount of rent paid by neighboring land 187   6 <\s>
<s> rent does not enter into the cost of production of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent does not really form any part of the expenses of agricultural production or of the advances of the capitalist <\s>
<s> the grounds on which this assertion was made are now apparent <\s>
<s> it is true that all tenant farmers and many other classes of producers pay rent <\s>
<s> but we have now seen that whoever cultivates land paying a rent for it gets in return for his rent an instrument of superior power to other instruments of the same kind for which no rent is paid <\s>
<s> the superiority of the instrument is in exact proportion to the rent paid for it <\s>
<s> if a few persons had steam engines of superior power to all others in existence but limited by physical laws to a number short of the demand the rent which a manufacturer would be willing to pay for one of these steam engines could not be looked upon as an addition to his outlay because by the use of it he would save in his other expenses the equivalent of what it cost him without it he could not do the same quantity of work unless at an additional expense equal to the rent <\s>
<s> the same thing is true of land <\s>
<s> the real expenses of production are those incurred on the worst land or by the capital employed in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> this land or capital pays as we have seen no rent but the expenses to which it is subject cause all other land or agricultural capital to be subjected to an equivalent expense in the form of rent <\s>
<s> whoever does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantages and the rent which he pays does not place him in a worse position than but only in the same position as his fellow producer who pays no rent but whose instrument is one of inferior efficiency <\s>
<s> soils are of every grade some which if cultivated might replace the capital but give no profit some give a slight but not an ordinary profit some the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> that is    there is a point up to which it is profitable to cultivate and beyond which it is not profitable to cultivate <\s>
<s> the price of corn will not for any long time remain at a higher rate than is sufficient to cover with ordinary profit the cost of that portion of the general crop which is raised at greatest expense    188 for similar reasons the price will not remain at a lower rate <\s>
<s> if then the cost of production of grain is determined by that land which replaces the capital yields only the ordinary profit and pays no rent rent forms no part of this cost since that land does not and can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> mcleod 189 however says it is not the cost of production which regulates the value of agricultural produce but the value which regulates the cost <\s>
<s> definitions of value in use exchange value and price <\s>
<s> it is evident that of the two great departments of political economy the production of wealth and its distribution the consideration of value has to do with the latter alone and with that only so far as competition and not usage or custom is the distributing agency <\s>
<s> the use of a thing in political economy means its capacity to satisfy a desire or serve a purpose <\s>
<s> diamonds have this capacity in a high degree and unless they had it would not bear any price <\s>
<s> value in use or as mr <\s>
<s> de quincey calls it teleologic value is the extreme limit of value in exchange <\s>
<s> the exchange value of a thing may fall short to any amount of its value in use but that it can ever exceed the value in use implies a contradiction it supposes that persons will give to possess a thing more than the utmost value which they themselves put upon it as a means of gratifying their inclinations <\s>
<s> the word value when used without adjunct always means in political economy value in exchange <\s>
<s> exchange value requires to be distinguished from price <\s>
<s> writers have employed price to express the value of a thing in relation to moneythe quantity of money for which it will exchange <\s>
<s> moreover suppose that lands down to grade three paid rent when a took the farm now if the price of produce rises slightly grade four may pay something but possibly not enough to warrant any rent going to a landlord <\s>
<s> a will put capital on it for this return but certainly not until the price warrants it that is not until the price will return him at least the cost of working the land plus the profit on his outlay <\s>
<s> but the community needed this land or the price would not have gone up to the point which makes possible its cultivation even for a profit without rent <\s>
<s> there must always be somewhere some land affected in just this way <\s>
<s>    or to the capital employed in the least advantageous circumstances <\s>
<s> let us however suppose that there were a validity in this objection which can by no means be conceded to it that when the demand of the community had forced up food to such a price as would remunerate the expense of producing it from a certain quality of soil it happened nevertheless that all the soil of that quality was withheld from cultivation the increase of produce which the wants of society required would for the time be obtained wholly as it always is partially not by an extension of cultivation but by an increased application of labor and capital to land already cultivated <\s>
<s> now we have already seen that this increased application of capital other things being unaltered is always attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> the rise of price enables measures to be taken for increasing the produce which could not have been taken with profit at the previous price <\s>
<s> the farmer uses more expensive manures or manures land which he formerly left to nature or procures lime or marl from a distance as a dressing for the soil or pulverizes or weeds it more thoroughly or drains irrigates or subsoils portions of it which at former prices would not have paid the cost of the operation and so forth <\s>
<s> the farmer or improver will only consider whether the outlay he makes for the purpose will be returned to him with the ordinary profit and not whether any surplus will remain for rent <\s>
<s> even therefore if it were the fact that there is never any land taken into cultivation for which rent and that too of an amount worth taking into consideration was not paid it would be true nevertheless that there is always some agricultural capital which pays no rent because it returns nothing beyond the ordinary rate of profit this capital being the portion of capital last appliedthat to which the last addition to the produce was due or to express the essentials of the case in one phrase that which is applied in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> but the same amount of demand and the same price which enable this least productive portion of capital barely to replace itself with the ordinary profit enable every other portion to yield a surplus proportioned to the advantage it possesses <\s>
<s> and this surplus it is which competition enables the landlord to appropriate <\s>
<s> if land were all occupied and of only one grade the first installment of labor and capital produced we will say twenty bushels of wheat when the price of wheat rose and it became profitable to resort to greater expense on the soil a second installment of the same amount of labor and capital when applied however only yielded fifteen bushels more a third ten bushels more and a fourth five bushels more <\s>
<s> the soil now gives fifty bushels only under the highest pressure <\s>
<s> but if it was profitable to invest the same installment of labor and capital simply for the five bushels that at first had received a return of twenty bushels the price must have gone up so that five bushels should sell for as much as the twenty did formerly so mutatis mutandis of installments second and third <\s>
<s> so that if the demand is such as to require all of the fifty bushels the agricultural capital which produced the five bushels will be the standard according to which the rent of the capital which grew twenty fifteen and ten bushels respectively is measured <\s>
<s> the principle is exactly the same as if equal installments of capital and labor were invested on four different grades of land returning twenty fifteen ten and five bushels for each installment <\s>
<s> or as if in the table on page 240 a b c and d each represented different installments of the same amount of labor and capital put upon the same spot of ground instead of being as there put upon different grades of land <\s>
<s> the rent of all land is measured by the excess of the return to the whole capital employed on it above what is necessary to replace the capital with the ordinary rate of profit or in other words above what the same capital would yield if it were all employed in as disadvantageous circumstances as the least productive portion of it whether that least productive portion of capital is rendered so by being employed on the worst soil or by being expended in extorting more produce from land which already yielded as much as it could be made to part with on easier terms <\s>
<s> it will be true that the farmer requires the ordinary rate of profit on the whole of his capital that whatever it returns to him beyond this he is obliged to pay to the landlord but will not consent to pay more that there is a portion of capital applied to agriculture in such circumstances of productiveness as to yield only the ordinary profits and that the difference between the produce of this and of any other capital of similar amount is the measure of the tribute which that other capital can and will pay under the name of rent to the landlord <\s>
<s> this constitutes a law of rent as near the truth as such a law can possibly be though of course modified or disturbed in individual cases by pending contracts individual miscalculations the influence of habit and even the particular feelings and dispositions of the persons concerned <\s>
<s> the law of rent in the economic sense operates in the united states as truly as elsewhere although there is no separate class of landlords here <\s>
<s> with us almost all land is owned by the cultivator so that two functions those of the landlord and farmer are both united in one person <\s>
<s> although one payment is made it is still just as distinctly made up of two parts one of which is a payment to the owner for the superior quality of his soil and the other a payment to the same person if the owner is the cultivator of profit on the farmers working capital <\s>
<s> land which in the united states will only return enough to pay a profit on this capital can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> and land which can pay more than a profit on this working capital returns that excess as rent even if the farmer is also the owner and landlord <\s>
<s> the principle which regulates the amount of that excesswhich is the essential pointis the principle which determines the amount of economic rent and it holds true in the united states or finland provided only that different grades of land are called into cultivation <\s>
<s> the governing principle is the same no matter whether a payment is made to one man as profit and to another as rent or whether the two payments are made to the same man in two capacities <\s>
<s> it has been urged that the law of rent does not hold in the united states because    the price of grain and other agricultural produce has not risen in proportion to the increase of our numbers as it ought to have done if ricardos theory were true but has fallen since 1830 though since that time our population has been more than tripled    181 this overlooks the fact that we have not even yet taken up all our best agricultural lands so that for some products the law of diminishing productiveness has not yet shown itself <\s>
<s> the reason is that the extension of our railway system has only of late years brought the really good grain lands into cultivation <\s>
<s> the fact that there has been no rise in agricultural products is due to the enormous extent of marvelously fertile grain lands in the west and to the cheapness of transportation from those districts to the seaboard <\s>
<s> for a general understanding of the law of rent the following table will show how under constant increase of population represented by four different advances of population in the first column first the best and then the poorer lands are brought into cultivation <\s>
<s> we will suppose 1 that the most fertile land a at first pays no rent then 2 when more food is wanted than land a can supply it will be profitable to till land b but which as yet pays no rent <\s>

<s> opposing views of the law of rent <\s>
<s> under the name of rent many payments are commonly included which are not a remuneration for the original powers of the land itself but for capital expended on it <\s>
<s> the buildings are as distinct a thing from the farm as the stock or the timber on it and what is paid for them can no more be called rent of land than a payment for cattle would be if it were the custom that the landlord should stock the farm for the tenant <\s>
<s> the buildings like the cattle are not land but capital regularly consumed and reproduced and all payments made in consideration for them are properly interest <\s>
<s> but with regard to capital actually sunk in improvements and not requiring periodical renewal but spent once for all in giving the land a permanent increase of productiveness it appears to me that the return made to such capital loses altogether the character of profits and is governed by the principles of rent <\s>
<s> it is true that a landlord will not expend capital in improving his estate unless he expects from the improvement an increase of income surpassing the interest of his outlay <\s>
<s> prospectively this increase of income may be regarded as profit but when the expense has been incurred and the improvement made the rent of the improved land is governed by the same rules as that of the unimproved <\s>
<s> carey as well as bastiat has declared that there is a law of increasing returns from land <\s>
<s> he points out that everything now existing could be reproduced to day at a less cost than that involved in its original production owing to our advance in skill knowledge and all the arts of production that for example it costs less to make an axe now than it did five hundred years ago so also with a farm since a farm of a given amount of productiveness can be brought into cultivation at less cost to day than that originally spent upon it <\s>
<s> the gain of society has we all admit been such that we produce almost everything at a less cost now than long ago but to class a farm and an axe together overlooks in the most remarkable way the fact that land can not be created by labor and capital while axes can and that too indefinitely <\s>
<s> nor can the produce from the land be increased indefinitely at a diminishing cost <\s>
<s> this is sometimes denied by the appeal to facts    it can be abundantly proved that if we take any two periods sufficiently distant to afford a fair test whether fifty or one hundred or five hundred years the production of the land relatively to the labor employed upon it has progressively become greater and greater    182 but this does not prove that an existing tendency to diminishing returns has not been more than offset by the progress of the arts and improvements <\s>
<s>    the advance of a ship against wind and tide is no proof that there is no wind and tide    in a work entitled    the past the present and the future    mr <\s>
<s> carey takes a ground of objection to the ricardo theory of rent namely that in point of historical fact the lands first brought under cultivation are not the most fertile but the barren lands <\s>
<s>    we find the settler invariably occupying the high and thin lands requiring little clearing and no drainage <\s>
<s> with the growth of population and wealth other soils yielding a larger return to labor are always brought into activity with a constantly increasing return to the labor expended upon them    in whatever order the lands come into cultivation those which when cultivated yield the least return in proportion to the labor required for their culture will always regulate the price of agricultural produce and all other lands will pay a rent simply equivalent to the excess of their produce over this minimum <\s>
<s> whatever unguarded expressions may have been occasionally used in describing the law of rent these two propositions are all that was ever intended by it <\s>
<s> carey could show that the return to labor from the land agricultural skill and science being supposed the same is not a diminishing return he would overthrow a principle much more fundamental than any law of rent <\s>
<s> but in this he has wholly failed <\s>
<s> another objection taken against the law of diminishing returns and so against the law of rent is that the potential increase of food e g of a grain of wheat is far greater than that of man 183 no one disputes the fact that one grain of wheat can reproduce itself more times than man and that too in a geometric increase but not without land <\s>
<s> a grain of wheat needs land in which it can multiply itself and this necessary element of its increase is limited and it is the very thing which limits the multiplication of the grains of wheat <\s>
<s> on the same piece of land one can not get more than what comes from one act of reproduction in the grain <\s>
<s> if one grain produces 100 of its kind doubling the capital will not repeatedly cause a geometric increase in the ratio of reproduction of each grain on this same land so that one grain by one process produces of its kind 200 400 800 or 1,600 because you can not multiply the land in any such ratio as would accompany this potential reduplication of the grain <\s>
<s> this objection would not seem worth answering were it not that it furnishes some difficulty to really honest inquirers <\s>
<s> others again allege as an objection against ricardo that if all land were of equal fertility it might still yield a rent <\s>
<s> but ricardo says precisely the same <\s>

<s> it is true that a landlord will not expend capital in improving his estate unless he expects from the improvement an increase of income surpassing the interest of his outlay <\s>
<s> prospectively this increase of income may be regarded as profit but when the expense has been incurred and the improvement made the rent of the improved land is governed by the same rules as that of the unimproved <\s>
<s> carey as well as bastiat has declared that there is a law of increasing returns from land <\s>
<s> he points out that everything now existing could be reproduced to day at a less cost than that involved in its original production owing to our advance in skill knowledge and all the arts of production that for example it costs less to make an axe now than it did five hundred years ago so also with a farm since a farm of a given amount of productiveness can be brought into cultivation at less cost to day than that originally spent upon it <\s>
<s> the gain of society has we all admit been such that we produce almost everything at a less cost now than long ago but to class a farm and an axe together overlooks in the most remarkable way the fact that land can not be created by labor and capital while axes can and that too indefinitely <\s>
<s> nor can the produce from the land be increased indefinitely at a diminishing cost <\s>
<s> this is sometimes denied by the appeal to facts    it can be abundantly proved that if we take any two periods sufficiently distant to afford a fair test whether fifty or one hundred or five hundred years the production of the land relatively to the labor employed upon it has progressively become greater and greater    182 but this does not prove that an existing tendency to diminishing returns has not been more than offset by the progress of the arts and improvements <\s>
<s>    the advance of a ship against wind and tide is no proof that there is no wind and tide    in a work entitled    the past the present and the future    mr <\s>
<s> carey takes a ground of objection to the ricardo theory of rent namely that in point of historical fact the lands first brought under cultivation are not the most fertile but the barren lands <\s>
<s>    we find the settler invariably occupying the high and thin lands requiring little clearing and no drainage <\s>
<s> with the growth of population and wealth other soils yielding a larger return to labor are always brought into activity with a constantly increasing return to the labor expended upon them    in whatever order the lands come into cultivation those which when cultivated yield the least return in proportion to the labor required for their culture will always regulate the price of agricultural produce and all other lands will pay a rent simply equivalent to the excess of their produce over this minimum <\s>
<s> whatever unguarded expressions may have been occasionally used in describing the law of rent these two propositions are all that was ever intended by it <\s>
<s> carey could show that the return to labor from the land agricultural skill and science being supposed the same is not a diminishing return he would overthrow a principle much more fundamental than any law of rent <\s>
<s> but in this he has wholly failed <\s>
<s> another objection taken against the law of diminishing returns and so against the law of rent is that the potential increase of food e g of a grain of wheat is far greater than that of man 183 no one disputes the fact that one grain of wheat can reproduce itself more times than man and that too in a geometric increase but not without land <\s>
<s> a grain of wheat needs land in which it can multiply itself and this necessary element of its increase is limited and it is the very thing which limits the multiplication of the grains of wheat <\s>
<s> on the same piece of land one can not get more than what comes from one act of reproduction in the grain <\s>
<s> if one grain produces 100 of its kind doubling the capital will not repeatedly cause a geometric increase in the ratio of reproduction of each grain on this same land so that one grain by one process produces of its kind 200 400 800 or 1,600 because you can not multiply the land in any such ratio as would accompany this potential reduplication of the grain <\s>
<s> this objection would not seem worth answering were it not that it furnishes some difficulty to really honest inquirers <\s>
<s> others again allege as an objection against ricardo that if all land were of equal fertility it might still yield a rent <\s>
<s> but ricardo says precisely the same <\s>
<s> it is also distinctly a portion of ricardos doctrine that even apart from differences of situation the land of a country supposed to be of uniform fertility would all of it on a certain supposition pay rent namely if the demand of the community required that it should all be cultivated and cultivated beyond the point at which a further application of capital begins to be attended with a smaller proportional return <\s>
<s> this is simply the question before discussed whether if only one class of land were cultivated some agricultural capital would pay rent or not <\s>
<s> it all depends on the fact whether populationand so the demand for foodhas increased to the point where it calls out a recognition of the diminishing productiveness of the soil <\s>
<s> in that case different capitals would be invested so that there would be different returns to the same amount of capital and the prior or more advantageous investments of capital on the land would yield more than the ordinary rate of profit which could be claimed as rent <\s>
<s> perry 184 admits the law of diminishing returns but holds that    as land is capital and as every form of capital may be loaned or rented and thus become fruitful in the hands of another the rent of land does not differ essentially in its nature from the rent of buildings in cities or from the interest of money    henry george admits ricardos law of rent to its full extent but very curiously says    irrespective of the increase of population the effect of improvements in methods of production and exchange is to increase rent .... <\s>
<s> the effect of labor saving improvements will be to increase the production of wealth <\s>
<s> now for the production of wealth two things are required labor and land <\s>
<s> therefore the effect of labor saving improvements will be to extend the demand for land and wherever the limit of the quality of land in use is reached to bring into cultivation lands of less natural productiveness or to extend cultivation on the same lands to a point of lower natural productiveness <\s>
<s> and thus while the primary effect of labor saving improvements is to increase the power of labor the secondary effect is to extend cultivation and where this lowers the margin of cultivation to increase rent    185 francis bowen 186 rejects ricardos law and says    rent depends not on the increase but on the distribution of the populationasserting that the existence of large cities and towns determines the amount of rent paid by neighboring land 187   6 <\s>
<s> rent does not enter into the cost of production of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> rent does not really form any part of the expenses of agricultural production or of the advances of the capitalist <\s>
<s> the grounds on which this assertion was made are now apparent <\s>
<s> it is true that all tenant farmers and many other classes of producers pay rent <\s>
<s> but we have now seen that whoever cultivates land paying a rent for it gets in return for his rent an instrument of superior power to other instruments of the same kind for which no rent is paid <\s>
<s> the superiority of the instrument is in exact proportion to the rent paid for it <\s>
<s> if a few persons had steam engines of superior power to all others in existence but limited by physical laws to a number short of the demand the rent which a manufacturer would be willing to pay for one of these steam engines could not be looked upon as an addition to his outlay because by the use of it he would save in his other expenses the equivalent of what it cost him without it he could not do the same quantity of work unless at an additional expense equal to the rent <\s>
<s> the same thing is true of land <\s>
<s> the real expenses of production are those incurred on the worst land or by the capital employed in the least favorable circumstances <\s>
<s> this land or capital pays as we have seen no rent but the expenses to which it is subject cause all other land or agricultural capital to be subjected to an equivalent expense in the form of rent <\s>
<s> whoever does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantages and the rent which he pays does not place him in a worse position than but only in the same position as his fellow producer who pays no rent but whose instrument is one of inferior efficiency <\s>
<s> soils are of every grade some which if cultivated might replace the capital but give no profit some give a slight but not an ordinary profit some the ordinary profit <\s>
<s> that is    there is a point up to which it is profitable to cultivate and beyond which it is not profitable to cultivate <\s>
<s> the price of corn will not for any long time remain at a higher rate than is sufficient to cover with ordinary profit the cost of that portion of the general crop which is raised at greatest expense    188 for similar reasons the price will not remain at a lower rate <\s>
<s> if then the cost of production of grain is determined by that land which replaces the capital yields only the ordinary profit and pays no rent rent forms no part of this cost since that land does not and can not pay any rent <\s>
<s> mcleod 189 however says it is not the cost of production which regulates the value of agricultural produce but the value which regulates the cost <\s>
<s> definitions of value in use exchange value and price <\s>
<s> it is evident that of the two great departments of political economy the production of wealth and its distribution the consideration of value has to do with the latter alone and with that only so far as competition and not usage or custom is the distributing agency <\s>
<s> the use of a thing in political economy means its capacity to satisfy a desire or serve a purpose <\s>
<s> diamonds have this capacity in a high degree and unless they had it would not bear any price <\s>
<s> value in use or as mr <\s>
<s> de quincey calls it teleologic value is the extreme limit of value in exchange <\s>
<s> the exchange value of a thing may fall short to any amount of its value in use but that it can ever exceed the value in use implies a contradiction it supposes that persons will give to possess a thing more than the utmost value which they themselves put upon it as a means of gratifying their inclinations <\s>
<s> the word value when used without adjunct always means in political economy value in exchange <\s>
<s> exchange value requires to be distinguished from price <\s>
<s> writers have employed price to express the value of a thing in relation to moneythe quantity of money for which it will exchange <\s>

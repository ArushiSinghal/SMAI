<s> when metallic money had been entirely superseded and expelled from circulation by the substitution of an equal amount of bank notes any attempt to keep a still further quantity of paper in circulation must if the notes are convertible into gold be a complete failure <\s>
<s> this brings up the whole question at issue between the    currency principle    and the    banking principle    the latter maintained by fullerton wilson price and tooke in his later writings held that if notes were convertible the value of notes could not differ from the value of the metal into which they were convertible while the former advocated by lord overstone g <\s>

<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>
<s> suppose that some american production could be bought while the currency was still metallic for 25 and sold in england for 27.50 the difference covering the expense and risk and affording a profit to the merchant <\s>
<s> on account of the depreciation this commodity will now cost in the united states 30 and can not be sold in england for more than 27.50 and yet it will be exported as before <\s>
<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>
<s> but though the trade is not affected the exchanges are <\s>
<s> when the imports and exports are in equilibrium the exchange in a metallic currency would be at par a bill on england for the equivalent of 25 would be worth 25 <\s>
<s> but 25 or the quantity of gold contained in them having come to be worth in the united states 30 it follows that a bill on england for 25 will be worth 30 <\s>
<s> when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation <\s>
<s> if the currency is depreciated 10 15 or 20 per cent then in whatever way the real exchange arising from the variations of international debts and credits may vary the quoted exchange will always differ 10 15 or 20 per cent from it <\s>
<s> however high this nominal premium may be it has no tendency to send gold out of the country for the purpose of drawing a bill against it and profiting by the premium because the gold so sent must be procured not from the banks and at par as in the case of a convertible currency but in the market at an advance of price equal to the premium <\s>
<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>
<s> since the amount of depreciation is exactly measured by the degree in which the market price of bullion exceeds the mint valuation we have a sure criterion to determine what portion of the quoted exchange being referable to depreciation may be struck off as nominal the result so corrected expressing the real exchange <\s>
<s> the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency <\s>
<s> whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit money prices rise just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money <\s>
<s> all the effects therefore must be similar <\s>
<s> as a consequence of high prices exportation is checked and importation stimulated though in fact the increase of importation seldom waits for the rise of prices which is the consequence of speculation inasmuch as some of the great articles of import are usually among the things in which speculative overtrading first shows itself <\s>
<s> there is therefore in such periods usually a great excess of imports over exports and when the time comes at which these must be paid for the exchanges become unfavorable and gold flows out of the country <\s>
<s> this efflux of gold takes effect on prices by withdrawing gold from the reserves of the banks and so by stopping loans and the use of credit or purchasing power ]: its effect is to make them recoil downward <\s>
<s> the recoil once begun generally becomes a total rout and the unusual extension of credit is rapidly exchanged for an unusual contraction of it <\s>
<s> accordingly when credit has been imprudently stretched and the speculative spirit carried to excess the turn of the exchanges and consequent pressure on the banks to obtain gold for exportation are generally the proximate cause of the catastrophe <\s>

<s> after the war and until 1873 while the united states was under the influence of high prices and a speculation which has been seldom equaled in our history the resulting great excess of imports became very striking <\s>
<s> it was an unhealthy and abnormal condition of trade <\s>

<s> the effect on international trade of a collapse of credit is thus clearly marked by the lines on the chart <\s>
<s> of the rate of interest <\s>
<s> the rate of interest depends on the demand and supply of loans <\s>
<s> the two topics of currency and loans though in themselves distinct are so intimately blended in the phenomena of what is called the money market that it is impossible to understand the one without the other and in many minds the two subjects are mixed up in the most inextricable confusion <\s>
<s> in the preceding book 285 we defined the relation in which interest stands to profit <\s>
<s> we found that the gross profit of capital might be distinguished into three parts which are respectively the remuneration for risk for trouble and for the capital itself and may be termed insurance wages of superintendence and interest <\s>
<s> after making compensation for risk that is after covering the average losses to which capital is exposed either by the general circumstances of society or by the hazards of the particular employment there remains a surplus which partly goes to repay the owner of the capital for his abstinence and partly the employer of it for his time and trouble <\s>
<s> how much goes to the one and how much to the other is shown by the amount of the remuneration which when the two functions are separated the owner of capital can obtain from the employer for its use <\s>
<s> this is evidently a question of demand and supply <\s>
<s> nor have demand and supply any different meaning or effect in this case from what they have in all others <\s>
<s> the rate of interest will be such as to equalize the demand for loans with the supply of them <\s>
<s> it will be such that exactly as much as some people are desirous to borrow at that rate others shall be willing to lend <\s>
<s> if there is more offered than demanded interest will fall if more is demanded than offered it will rise and in both cases to the point at which the equation of supply and demand is re established <\s>
<s> the desire to borrow and the willingness to lend are more or less influenced by every circumstance which affects the state or prospects of industry or commerce either generally or in any of their branches <\s>
<s> the rate of interest therefore on good security which alone we have here to consider for interest in which considerations of risk bear a part may swell to any amount is seldom in the great centers of money transactions precisely the same for two days together as is shown by the never ceasing variations in the quoted prices of the funds and other negotiable securities <\s>
<s> nevertheless there must be as in other cases of value some rate which in the language of adam smith and ricardo may be called the natural rate some rate about which the market rate oscillates and to which it always tends to return <\s>
<s> this rate partly depends on the amount of accumulation going on in the hands of persons who can not themselves attend to the employment of their savings and partly on the comparative taste existing in the community for the active pursuits of industry or for the leisure ease and independence of an annuitant <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the permanent demand and supply of loans <\s>
<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>
<s> these are naturally borrowers and the amount which they desire to borrow and can give security for constitutes the demand for loans on account of productive employment <\s>
<s> to these must be added the loans required by government and by land owners or other unproductive consumers who have good security to give <\s>
<s> this constitutes the mass of loans for which there is an habitual demand <\s>
<s> now it is conceivable that there might exist in the hands of persons disinclined or disqualified for engaging personally in business 1 a mass of capital equal to and even exceeding this demand <\s>
<s> in that case there would be an habitual excess of competition on the part of lenders and the rate of interest would bear a low proportion to the rate of profit <\s>
<s> interest would be forced down to the point which would either tempt borrowers to take a greater amount of loans than they had a reasonable expectation of being able to employ in their business or would so discourage a portion of the lenders as to make them either forbear to accumulate or endeavor to increase their income by engaging in business on their own account and incurring the risks if not the labors of industrial employment <\s>
<s> the low rates of interest rather tempt people to take some additional risk and enter into investments which offer a higher rate of dividends so that a period of low interest is a time when speculative enterprises find victims and then by bad and worthless investments much of the loanable funds is actually lost thereby reducing the total quantity of loans more nearly to that demand which will give an ordinary rate of interest <\s>
<s> 2 on the other hand the capital owned by persons who prefer lending it at interest or whose avocations prevent them from personally superintending its employment may be short of the habitual demand for loans <\s>
<s> it may be in great part absorbed by the investments afforded by the public debt and by mortgages and the remainder may not be sufficient to supply the wants of commerce <\s>
<s> if so the rate of interest will be raised so high as in some way to re establish the equilibrium <\s>
<s> when there is only a small difference between interest and profit many borrowers may no longer be willing to increase their responsibilities and involve their credit for so small a remuneration or some who would otherwise have engaged in business may prefer leisure and become lenders instead of borrowers or others under the inducement of high interest and easy investment for their capital may retire from business earlier and with smaller fortunes than they otherwise would have done <\s>
<s> or lastly instead of capital being afforded by persons not in business the affording it may itself become a business <\s>
<s> a portion of the capital employed in trade may be supplied by a class of professional money lenders <\s>

<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>
<s> suppose that some american production could be bought while the currency was still metallic for 25 and sold in england for 27.50 the difference covering the expense and risk and affording a profit to the merchant <\s>
<s> on account of the depreciation this commodity will now cost in the united states 30 and can not be sold in england for more than 27.50 and yet it will be exported as before <\s>
<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>
<s> but though the trade is not affected the exchanges are <\s>
<s> when the imports and exports are in equilibrium the exchange in a metallic currency would be at par a bill on england for the equivalent of 25 would be worth 25 <\s>
<s> but 25 or the quantity of gold contained in them having come to be worth in the united states 30 it follows that a bill on england for 25 will be worth 30 <\s>
<s> when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation <\s>
<s> if the currency is depreciated 10 15 or 20 per cent then in whatever way the real exchange arising from the variations of international debts and credits may vary the quoted exchange will always differ 10 15 or 20 per cent from it <\s>
<s> however high this nominal premium may be it has no tendency to send gold out of the country for the purpose of drawing a bill against it and profiting by the premium because the gold so sent must be procured not from the banks and at par as in the case of a convertible currency but in the market at an advance of price equal to the premium <\s>
<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>
<s> since the amount of depreciation is exactly measured by the degree in which the market price of bullion exceeds the mint valuation we have a sure criterion to determine what portion of the quoted exchange being referable to depreciation may be struck off as nominal the result so corrected expressing the real exchange <\s>
<s> the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency <\s>
<s> whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit money prices rise just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money <\s>
<s> all the effects therefore must be similar <\s>
<s> as a consequence of high prices exportation is checked and importation stimulated though in fact the increase of importation seldom waits for the rise of prices which is the consequence of speculation inasmuch as some of the great articles of import are usually among the things in which speculative overtrading first shows itself <\s>
<s> there is therefore in such periods usually a great excess of imports over exports and when the time comes at which these must be paid for the exchanges become unfavorable and gold flows out of the country <\s>

<s> the rate of interest depends on the demand and supply of loans <\s>
<s> the two topics of currency and loans though in themselves distinct are so intimately blended in the phenomena of what is called the money market that it is impossible to understand the one without the other and in many minds the two subjects are mixed up in the most inextricable confusion <\s>
<s> in the preceding book 285 we defined the relation in which interest stands to profit <\s>
<s> we found that the gross profit of capital might be distinguished into three parts which are respectively the remuneration for risk for trouble and for the capital itself and may be termed insurance wages of superintendence and interest <\s>
<s> after making compensation for risk that is after covering the average losses to which capital is exposed either by the general circumstances of society or by the hazards of the particular employment there remains a surplus which partly goes to repay the owner of the capital for his abstinence and partly the employer of it for his time and trouble <\s>
<s> how much goes to the one and how much to the other is shown by the amount of the remuneration which when the two functions are separated the owner of capital can obtain from the employer for its use <\s>
<s> this is evidently a question of demand and supply <\s>
<s> nor have demand and supply any different meaning or effect in this case from what they have in all others <\s>
<s> the rate of interest will be such as to equalize the demand for loans with the supply of them <\s>
<s> it will be such that exactly as much as some people are desirous to borrow at that rate others shall be willing to lend <\s>
<s> if there is more offered than demanded interest will fall if more is demanded than offered it will rise and in both cases to the point at which the equation of supply and demand is re established <\s>
<s> the desire to borrow and the willingness to lend are more or less influenced by every circumstance which affects the state or prospects of industry or commerce either generally or in any of their branches <\s>
<s> the rate of interest therefore on good security which alone we have here to consider for interest in which considerations of risk bear a part may swell to any amount is seldom in the great centers of money transactions precisely the same for two days together as is shown by the never ceasing variations in the quoted prices of the funds and other negotiable securities <\s>
<s> nevertheless there must be as in other cases of value some rate which in the language of adam smith and ricardo may be called the natural rate some rate about which the market rate oscillates and to which it always tends to return <\s>
<s> this rate partly depends on the amount of accumulation going on in the hands of persons who can not themselves attend to the employment of their savings and partly on the comparative taste existing in the community for the active pursuits of industry or for the leisure ease and independence of an annuitant <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the permanent demand and supply of loans <\s>
<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>
<s> these are naturally borrowers and the amount which they desire to borrow and can give security for constitutes the demand for loans on account of productive employment <\s>
<s> to these must be added the loans required by government and by land owners or other unproductive consumers who have good security to give <\s>
<s> this constitutes the mass of loans for which there is an habitual demand <\s>
<s> now it is conceivable that there might exist in the hands of persons disinclined or disqualified for engaging personally in business 1 a mass of capital equal to and even exceeding this demand <\s>
<s> in that case there would be an habitual excess of competition on the part of lenders and the rate of interest would bear a low proportion to the rate of profit <\s>
<s> interest would be forced down to the point which would either tempt borrowers to take a greater amount of loans than they had a reasonable expectation of being able to employ in their business or would so discourage a portion of the lenders as to make them either forbear to accumulate or endeavor to increase their income by engaging in business on their own account and incurring the risks if not the labors of industrial employment <\s>
<s> the low rates of interest rather tempt people to take some additional risk and enter into investments which offer a higher rate of dividends so that a period of low interest is a time when speculative enterprises find victims and then by bad and worthless investments much of the loanable funds is actually lost thereby reducing the total quantity of loans more nearly to that demand which will give an ordinary rate of interest <\s>
<s> 2 on the other hand the capital owned by persons who prefer lending it at interest or whose avocations prevent them from personally superintending its employment may be short of the habitual demand for loans <\s>
<s> it may be in great part absorbed by the investments afforded by the public debt and by mortgages and the remainder may not be sufficient to supply the wants of commerce <\s>

<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>

<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>

<s> the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency <\s>
<s> whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit money prices rise just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money <\s>

<s> how much goes to the one and how much to the other is shown by the amount of the remuneration which when the two functions are separated the owner of capital can obtain from the employer for its use <\s>
<s> this is evidently a question of demand and supply <\s>

<s> nevertheless there must be as in other cases of value some rate which in the language of adam smith and ricardo may be called the natural rate some rate about which the market rate oscillates and to which it always tends to return <\s>
<s> this rate partly depends on the amount of accumulation going on in the hands of persons who can not themselves attend to the employment of their savings and partly on the comparative taste existing in the community for the active pursuits of industry or for the leisure ease and independence of an annuitant <\s>

<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>

<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>

<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>

<s> the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency <\s>

<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>

<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>

<s> the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency <\s>
<s> whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit money prices rise just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money <\s>

<s> how much goes to the one and how much to the other is shown by the amount of the remuneration which when the two functions are separated the owner of capital can obtain from the employer for its use <\s>

<s> if there is more offered than demanded interest will fall if more is demanded than offered it will rise and in both cases to the point at which the equation of supply and demand is re established <\s>
<s> the desire to borrow and the willingness to lend are more or less influenced by every circumstance which affects the state or prospects of industry or commerce either generally or in any of their branches <\s>

<s> nevertheless there must be as in other cases of value some rate which in the language of adam smith and ricardo may be called the natural rate some rate about which the market rate oscillates and to which it always tends to return <\s>

<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>

<s> to these must be added the loans required by government and by land owners or other unproductive consumers who have good security to give <\s>
<s> this constitutes the mass of loans for which there is an habitual demand <\s>
<s> now it is conceivable that there might exist in the hands of persons disinclined or disqualified for engaging personally in business 1 a mass of capital equal to and even exceeding this demand <\s>
<s> in that case there would be an habitual excess of competition on the part of lenders and the rate of interest would bear a low proportion to the rate of profit <\s>
<s> interest would be forced down to the point which would either tempt borrowers to take a greater amount of loans than they had a reasonable expectation of being able to employ in their business or would so discourage a portion of the lenders as to make them either forbear to accumulate or endeavor to increase their income by engaging in business on their own account and incurring the risks if not the labors of industrial employment <\s>
<s> the low rates of interest rather tempt people to take some additional risk and enter into investments which offer a higher rate of dividends so that a period of low interest is a time when speculative enterprises find victims and then by bad and worthless investments much of the loanable funds is actually lost thereby reducing the total quantity of loans more nearly to that demand which will give an ordinary rate of interest <\s>
<s> 2 on the other hand the capital owned by persons who prefer lending it at interest or whose avocations prevent them from personally superintending its employment may be short of the habitual demand for loans <\s>
<s> it may be in great part absorbed by the investments afforded by the public debt and by mortgages and the remainder may not be sufficient to supply the wants of commerce <\s>

<s> or lastly instead of capital being afforded by persons not in business the affording it may itself become a business <\s>

<s> real and nominal exchange <\s>
<s> when metallic money had been entirely superseded and expelled from circulation by the substitution of an equal amount of bank notes any attempt to keep a still further quantity of paper in circulation must if the notes are convertible into gold be a complete failure <\s>
<s> this brings up the whole question at issue between the    currency principle    and the    banking principle    the latter maintained by fullerton wilson price and tooke in his later writings held that if notes were convertible the value of notes could not differ from the value of the metal into which they were convertible while the former advocated by lord overstone g <\s>
<s> norman colonel torrens tooke in his earlier writings and sir robert peel implied that even a convertible paper was liable to over issues <\s>
<s> this last school brought about the bank act of 1844 284 a new issue would again set in motion the same train of consequences by which the gold coin had already been expelled <\s>
<s> the metals would as before be required for exportation and would be for that purpose demanded from the banks to the full extent of the superfluous notes which thus could not possibly be retained in circulation <\s>
<s> if indeed the notes were inconvertible there would be no such obstacle to the increase in their quantity <\s>
<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>
<s> suppose that some american production could be bought while the currency was still metallic for 25 and sold in england for 27.50 the difference covering the expense and risk and affording a profit to the merchant <\s>
<s> on account of the depreciation this commodity will now cost in the united states 30 and can not be sold in england for more than 27.50 and yet it will be exported as before <\s>
<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>
<s> but though the trade is not affected the exchanges are <\s>
<s> when the imports and exports are in equilibrium the exchange in a metallic currency would be at par a bill on england for the equivalent of 25 would be worth 25 <\s>
<s> but 25 or the quantity of gold contained in them having come to be worth in the united states 30 it follows that a bill on england for 25 will be worth 30 <\s>
<s> when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation <\s>
<s> if the currency is depreciated 10 15 or 20 per cent then in whatever way the real exchange arising from the variations of international debts and credits may vary the quoted exchange will always differ 10 15 or 20 per cent from it <\s>
<s> however high this nominal premium may be it has no tendency to send gold out of the country for the purpose of drawing a bill against it and profiting by the premium because the gold so sent must be procured not from the banks and at par as in the case of a convertible currency but in the market at an advance of price equal to the premium <\s>
<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>
<s> since the amount of depreciation is exactly measured by the degree in which the market price of bullion exceeds the mint valuation we have a sure criterion to determine what portion of the quoted exchange being referable to depreciation may be struck off as nominal the result so corrected expressing the real exchange <\s>
<s> the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency <\s>
<s> whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit money prices rise just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money <\s>
<s> all the effects therefore must be similar <\s>
<s> as a consequence of high prices exportation is checked and importation stimulated though in fact the increase of importation seldom waits for the rise of prices which is the consequence of speculation inasmuch as some of the great articles of import are usually among the things in which speculative overtrading first shows itself <\s>
<s> there is therefore in such periods usually a great excess of imports over exports and when the time comes at which these must be paid for the exchanges become unfavorable and gold flows out of the country <\s>
<s> this efflux of gold takes effect on prices by withdrawing gold from the reserves of the banks and so by stopping loans and the use of credit or purchasing power ]: its effect is to make them recoil downward <\s>
<s> the recoil once begun generally becomes a total rout and the unusual extension of credit is rapidly exchanged for an unusual contraction of it <\s>
<s> accordingly when credit has been imprudently stretched and the speculative spirit carried to excess the turn of the exchanges and consequent pressure on the banks to obtain gold for exportation are generally the proximate cause of the catastrophe <\s>
<s> a glance at chart no <\s>
<s> xiii will give illustration to the situation here described <\s>
<s> after the war and until 1873 while the united states was under the influence of high prices and a speculation which has been seldom equaled in our history the resulting great excess of imports became very striking <\s>
<s> it was an unhealthy and abnormal condition of trade <\s>
<s> the sudden reversal of the trade by the crisis in 1873 is equally striking and as prices fell exports began to increase <\s>

<s> when metallic money had been entirely superseded and expelled from circulation by the substitution of an equal amount of bank notes any attempt to keep a still further quantity of paper in circulation must if the notes are convertible into gold be a complete failure <\s>
<s> this brings up the whole question at issue between the    currency principle    and the    banking principle    the latter maintained by fullerton wilson price and tooke in his later writings held that if notes were convertible the value of notes could not differ from the value of the metal into which they were convertible while the former advocated by lord overstone g <\s>

<s> the metals would as before be required for exportation and would be for that purpose demanded from the banks to the full extent of the superfluous notes which thus could not possibly be retained in circulation <\s>
<s> if indeed the notes were inconvertible there would be no such obstacle to the increase in their quantity <\s>
<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>
<s> suppose that some american production could be bought while the currency was still metallic for 25 and sold in england for 27.50 the difference covering the expense and risk and affording a profit to the merchant <\s>
<s> on account of the depreciation this commodity will now cost in the united states 30 and can not be sold in england for more than 27.50 and yet it will be exported as before <\s>
<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>
<s> but though the trade is not affected the exchanges are <\s>
<s> when the imports and exports are in equilibrium the exchange in a metallic currency would be at par a bill on england for the equivalent of 25 would be worth 25 <\s>
<s> but 25 or the quantity of gold contained in them having come to be worth in the united states 30 it follows that a bill on england for 25 will be worth 30 <\s>
<s> when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation <\s>
<s> if the currency is depreciated 10 15 or 20 per cent then in whatever way the real exchange arising from the variations of international debts and credits may vary the quoted exchange will always differ 10 15 or 20 per cent from it <\s>
<s> however high this nominal premium may be it has no tendency to send gold out of the country for the purpose of drawing a bill against it and profiting by the premium because the gold so sent must be procured not from the banks and at par as in the case of a convertible currency but in the market at an advance of price equal to the premium <\s>
<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>
<s> since the amount of depreciation is exactly measured by the degree in which the market price of bullion exceeds the mint valuation we have a sure criterion to determine what portion of the quoted exchange being referable to depreciation may be struck off as nominal the result so corrected expressing the real exchange <\s>
<s> the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency <\s>
<s> whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit money prices rise just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money <\s>
<s> all the effects therefore must be similar <\s>
<s> as a consequence of high prices exportation is checked and importation stimulated though in fact the increase of importation seldom waits for the rise of prices which is the consequence of speculation inasmuch as some of the great articles of import are usually among the things in which speculative overtrading first shows itself <\s>
<s> there is therefore in such periods usually a great excess of imports over exports and when the time comes at which these must be paid for the exchanges become unfavorable and gold flows out of the country <\s>

<s> when metallic money had been entirely superseded and expelled from circulation by the substitution of an equal amount of bank notes any attempt to keep a still further quantity of paper in circulation must if the notes are convertible into gold be a complete failure <\s>
<s> this brings up the whole question at issue between the    currency principle    and the    banking principle    the latter maintained by fullerton wilson price and tooke in his later writings held that if notes were convertible the value of notes could not differ from the value of the metal into which they were convertible while the former advocated by lord overstone g <\s>

<s> the metals would as before be required for exportation and would be for that purpose demanded from the banks to the full extent of the superfluous notes which thus could not possibly be retained in circulation <\s>
<s> if indeed the notes were inconvertible there would be no such obstacle to the increase in their quantity <\s>
<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>
<s> suppose that some american production could be bought while the currency was still metallic for 25 and sold in england for 27.50 the difference covering the expense and risk and affording a profit to the merchant <\s>
<s> on account of the depreciation this commodity will now cost in the united states 30 and can not be sold in england for more than 27.50 and yet it will be exported as before <\s>
<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>
<s> but though the trade is not affected the exchanges are <\s>
<s> when the imports and exports are in equilibrium the exchange in a metallic currency would be at par a bill on england for the equivalent of 25 would be worth 25 <\s>
<s> but 25 or the quantity of gold contained in them having come to be worth in the united states 30 it follows that a bill on england for 25 will be worth 30 <\s>
<s> when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation <\s>
<s> if the currency is depreciated 10 15 or 20 per cent then in whatever way the real exchange arising from the variations of international debts and credits may vary the quoted exchange will always differ 10 15 or 20 per cent from it <\s>
<s> however high this nominal premium may be it has no tendency to send gold out of the country for the purpose of drawing a bill against it and profiting by the premium because the gold so sent must be procured not from the banks and at par as in the case of a convertible currency but in the market at an advance of price equal to the premium <\s>
<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>

<s> this brings up the whole question at issue between the    currency principle    and the    banking principle    the latter maintained by fullerton wilson price and tooke in his later writings held that if notes were convertible the value of notes could not differ from the value of the metal into which they were convertible while the former advocated by lord overstone g <\s>

<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>

<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>

<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>

<s> the low rates of interest rather tempt people to take some additional risk and enter into investments which offer a higher rate of dividends so that a period of low interest is a time when speculative enterprises find victims and then by bad and worthless investments much of the loanable funds is actually lost thereby reducing the total quantity of loans more nearly to that demand which will give an ordinary rate of interest <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>

<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>

<s> when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation <\s>
<s> if the currency is depreciated 10 15 or 20 per cent then in whatever way the real exchange arising from the variations of international debts and credits may vary the quoted exchange will always differ 10 15 or 20 per cent from it <\s>
<s> however high this nominal premium may be it has no tendency to send gold out of the country for the purpose of drawing a bill against it and profiting by the premium because the gold so sent must be procured not from the banks and at par as in the case of a convertible currency but in the market at an advance of price equal to the premium <\s>
<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>

<s> the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency <\s>
<s> whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit money prices rise just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money <\s>

<s> how much goes to the one and how much to the other is shown by the amount of the remuneration which when the two functions are separated the owner of capital can obtain from the employer for its use <\s>

<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>

<s> to these must be added the loans required by government and by land owners or other unproductive consumers who have good security to give <\s>
<s> this constitutes the mass of loans for which there is an habitual demand <\s>
<s> now it is conceivable that there might exist in the hands of persons disinclined or disqualified for engaging personally in business 1 a mass of capital equal to and even exceeding this demand <\s>
<s> in that case there would be an habitual excess of competition on the part of lenders and the rate of interest would bear a low proportion to the rate of profit <\s>

<s> the low rates of interest rather tempt people to take some additional risk and enter into investments which offer a higher rate of dividends so that a period of low interest is a time when speculative enterprises find victims and then by bad and worthless investments much of the loanable funds is actually lost thereby reducing the total quantity of loans more nearly to that demand which will give an ordinary rate of interest <\s>
<s> 2 on the other hand the capital owned by persons who prefer lending it at interest or whose avocations prevent them from personally superintending its employment may be short of the habitual demand for loans <\s>
<s> it may be in great part absorbed by the investments afforded by the public debt and by mortgages and the remainder may not be sufficient to supply the wants of commerce <\s>

<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>

<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>
<s> suppose that some american production could be bought while the currency was still metallic for 25 and sold in england for 27.50 the difference covering the expense and risk and affording a profit to the merchant <\s>

<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>

<s> when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>

<s> the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency <\s>
<s> whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit money prices rise just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money <\s>

<s> how much goes to the one and how much to the other is shown by the amount of the remuneration which when the two functions are separated the owner of capital can obtain from the employer for its use <\s>
<s> this is evidently a question of demand and supply <\s>

<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>

<s> to these must be added the loans required by government and by land owners or other unproductive consumers who have good security to give <\s>

<s> now it is conceivable that there might exist in the hands of persons disinclined or disqualified for engaging personally in business 1 a mass of capital equal to and even exceeding this demand <\s>
<s> in that case there would be an habitual excess of competition on the part of lenders and the rate of interest would bear a low proportion to the rate of profit <\s>

<s> the low rates of interest rather tempt people to take some additional risk and enter into investments which offer a higher rate of dividends so that a period of low interest is a time when speculative enterprises find victims and then by bad and worthless investments much of the loanable funds is actually lost thereby reducing the total quantity of loans more nearly to that demand which will give an ordinary rate of interest <\s>

<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>

<s> how much goes to the one and how much to the other is shown by the amount of the remuneration which when the two functions are separated the owner of capital can obtain from the employer for its use <\s>

<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>

<s> to these must be added the loans required by government and by land owners or other unproductive consumers who have good security to give <\s>

<s> now it is conceivable that there might exist in the hands of persons disinclined or disqualified for engaging personally in business 1 a mass of capital equal to and even exceeding this demand <\s>
<s> in that case there would be an habitual excess of competition on the part of lenders and the rate of interest would bear a low proportion to the rate of profit <\s>

<s> the low rates of interest rather tempt people to take some additional risk and enter into investments which offer a higher rate of dividends so that a period of low interest is a time when speculative enterprises find victims and then by bad and worthless investments much of the loanable funds is actually lost thereby reducing the total quantity of loans more nearly to that demand which will give an ordinary rate of interest <\s>
<s> 2 on the other hand the capital owned by persons who prefer lending it at interest or whose avocations prevent them from personally superintending its employment may be short of the habitual demand for loans <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>

<s> circumstances which determine the permanent demand and supply of loans <\s>
<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>
<s> these are naturally borrowers and the amount which they desire to borrow and can give security for constitutes the demand for loans on account of productive employment <\s>
<s> to these must be added the loans required by government and by land owners or other unproductive consumers who have good security to give <\s>
<s> this constitutes the mass of loans for which there is an habitual demand <\s>
<s> now it is conceivable that there might exist in the hands of persons disinclined or disqualified for engaging personally in business 1 a mass of capital equal to and even exceeding this demand <\s>
<s> in that case there would be an habitual excess of competition on the part of lenders and the rate of interest would bear a low proportion to the rate of profit <\s>

<s> the low rates of interest rather tempt people to take some additional risk and enter into investments which offer a higher rate of dividends so that a period of low interest is a time when speculative enterprises find victims and then by bad and worthless investments much of the loanable funds is actually lost thereby reducing the total quantity of loans more nearly to that demand which will give an ordinary rate of interest <\s>

<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>

<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>

<s> but 25 or the quantity of gold contained in them having come to be worth in the united states 30 it follows that a bill on england for 25 will be worth 30 <\s>
<s> when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation <\s>

<s> however high this nominal premium may be it has no tendency to send gold out of the country for the purpose of drawing a bill against it and profiting by the premium because the gold so sent must be procured not from the banks and at par as in the case of a convertible currency but in the market at an advance of price equal to the premium <\s>
<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>

<s> the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency <\s>
<s> whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit money prices rise just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money <\s>

<s> there is therefore in such periods usually a great excess of imports over exports and when the time comes at which these must be paid for the exchanges become unfavorable and gold flows out of the country <\s>

<s> the two topics of currency and loans though in themselves distinct are so intimately blended in the phenomena of what is called the money market that it is impossible to understand the one without the other and in many minds the two subjects are mixed up in the most inextricable confusion <\s>
<s> in the preceding book 285 we defined the relation in which interest stands to profit <\s>
<s> we found that the gross profit of capital might be distinguished into three parts which are respectively the remuneration for risk for trouble and for the capital itself and may be termed insurance wages of superintendence and interest <\s>
<s> after making compensation for risk that is after covering the average losses to which capital is exposed either by the general circumstances of society or by the hazards of the particular employment there remains a surplus which partly goes to repay the owner of the capital for his abstinence and partly the employer of it for his time and trouble <\s>
<s> how much goes to the one and how much to the other is shown by the amount of the remuneration which when the two functions are separated the owner of capital can obtain from the employer for its use <\s>
<s> this is evidently a question of demand and supply <\s>
<s> nor have demand and supply any different meaning or effect in this case from what they have in all others <\s>
<s> the rate of interest will be such as to equalize the demand for loans with the supply of them <\s>
<s> it will be such that exactly as much as some people are desirous to borrow at that rate others shall be willing to lend <\s>
<s> if there is more offered than demanded interest will fall if more is demanded than offered it will rise and in both cases to the point at which the equation of supply and demand is re established <\s>
<s> the desire to borrow and the willingness to lend are more or less influenced by every circumstance which affects the state or prospects of industry or commerce either generally or in any of their branches <\s>
<s> the rate of interest therefore on good security which alone we have here to consider for interest in which considerations of risk bear a part may swell to any amount is seldom in the great centers of money transactions precisely the same for two days together as is shown by the never ceasing variations in the quoted prices of the funds and other negotiable securities <\s>
<s> nevertheless there must be as in other cases of value some rate which in the language of adam smith and ricardo may be called the natural rate some rate about which the market rate oscillates and to which it always tends to return <\s>
<s> this rate partly depends on the amount of accumulation going on in the hands of persons who can not themselves attend to the employment of their savings and partly on the comparative taste existing in the community for the active pursuits of industry or for the leisure ease and independence of an annuitant <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the permanent demand and supply of loans <\s>
<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>
<s> these are naturally borrowers and the amount which they desire to borrow and can give security for constitutes the demand for loans on account of productive employment <\s>
<s> to these must be added the loans required by government and by land owners or other unproductive consumers who have good security to give <\s>
<s> this constitutes the mass of loans for which there is an habitual demand <\s>
<s> now it is conceivable that there might exist in the hands of persons disinclined or disqualified for engaging personally in business 1 a mass of capital equal to and even exceeding this demand <\s>
<s> in that case there would be an habitual excess of competition on the part of lenders and the rate of interest would bear a low proportion to the rate of profit <\s>
<s> interest would be forced down to the point which would either tempt borrowers to take a greater amount of loans than they had a reasonable expectation of being able to employ in their business or would so discourage a portion of the lenders as to make them either forbear to accumulate or endeavor to increase their income by engaging in business on their own account and incurring the risks if not the labors of industrial employment <\s>
<s> the low rates of interest rather tempt people to take some additional risk and enter into investments which offer a higher rate of dividends so that a period of low interest is a time when speculative enterprises find victims and then by bad and worthless investments much of the loanable funds is actually lost thereby reducing the total quantity of loans more nearly to that demand which will give an ordinary rate of interest <\s>
<s> 2 on the other hand the capital owned by persons who prefer lending it at interest or whose avocations prevent them from personally superintending its employment may be short of the habitual demand for loans <\s>
<s> it may be in great part absorbed by the investments afforded by the public debt and by mortgages and the remainder may not be sufficient to supply the wants of commerce <\s>
<s> if so the rate of interest will be raised so high as in some way to re establish the equilibrium <\s>
<s> when there is only a small difference between interest and profit many borrowers may no longer be willing to increase their responsibilities and involve their credit for so small a remuneration or some who would otherwise have engaged in business may prefer leisure and become lenders instead of borrowers or others under the inducement of high interest and easy investment for their capital may retire from business earlier and with smaller fortunes than they otherwise would have done <\s>

<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>

<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>

<s> how much goes to the one and how much to the other is shown by the amount of the remuneration which when the two functions are separated the owner of capital can obtain from the employer for its use <\s>
<s> this is evidently a question of demand and supply <\s>

<s> the rate of interest will be such as to equalize the demand for loans with the supply of them <\s>

<s> nevertheless there must be as in other cases of value some rate which in the language of adam smith and ricardo may be called the natural rate some rate about which the market rate oscillates and to which it always tends to return <\s>

<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>

<s> to these must be added the loans required by government and by land owners or other unproductive consumers who have good security to give <\s>

<s> now it is conceivable that there might exist in the hands of persons disinclined or disqualified for engaging personally in business 1 a mass of capital equal to and even exceeding this demand <\s>

<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>
<s> suppose that some american production could be bought while the currency was still metallic for 25 and sold in england for 27.50 the difference covering the expense and risk and affording a profit to the merchant <\s>
<s> on account of the depreciation this commodity will now cost in the united states 30 and can not be sold in england for more than 27.50 and yet it will be exported as before <\s>
<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>

<s> but 25 or the quantity of gold contained in them having come to be worth in the united states 30 it follows that a bill on england for 25 will be worth 30 <\s>
<s> when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation <\s>
<s> if the currency is depreciated 10 15 or 20 per cent then in whatever way the real exchange arising from the variations of international debts and credits may vary the quoted exchange will always differ 10 15 or 20 per cent from it <\s>
<s> however high this nominal premium may be it has no tendency to send gold out of the country for the purpose of drawing a bill against it and profiting by the premium because the gold so sent must be procured not from the banks and at par as in the case of a convertible currency but in the market at an advance of price equal to the premium <\s>
<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>

<s> the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency <\s>
<s> whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit money prices rise just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money <\s>

<s> as a consequence of high prices exportation is checked and importation stimulated though in fact the increase of importation seldom waits for the rise of prices which is the consequence of speculation inasmuch as some of the great articles of import are usually among the things in which speculative overtrading first shows itself <\s>
<s> there is therefore in such periods usually a great excess of imports over exports and when the time comes at which these must be paid for the exchanges become unfavorable and gold flows out of the country <\s>

<s> we found that the gross profit of capital might be distinguished into three parts which are respectively the remuneration for risk for trouble and for the capital itself and may be termed insurance wages of superintendence and interest <\s>
<s> after making compensation for risk that is after covering the average losses to which capital is exposed either by the general circumstances of society or by the hazards of the particular employment there remains a surplus which partly goes to repay the owner of the capital for his abstinence and partly the employer of it for his time and trouble <\s>
<s> how much goes to the one and how much to the other is shown by the amount of the remuneration which when the two functions are separated the owner of capital can obtain from the employer for its use <\s>
<s> this is evidently a question of demand and supply <\s>
<s> nor have demand and supply any different meaning or effect in this case from what they have in all others <\s>
<s> the rate of interest will be such as to equalize the demand for loans with the supply of them <\s>
<s> it will be such that exactly as much as some people are desirous to borrow at that rate others shall be willing to lend <\s>
<s> if there is more offered than demanded interest will fall if more is demanded than offered it will rise and in both cases to the point at which the equation of supply and demand is re established <\s>

<s> the rate of interest therefore on good security which alone we have here to consider for interest in which considerations of risk bear a part may swell to any amount is seldom in the great centers of money transactions precisely the same for two days together as is shown by the never ceasing variations in the quoted prices of the funds and other negotiable securities <\s>
<s> nevertheless there must be as in other cases of value some rate which in the language of adam smith and ricardo may be called the natural rate some rate about which the market rate oscillates and to which it always tends to return <\s>
<s> this rate partly depends on the amount of accumulation going on in the hands of persons who can not themselves attend to the employment of their savings and partly on the comparative taste existing in the community for the active pursuits of industry or for the leisure ease and independence of an annuitant <\s>

<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>

<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>

<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>

<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>
<s> suppose that some american production could be bought while the currency was still metallic for 25 and sold in england for 27.50 the difference covering the expense and risk and affording a profit to the merchant <\s>
<s> on account of the depreciation this commodity will now cost in the united states 30 and can not be sold in england for more than 27.50 and yet it will be exported as before <\s>
<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>
<s> but though the trade is not affected the exchanges are <\s>
<s> when the imports and exports are in equilibrium the exchange in a metallic currency would be at par a bill on england for the equivalent of 25 would be worth 25 <\s>
<s> but 25 or the quantity of gold contained in them having come to be worth in the united states 30 it follows that a bill on england for 25 will be worth 30 <\s>
<s> when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation <\s>
<s> if the currency is depreciated 10 15 or 20 per cent then in whatever way the real exchange arising from the variations of international debts and credits may vary the quoted exchange will always differ 10 15 or 20 per cent from it <\s>
<s> however high this nominal premium may be it has no tendency to send gold out of the country for the purpose of drawing a bill against it and profiting by the premium because the gold so sent must be procured not from the banks and at par as in the case of a convertible currency but in the market at an advance of price equal to the premium <\s>
<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>
<s> since the amount of depreciation is exactly measured by the degree in which the market price of bullion exceeds the mint valuation we have a sure criterion to determine what portion of the quoted exchange being referable to depreciation may be struck off as nominal the result so corrected expressing the real exchange <\s>
<s> the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency <\s>
<s> whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit money prices rise just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money <\s>
<s> all the effects therefore must be similar <\s>
<s> as a consequence of high prices exportation is checked and importation stimulated though in fact the increase of importation seldom waits for the rise of prices which is the consequence of speculation inasmuch as some of the great articles of import are usually among the things in which speculative overtrading first shows itself <\s>
<s> there is therefore in such periods usually a great excess of imports over exports and when the time comes at which these must be paid for the exchanges become unfavorable and gold flows out of the country <\s>
<s> this efflux of gold takes effect on prices by withdrawing gold from the reserves of the banks and so by stopping loans and the use of credit or purchasing power ]: its effect is to make them recoil downward <\s>
<s> the recoil once begun generally becomes a total rout and the unusual extension of credit is rapidly exchanged for an unusual contraction of it <\s>

<s> real and nominal exchange <\s>
<s> when metallic money had been entirely superseded and expelled from circulation by the substitution of an equal amount of bank notes any attempt to keep a still further quantity of paper in circulation must if the notes are convertible into gold be a complete failure <\s>
<s> this brings up the whole question at issue between the    currency principle    and the    banking principle    the latter maintained by fullerton wilson price and tooke in his later writings held that if notes were convertible the value of notes could not differ from the value of the metal into which they were convertible while the former advocated by lord overstone g <\s>

<s> this last school brought about the bank act of 1844 284 a new issue would again set in motion the same train of consequences by which the gold coin had already been expelled <\s>
<s> the metals would as before be required for exportation and would be for that purpose demanded from the banks to the full extent of the superfluous notes which thus could not possibly be retained in circulation <\s>
<s> if indeed the notes were inconvertible there would be no such obstacle to the increase in their quantity <\s>
<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>
<s> suppose that some american production could be bought while the currency was still metallic for 25 and sold in england for 27.50 the difference covering the expense and risk and affording a profit to the merchant <\s>
<s> on account of the depreciation this commodity will now cost in the united states 30 and can not be sold in england for more than 27.50 and yet it will be exported as before <\s>
<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>
<s> but though the trade is not affected the exchanges are <\s>
<s> when the imports and exports are in equilibrium the exchange in a metallic currency would be at par a bill on england for the equivalent of 25 would be worth 25 <\s>
<s> but 25 or the quantity of gold contained in them having come to be worth in the united states 30 it follows that a bill on england for 25 will be worth 30 <\s>
<s> when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation <\s>
<s> if the currency is depreciated 10 15 or 20 per cent then in whatever way the real exchange arising from the variations of international debts and credits may vary the quoted exchange will always differ 10 15 or 20 per cent from it <\s>
<s> however high this nominal premium may be it has no tendency to send gold out of the country for the purpose of drawing a bill against it and profiting by the premium because the gold so sent must be procured not from the banks and at par as in the case of a convertible currency but in the market at an advance of price equal to the premium <\s>
<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>
<s> since the amount of depreciation is exactly measured by the degree in which the market price of bullion exceeds the mint valuation we have a sure criterion to determine what portion of the quoted exchange being referable to depreciation may be struck off as nominal the result so corrected expressing the real exchange <\s>
<s> the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency <\s>
<s> whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit money prices rise just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money <\s>
<s> all the effects therefore must be similar <\s>
<s> as a consequence of high prices exportation is checked and importation stimulated though in fact the increase of importation seldom waits for the rise of prices which is the consequence of speculation inasmuch as some of the great articles of import are usually among the things in which speculative overtrading first shows itself <\s>
<s> there is therefore in such periods usually a great excess of imports over exports and when the time comes at which these must be paid for the exchanges become unfavorable and gold flows out of the country <\s>
<s> this efflux of gold takes effect on prices by withdrawing gold from the reserves of the banks and so by stopping loans and the use of credit or purchasing power ]: its effect is to make them recoil downward <\s>
<s> the recoil once begun generally becomes a total rout and the unusual extension of credit is rapidly exchanged for an unusual contraction of it <\s>
<s> accordingly when credit has been imprudently stretched and the speculative spirit carried to excess the turn of the exchanges and consequent pressure on the banks to obtain gold for exportation are generally the proximate cause of the catastrophe <\s>

<s> when metallic money had been entirely superseded and expelled from circulation by the substitution of an equal amount of bank notes any attempt to keep a still further quantity of paper in circulation must if the notes are convertible into gold be a complete failure <\s>
<s> this brings up the whole question at issue between the    currency principle    and the    banking principle    the latter maintained by fullerton wilson price and tooke in his later writings held that if notes were convertible the value of notes could not differ from the value of the metal into which they were convertible while the former advocated by lord overstone g <\s>

<s> this last school brought about the bank act of 1844 284 a new issue would again set in motion the same train of consequences by which the gold coin had already been expelled <\s>
<s> the metals would as before be required for exportation and would be for that purpose demanded from the banks to the full extent of the superfluous notes which thus could not possibly be retained in circulation <\s>
<s> if indeed the notes were inconvertible there would be no such obstacle to the increase in their quantity <\s>
<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>
<s> suppose that some american production could be bought while the currency was still metallic for 25 and sold in england for 27.50 the difference covering the expense and risk and affording a profit to the merchant <\s>
<s> on account of the depreciation this commodity will now cost in the united states 30 and can not be sold in england for more than 27.50 and yet it will be exported as before <\s>
<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>
<s> but though the trade is not affected the exchanges are <\s>
<s> when the imports and exports are in equilibrium the exchange in a metallic currency would be at par a bill on england for the equivalent of 25 would be worth 25 <\s>
<s> but 25 or the quantity of gold contained in them having come to be worth in the united states 30 it follows that a bill on england for 25 will be worth 30 <\s>
<s> when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation <\s>
<s> if the currency is depreciated 10 15 or 20 per cent then in whatever way the real exchange arising from the variations of international debts and credits may vary the quoted exchange will always differ 10 15 or 20 per cent from it <\s>
<s> however high this nominal premium may be it has no tendency to send gold out of the country for the purpose of drawing a bill against it and profiting by the premium because the gold so sent must be procured not from the banks and at par as in the case of a convertible currency but in the market at an advance of price equal to the premium <\s>
<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>
<s> since the amount of depreciation is exactly measured by the degree in which the market price of bullion exceeds the mint valuation we have a sure criterion to determine what portion of the quoted exchange being referable to depreciation may be struck off as nominal the result so corrected expressing the real exchange <\s>
<s> the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency <\s>
<s> whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit money prices rise just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money <\s>

<s> when metallic money had been entirely superseded and expelled from circulation by the substitution of an equal amount of bank notes any attempt to keep a still further quantity of paper in circulation must if the notes are convertible into gold be a complete failure <\s>
<s> this brings up the whole question at issue between the    currency principle    and the    banking principle    the latter maintained by fullerton wilson price and tooke in his later writings held that if notes were convertible the value of notes could not differ from the value of the metal into which they were convertible while the former advocated by lord overstone g <\s>

<s> if indeed the notes were inconvertible there would be no such obstacle to the increase in their quantity <\s>
<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>
<s> suppose that some american production could be bought while the currency was still metallic for 25 and sold in england for 27.50 the difference covering the expense and risk and affording a profit to the merchant <\s>
<s> on account of the depreciation this commodity will now cost in the united states 30 and can not be sold in england for more than 27.50 and yet it will be exported as before <\s>
<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>
<s> but though the trade is not affected the exchanges are <\s>
<s> when the imports and exports are in equilibrium the exchange in a metallic currency would be at par a bill on england for the equivalent of 25 would be worth 25 <\s>
<s> but 25 or the quantity of gold contained in them having come to be worth in the united states 30 it follows that a bill on england for 25 will be worth 30 <\s>
<s> when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation <\s>
<s> if the currency is depreciated 10 15 or 20 per cent then in whatever way the real exchange arising from the variations of international debts and credits may vary the quoted exchange will always differ 10 15 or 20 per cent from it <\s>
<s> however high this nominal premium may be it has no tendency to send gold out of the country for the purpose of drawing a bill against it and profiting by the premium because the gold so sent must be procured not from the banks and at par as in the case of a convertible currency but in the market at an advance of price equal to the premium <\s>
<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>

<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>

<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>

<s> the low rates of interest rather tempt people to take some additional risk and enter into investments which offer a higher rate of dividends so that a period of low interest is a time when speculative enterprises find victims and then by bad and worthless investments much of the loanable funds is actually lost thereby reducing the total quantity of loans more nearly to that demand which will give an ordinary rate of interest <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>

<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>

<s> when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation <\s>
<s> if the currency is depreciated 10 15 or 20 per cent then in whatever way the real exchange arising from the variations of international debts and credits may vary the quoted exchange will always differ 10 15 or 20 per cent from it <\s>
<s> however high this nominal premium may be it has no tendency to send gold out of the country for the purpose of drawing a bill against it and profiting by the premium because the gold so sent must be procured not from the banks and at par as in the case of a convertible currency but in the market at an advance of price equal to the premium <\s>
<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>

<s> the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency <\s>
<s> whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit money prices rise just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money <\s>

<s> how much goes to the one and how much to the other is shown by the amount of the remuneration which when the two functions are separated the owner of capital can obtain from the employer for its use <\s>

<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>

<s> to these must be added the loans required by government and by land owners or other unproductive consumers who have good security to give <\s>
<s> this constitutes the mass of loans for which there is an habitual demand <\s>
<s> now it is conceivable that there might exist in the hands of persons disinclined or disqualified for engaging personally in business 1 a mass of capital equal to and even exceeding this demand <\s>
<s> in that case there would be an habitual excess of competition on the part of lenders and the rate of interest would bear a low proportion to the rate of profit <\s>

<s> the low rates of interest rather tempt people to take some additional risk and enter into investments which offer a higher rate of dividends so that a period of low interest is a time when speculative enterprises find victims and then by bad and worthless investments much of the loanable funds is actually lost thereby reducing the total quantity of loans more nearly to that demand which will give an ordinary rate of interest <\s>
<s> 2 on the other hand the capital owned by persons who prefer lending it at interest or whose avocations prevent them from personally superintending its employment may be short of the habitual demand for loans <\s>
<s> it may be in great part absorbed by the investments afforded by the public debt and by mortgages and the remainder may not be sufficient to supply the wants of commerce <\s>

<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>

<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>
<s> suppose that some american production could be bought while the currency was still metallic for 25 and sold in england for 27.50 the difference covering the expense and risk and affording a profit to the merchant <\s>

<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>

<s> when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>

<s> the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency <\s>
<s> whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit money prices rise just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money <\s>

<s> how much goes to the one and how much to the other is shown by the amount of the remuneration which when the two functions are separated the owner of capital can obtain from the employer for its use <\s>
<s> this is evidently a question of demand and supply <\s>

<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>

<s> to these must be added the loans required by government and by land owners or other unproductive consumers who have good security to give <\s>

<s> now it is conceivable that there might exist in the hands of persons disinclined or disqualified for engaging personally in business 1 a mass of capital equal to and even exceeding this demand <\s>
<s> in that case there would be an habitual excess of competition on the part of lenders and the rate of interest would bear a low proportion to the rate of profit <\s>

<s> the low rates of interest rather tempt people to take some additional risk and enter into investments which offer a higher rate of dividends so that a period of low interest is a time when speculative enterprises find victims and then by bad and worthless investments much of the loanable funds is actually lost thereby reducing the total quantity of loans more nearly to that demand which will give an ordinary rate of interest <\s>

<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>

<s> how much goes to the one and how much to the other is shown by the amount of the remuneration which when the two functions are separated the owner of capital can obtain from the employer for its use <\s>

<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>

<s> to these must be added the loans required by government and by land owners or other unproductive consumers who have good security to give <\s>

<s> now it is conceivable that there might exist in the hands of persons disinclined or disqualified for engaging personally in business 1 a mass of capital equal to and even exceeding this demand <\s>
<s> in that case there would be an habitual excess of competition on the part of lenders and the rate of interest would bear a low proportion to the rate of profit <\s>

<s> the low rates of interest rather tempt people to take some additional risk and enter into investments which offer a higher rate of dividends so that a period of low interest is a time when speculative enterprises find victims and then by bad and worthless investments much of the loanable funds is actually lost thereby reducing the total quantity of loans more nearly to that demand which will give an ordinary rate of interest <\s>
<s> 2 on the other hand the capital owned by persons who prefer lending it at interest or whose avocations prevent them from personally superintending its employment may be short of the habitual demand for loans <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>

<s> circumstances which determine the permanent demand and supply of loans <\s>
<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>
<s> these are naturally borrowers and the amount which they desire to borrow and can give security for constitutes the demand for loans on account of productive employment <\s>
<s> to these must be added the loans required by government and by land owners or other unproductive consumers who have good security to give <\s>
<s> this constitutes the mass of loans for which there is an habitual demand <\s>
<s> now it is conceivable that there might exist in the hands of persons disinclined or disqualified for engaging personally in business 1 a mass of capital equal to and even exceeding this demand <\s>
<s> in that case there would be an habitual excess of competition on the part of lenders and the rate of interest would bear a low proportion to the rate of profit <\s>

<s> the low rates of interest rather tempt people to take some additional risk and enter into investments which offer a higher rate of dividends so that a period of low interest is a time when speculative enterprises find victims and then by bad and worthless investments much of the loanable funds is actually lost thereby reducing the total quantity of loans more nearly to that demand which will give an ordinary rate of interest <\s>

<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>

<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>

<s> but 25 or the quantity of gold contained in them having come to be worth in the united states 30 it follows that a bill on england for 25 will be worth 30 <\s>
<s> when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation <\s>

<s> however high this nominal premium may be it has no tendency to send gold out of the country for the purpose of drawing a bill against it and profiting by the premium because the gold so sent must be procured not from the banks and at par as in the case of a convertible currency but in the market at an advance of price equal to the premium <\s>
<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>

<s> the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency <\s>
<s> whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit money prices rise just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money <\s>

<s> there is therefore in such periods usually a great excess of imports over exports and when the time comes at which these must be paid for the exchanges become unfavorable and gold flows out of the country <\s>

<s> the two topics of currency and loans though in themselves distinct are so intimately blended in the phenomena of what is called the money market that it is impossible to understand the one without the other and in many minds the two subjects are mixed up in the most inextricable confusion <\s>
<s> in the preceding book 285 we defined the relation in which interest stands to profit <\s>
<s> we found that the gross profit of capital might be distinguished into three parts which are respectively the remuneration for risk for trouble and for the capital itself and may be termed insurance wages of superintendence and interest <\s>
<s> after making compensation for risk that is after covering the average losses to which capital is exposed either by the general circumstances of society or by the hazards of the particular employment there remains a surplus which partly goes to repay the owner of the capital for his abstinence and partly the employer of it for his time and trouble <\s>
<s> how much goes to the one and how much to the other is shown by the amount of the remuneration which when the two functions are separated the owner of capital can obtain from the employer for its use <\s>
<s> this is evidently a question of demand and supply <\s>
<s> nor have demand and supply any different meaning or effect in this case from what they have in all others <\s>
<s> the rate of interest will be such as to equalize the demand for loans with the supply of them <\s>
<s> it will be such that exactly as much as some people are desirous to borrow at that rate others shall be willing to lend <\s>
<s> if there is more offered than demanded interest will fall if more is demanded than offered it will rise and in both cases to the point at which the equation of supply and demand is re established <\s>
<s> the desire to borrow and the willingness to lend are more or less influenced by every circumstance which affects the state or prospects of industry or commerce either generally or in any of their branches <\s>
<s> the rate of interest therefore on good security which alone we have here to consider for interest in which considerations of risk bear a part may swell to any amount is seldom in the great centers of money transactions precisely the same for two days together as is shown by the never ceasing variations in the quoted prices of the funds and other negotiable securities <\s>
<s> nevertheless there must be as in other cases of value some rate which in the language of adam smith and ricardo may be called the natural rate some rate about which the market rate oscillates and to which it always tends to return <\s>
<s> this rate partly depends on the amount of accumulation going on in the hands of persons who can not themselves attend to the employment of their savings and partly on the comparative taste existing in the community for the active pursuits of industry or for the leisure ease and independence of an annuitant <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the permanent demand and supply of loans <\s>
<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>
<s> these are naturally borrowers and the amount which they desire to borrow and can give security for constitutes the demand for loans on account of productive employment <\s>
<s> to these must be added the loans required by government and by land owners or other unproductive consumers who have good security to give <\s>
<s> this constitutes the mass of loans for which there is an habitual demand <\s>
<s> now it is conceivable that there might exist in the hands of persons disinclined or disqualified for engaging personally in business 1 a mass of capital equal to and even exceeding this demand <\s>
<s> in that case there would be an habitual excess of competition on the part of lenders and the rate of interest would bear a low proportion to the rate of profit <\s>
<s> interest would be forced down to the point which would either tempt borrowers to take a greater amount of loans than they had a reasonable expectation of being able to employ in their business or would so discourage a portion of the lenders as to make them either forbear to accumulate or endeavor to increase their income by engaging in business on their own account and incurring the risks if not the labors of industrial employment <\s>
<s> the low rates of interest rather tempt people to take some additional risk and enter into investments which offer a higher rate of dividends so that a period of low interest is a time when speculative enterprises find victims and then by bad and worthless investments much of the loanable funds is actually lost thereby reducing the total quantity of loans more nearly to that demand which will give an ordinary rate of interest <\s>
<s> 2 on the other hand the capital owned by persons who prefer lending it at interest or whose avocations prevent them from personally superintending its employment may be short of the habitual demand for loans <\s>
<s> it may be in great part absorbed by the investments afforded by the public debt and by mortgages and the remainder may not be sufficient to supply the wants of commerce <\s>
<s> if so the rate of interest will be raised so high as in some way to re establish the equilibrium <\s>
<s> when there is only a small difference between interest and profit many borrowers may no longer be willing to increase their responsibilities and involve their credit for so small a remuneration or some who would otherwise have engaged in business may prefer leisure and become lenders instead of borrowers or others under the inducement of high interest and easy investment for their capital may retire from business earlier and with smaller fortunes than they otherwise would have done <\s>

<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>

<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>

<s> how much goes to the one and how much to the other is shown by the amount of the remuneration which when the two functions are separated the owner of capital can obtain from the employer for its use <\s>
<s> this is evidently a question of demand and supply <\s>

<s> the rate of interest will be such as to equalize the demand for loans with the supply of them <\s>

<s> nevertheless there must be as in other cases of value some rate which in the language of adam smith and ricardo may be called the natural rate some rate about which the market rate oscillates and to which it always tends to return <\s>

<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>

<s> to these must be added the loans required by government and by land owners or other unproductive consumers who have good security to give <\s>

<s> now it is conceivable that there might exist in the hands of persons disinclined or disqualified for engaging personally in business 1 a mass of capital equal to and even exceeding this demand <\s>

<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>
<s> suppose that some american production could be bought while the currency was still metallic for 25 and sold in england for 27.50 the difference covering the expense and risk and affording a profit to the merchant <\s>
<s> on account of the depreciation this commodity will now cost in the united states 30 and can not be sold in england for more than 27.50 and yet it will be exported as before <\s>
<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>

<s> but 25 or the quantity of gold contained in them having come to be worth in the united states 30 it follows that a bill on england for 25 will be worth 30 <\s>
<s> when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation <\s>
<s> if the currency is depreciated 10 15 or 20 per cent then in whatever way the real exchange arising from the variations of international debts and credits may vary the quoted exchange will always differ 10 15 or 20 per cent from it <\s>
<s> however high this nominal premium may be it has no tendency to send gold out of the country for the purpose of drawing a bill against it and profiting by the premium because the gold so sent must be procured not from the banks and at par as in the case of a convertible currency but in the market at an advance of price equal to the premium <\s>
<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>

<s> the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency <\s>
<s> whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit money prices rise just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money <\s>

<s> as a consequence of high prices exportation is checked and importation stimulated though in fact the increase of importation seldom waits for the rise of prices which is the consequence of speculation inasmuch as some of the great articles of import are usually among the things in which speculative overtrading first shows itself <\s>
<s> there is therefore in such periods usually a great excess of imports over exports and when the time comes at which these must be paid for the exchanges become unfavorable and gold flows out of the country <\s>

<s> we found that the gross profit of capital might be distinguished into three parts which are respectively the remuneration for risk for trouble and for the capital itself and may be termed insurance wages of superintendence and interest <\s>
<s> after making compensation for risk that is after covering the average losses to which capital is exposed either by the general circumstances of society or by the hazards of the particular employment there remains a surplus which partly goes to repay the owner of the capital for his abstinence and partly the employer of it for his time and trouble <\s>
<s> how much goes to the one and how much to the other is shown by the amount of the remuneration which when the two functions are separated the owner of capital can obtain from the employer for its use <\s>
<s> this is evidently a question of demand and supply <\s>
<s> nor have demand and supply any different meaning or effect in this case from what they have in all others <\s>
<s> the rate of interest will be such as to equalize the demand for loans with the supply of them <\s>
<s> it will be such that exactly as much as some people are desirous to borrow at that rate others shall be willing to lend <\s>
<s> if there is more offered than demanded interest will fall if more is demanded than offered it will rise and in both cases to the point at which the equation of supply and demand is re established <\s>

<s> the rate of interest therefore on good security which alone we have here to consider for interest in which considerations of risk bear a part may swell to any amount is seldom in the great centers of money transactions precisely the same for two days together as is shown by the never ceasing variations in the quoted prices of the funds and other negotiable securities <\s>
<s> nevertheless there must be as in other cases of value some rate which in the language of adam smith and ricardo may be called the natural rate some rate about which the market rate oscillates and to which it always tends to return <\s>
<s> this rate partly depends on the amount of accumulation going on in the hands of persons who can not themselves attend to the employment of their savings and partly on the comparative taste existing in the community for the active pursuits of industry or for the leisure ease and independence of an annuitant <\s>

<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>

<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>

<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>

<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>
<s> suppose that some american production could be bought while the currency was still metallic for 25 and sold in england for 27.50 the difference covering the expense and risk and affording a profit to the merchant <\s>
<s> on account of the depreciation this commodity will now cost in the united states 30 and can not be sold in england for more than 27.50 and yet it will be exported as before <\s>
<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>
<s> but though the trade is not affected the exchanges are <\s>
<s> when the imports and exports are in equilibrium the exchange in a metallic currency would be at par a bill on england for the equivalent of 25 would be worth 25 <\s>
<s> but 25 or the quantity of gold contained in them having come to be worth in the united states 30 it follows that a bill on england for 25 will be worth 30 <\s>
<s> when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation <\s>
<s> if the currency is depreciated 10 15 or 20 per cent then in whatever way the real exchange arising from the variations of international debts and credits may vary the quoted exchange will always differ 10 15 or 20 per cent from it <\s>
<s> however high this nominal premium may be it has no tendency to send gold out of the country for the purpose of drawing a bill against it and profiting by the premium because the gold so sent must be procured not from the banks and at par as in the case of a convertible currency but in the market at an advance of price equal to the premium <\s>
<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>
<s> since the amount of depreciation is exactly measured by the degree in which the market price of bullion exceeds the mint valuation we have a sure criterion to determine what portion of the quoted exchange being referable to depreciation may be struck off as nominal the result so corrected expressing the real exchange <\s>
<s> the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency <\s>
<s> whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit money prices rise just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money <\s>
<s> all the effects therefore must be similar <\s>
<s> as a consequence of high prices exportation is checked and importation stimulated though in fact the increase of importation seldom waits for the rise of prices which is the consequence of speculation inasmuch as some of the great articles of import are usually among the things in which speculative overtrading first shows itself <\s>
<s> there is therefore in such periods usually a great excess of imports over exports and when the time comes at which these must be paid for the exchanges become unfavorable and gold flows out of the country <\s>
<s> this efflux of gold takes effect on prices by withdrawing gold from the reserves of the banks and so by stopping loans and the use of credit or purchasing power ]: its effect is to make them recoil downward <\s>
<s> the recoil once begun generally becomes a total rout and the unusual extension of credit is rapidly exchanged for an unusual contraction of it <\s>

<s> real and nominal exchange <\s>
<s> when metallic money had been entirely superseded and expelled from circulation by the substitution of an equal amount of bank notes any attempt to keep a still further quantity of paper in circulation must if the notes are convertible into gold be a complete failure <\s>
<s> this brings up the whole question at issue between the    currency principle    and the    banking principle    the latter maintained by fullerton wilson price and tooke in his later writings held that if notes were convertible the value of notes could not differ from the value of the metal into which they were convertible while the former advocated by lord overstone g <\s>

<s> this last school brought about the bank act of 1844 284 a new issue would again set in motion the same train of consequences by which the gold coin had already been expelled <\s>
<s> the metals would as before be required for exportation and would be for that purpose demanded from the banks to the full extent of the superfluous notes which thus could not possibly be retained in circulation <\s>
<s> if indeed the notes were inconvertible there would be no such obstacle to the increase in their quantity <\s>
<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>
<s> suppose that some american production could be bought while the currency was still metallic for 25 and sold in england for 27.50 the difference covering the expense and risk and affording a profit to the merchant <\s>
<s> on account of the depreciation this commodity will now cost in the united states 30 and can not be sold in england for more than 27.50 and yet it will be exported as before <\s>
<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>
<s> but though the trade is not affected the exchanges are <\s>
<s> when the imports and exports are in equilibrium the exchange in a metallic currency would be at par a bill on england for the equivalent of 25 would be worth 25 <\s>
<s> but 25 or the quantity of gold contained in them having come to be worth in the united states 30 it follows that a bill on england for 25 will be worth 30 <\s>
<s> when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation <\s>
<s> if the currency is depreciated 10 15 or 20 per cent then in whatever way the real exchange arising from the variations of international debts and credits may vary the quoted exchange will always differ 10 15 or 20 per cent from it <\s>
<s> however high this nominal premium may be it has no tendency to send gold out of the country for the purpose of drawing a bill against it and profiting by the premium because the gold so sent must be procured not from the banks and at par as in the case of a convertible currency but in the market at an advance of price equal to the premium <\s>
<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>
<s> since the amount of depreciation is exactly measured by the degree in which the market price of bullion exceeds the mint valuation we have a sure criterion to determine what portion of the quoted exchange being referable to depreciation may be struck off as nominal the result so corrected expressing the real exchange <\s>
<s> the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency <\s>
<s> whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit money prices rise just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money <\s>
<s> all the effects therefore must be similar <\s>
<s> as a consequence of high prices exportation is checked and importation stimulated though in fact the increase of importation seldom waits for the rise of prices which is the consequence of speculation inasmuch as some of the great articles of import are usually among the things in which speculative overtrading first shows itself <\s>
<s> there is therefore in such periods usually a great excess of imports over exports and when the time comes at which these must be paid for the exchanges become unfavorable and gold flows out of the country <\s>
<s> this efflux of gold takes effect on prices by withdrawing gold from the reserves of the banks and so by stopping loans and the use of credit or purchasing power ]: its effect is to make them recoil downward <\s>
<s> the recoil once begun generally becomes a total rout and the unusual extension of credit is rapidly exchanged for an unusual contraction of it <\s>
<s> accordingly when credit has been imprudently stretched and the speculative spirit carried to excess the turn of the exchanges and consequent pressure on the banks to obtain gold for exportation are generally the proximate cause of the catastrophe <\s>

<s> when metallic money had been entirely superseded and expelled from circulation by the substitution of an equal amount of bank notes any attempt to keep a still further quantity of paper in circulation must if the notes are convertible into gold be a complete failure <\s>
<s> this brings up the whole question at issue between the    currency principle    and the    banking principle    the latter maintained by fullerton wilson price and tooke in his later writings held that if notes were convertible the value of notes could not differ from the value of the metal into which they were convertible while the former advocated by lord overstone g <\s>

<s> this last school brought about the bank act of 1844 284 a new issue would again set in motion the same train of consequences by which the gold coin had already been expelled <\s>
<s> the metals would as before be required for exportation and would be for that purpose demanded from the banks to the full extent of the superfluous notes which thus could not possibly be retained in circulation <\s>
<s> if indeed the notes were inconvertible there would be no such obstacle to the increase in their quantity <\s>
<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>
<s> suppose that some american production could be bought while the currency was still metallic for 25 and sold in england for 27.50 the difference covering the expense and risk and affording a profit to the merchant <\s>
<s> on account of the depreciation this commodity will now cost in the united states 30 and can not be sold in england for more than 27.50 and yet it will be exported as before <\s>
<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>
<s> but though the trade is not affected the exchanges are <\s>
<s> when the imports and exports are in equilibrium the exchange in a metallic currency would be at par a bill on england for the equivalent of 25 would be worth 25 <\s>
<s> but 25 or the quantity of gold contained in them having come to be worth in the united states 30 it follows that a bill on england for 25 will be worth 30 <\s>
<s> when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation <\s>
<s> if the currency is depreciated 10 15 or 20 per cent then in whatever way the real exchange arising from the variations of international debts and credits may vary the quoted exchange will always differ 10 15 or 20 per cent from it <\s>
<s> however high this nominal premium may be it has no tendency to send gold out of the country for the purpose of drawing a bill against it and profiting by the premium because the gold so sent must be procured not from the banks and at par as in the case of a convertible currency but in the market at an advance of price equal to the premium <\s>
<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>
<s> since the amount of depreciation is exactly measured by the degree in which the market price of bullion exceeds the mint valuation we have a sure criterion to determine what portion of the quoted exchange being referable to depreciation may be struck off as nominal the result so corrected expressing the real exchange <\s>
<s> the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency <\s>
<s> whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit money prices rise just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money <\s>

<s> when metallic money had been entirely superseded and expelled from circulation by the substitution of an equal amount of bank notes any attempt to keep a still further quantity of paper in circulation must if the notes are convertible into gold be a complete failure <\s>
<s> this brings up the whole question at issue between the    currency principle    and the    banking principle    the latter maintained by fullerton wilson price and tooke in his later writings held that if notes were convertible the value of notes could not differ from the value of the metal into which they were convertible while the former advocated by lord overstone g <\s>

<s> if indeed the notes were inconvertible there would be no such obstacle to the increase in their quantity <\s>
<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>
<s> suppose that some american production could be bought while the currency was still metallic for 25 and sold in england for 27.50 the difference covering the expense and risk and affording a profit to the merchant <\s>
<s> on account of the depreciation this commodity will now cost in the united states 30 and can not be sold in england for more than 27.50 and yet it will be exported as before <\s>
<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>
<s> but though the trade is not affected the exchanges are <\s>
<s> when the imports and exports are in equilibrium the exchange in a metallic currency would be at par a bill on england for the equivalent of 25 would be worth 25 <\s>
<s> but 25 or the quantity of gold contained in them having come to be worth in the united states 30 it follows that a bill on england for 25 will be worth 30 <\s>
<s> when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation <\s>
<s> if the currency is depreciated 10 15 or 20 per cent then in whatever way the real exchange arising from the variations of international debts and credits may vary the quoted exchange will always differ 10 15 or 20 per cent from it <\s>
<s> however high this nominal premium may be it has no tendency to send gold out of the country for the purpose of drawing a bill against it and profiting by the premium because the gold so sent must be procured not from the banks and at par as in the case of a convertible currency but in the market at an advance of price equal to the premium <\s>
<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>

<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>

<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>

<s> the low rates of interest rather tempt people to take some additional risk and enter into investments which offer a higher rate of dividends so that a period of low interest is a time when speculative enterprises find victims and then by bad and worthless investments much of the loanable funds is actually lost thereby reducing the total quantity of loans more nearly to that demand which will give an ordinary rate of interest <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>

<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>

<s> when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation <\s>
<s> if the currency is depreciated 10 15 or 20 per cent then in whatever way the real exchange arising from the variations of international debts and credits may vary the quoted exchange will always differ 10 15 or 20 per cent from it <\s>
<s> however high this nominal premium may be it has no tendency to send gold out of the country for the purpose of drawing a bill against it and profiting by the premium because the gold so sent must be procured not from the banks and at par as in the case of a convertible currency but in the market at an advance of price equal to the premium <\s>
<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>

<s> the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency <\s>
<s> whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit money prices rise just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money <\s>

<s> how much goes to the one and how much to the other is shown by the amount of the remuneration which when the two functions are separated the owner of capital can obtain from the employer for its use <\s>

<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>

<s> to these must be added the loans required by government and by land owners or other unproductive consumers who have good security to give <\s>
<s> this constitutes the mass of loans for which there is an habitual demand <\s>
<s> now it is conceivable that there might exist in the hands of persons disinclined or disqualified for engaging personally in business 1 a mass of capital equal to and even exceeding this demand <\s>
<s> in that case there would be an habitual excess of competition on the part of lenders and the rate of interest would bear a low proportion to the rate of profit <\s>

<s> the low rates of interest rather tempt people to take some additional risk and enter into investments which offer a higher rate of dividends so that a period of low interest is a time when speculative enterprises find victims and then by bad and worthless investments much of the loanable funds is actually lost thereby reducing the total quantity of loans more nearly to that demand which will give an ordinary rate of interest <\s>
<s> 2 on the other hand the capital owned by persons who prefer lending it at interest or whose avocations prevent them from personally superintending its employment may be short of the habitual demand for loans <\s>
<s> it may be in great part absorbed by the investments afforded by the public debt and by mortgages and the remainder may not be sufficient to supply the wants of commerce <\s>

<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>

<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>
<s> suppose that some american production could be bought while the currency was still metallic for 25 and sold in england for 27.50 the difference covering the expense and risk and affording a profit to the merchant <\s>

<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>

<s> when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>

<s> the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency <\s>
<s> whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit money prices rise just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money <\s>

<s> how much goes to the one and how much to the other is shown by the amount of the remuneration which when the two functions are separated the owner of capital can obtain from the employer for its use <\s>
<s> this is evidently a question of demand and supply <\s>

<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>

<s> to these must be added the loans required by government and by land owners or other unproductive consumers who have good security to give <\s>

<s> now it is conceivable that there might exist in the hands of persons disinclined or disqualified for engaging personally in business 1 a mass of capital equal to and even exceeding this demand <\s>
<s> in that case there would be an habitual excess of competition on the part of lenders and the rate of interest would bear a low proportion to the rate of profit <\s>

<s> the low rates of interest rather tempt people to take some additional risk and enter into investments which offer a higher rate of dividends so that a period of low interest is a time when speculative enterprises find victims and then by bad and worthless investments much of the loanable funds is actually lost thereby reducing the total quantity of loans more nearly to that demand which will give an ordinary rate of interest <\s>

<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>

<s> how much goes to the one and how much to the other is shown by the amount of the remuneration which when the two functions are separated the owner of capital can obtain from the employer for its use <\s>

<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>

<s> to these must be added the loans required by government and by land owners or other unproductive consumers who have good security to give <\s>

<s> now it is conceivable that there might exist in the hands of persons disinclined or disqualified for engaging personally in business 1 a mass of capital equal to and even exceeding this demand <\s>
<s> in that case there would be an habitual excess of competition on the part of lenders and the rate of interest would bear a low proportion to the rate of profit <\s>

<s> the low rates of interest rather tempt people to take some additional risk and enter into investments which offer a higher rate of dividends so that a period of low interest is a time when speculative enterprises find victims and then by bad and worthless investments much of the loanable funds is actually lost thereby reducing the total quantity of loans more nearly to that demand which will give an ordinary rate of interest <\s>
<s> 2 on the other hand the capital owned by persons who prefer lending it at interest or whose avocations prevent them from personally superintending its employment may be short of the habitual demand for loans <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>

<s> circumstances which determine the permanent demand and supply of loans <\s>
<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>
<s> these are naturally borrowers and the amount which they desire to borrow and can give security for constitutes the demand for loans on account of productive employment <\s>
<s> to these must be added the loans required by government and by land owners or other unproductive consumers who have good security to give <\s>
<s> this constitutes the mass of loans for which there is an habitual demand <\s>
<s> now it is conceivable that there might exist in the hands of persons disinclined or disqualified for engaging personally in business 1 a mass of capital equal to and even exceeding this demand <\s>
<s> in that case there would be an habitual excess of competition on the part of lenders and the rate of interest would bear a low proportion to the rate of profit <\s>

<s> the low rates of interest rather tempt people to take some additional risk and enter into investments which offer a higher rate of dividends so that a period of low interest is a time when speculative enterprises find victims and then by bad and worthless investments much of the loanable funds is actually lost thereby reducing the total quantity of loans more nearly to that demand which will give an ordinary rate of interest <\s>

<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>

<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>

<s> but 25 or the quantity of gold contained in them having come to be worth in the united states 30 it follows that a bill on england for 25 will be worth 30 <\s>
<s> when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation <\s>

<s> however high this nominal premium may be it has no tendency to send gold out of the country for the purpose of drawing a bill against it and profiting by the premium because the gold so sent must be procured not from the banks and at par as in the case of a convertible currency but in the market at an advance of price equal to the premium <\s>
<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>

<s> the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency <\s>
<s> whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit money prices rise just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money <\s>

<s> there is therefore in such periods usually a great excess of imports over exports and when the time comes at which these must be paid for the exchanges become unfavorable and gold flows out of the country <\s>

<s> the two topics of currency and loans though in themselves distinct are so intimately blended in the phenomena of what is called the money market that it is impossible to understand the one without the other and in many minds the two subjects are mixed up in the most inextricable confusion <\s>
<s> in the preceding book 285 we defined the relation in which interest stands to profit <\s>
<s> we found that the gross profit of capital might be distinguished into three parts which are respectively the remuneration for risk for trouble and for the capital itself and may be termed insurance wages of superintendence and interest <\s>
<s> after making compensation for risk that is after covering the average losses to which capital is exposed either by the general circumstances of society or by the hazards of the particular employment there remains a surplus which partly goes to repay the owner of the capital for his abstinence and partly the employer of it for his time and trouble <\s>
<s> how much goes to the one and how much to the other is shown by the amount of the remuneration which when the two functions are separated the owner of capital can obtain from the employer for its use <\s>
<s> this is evidently a question of demand and supply <\s>
<s> nor have demand and supply any different meaning or effect in this case from what they have in all others <\s>
<s> the rate of interest will be such as to equalize the demand for loans with the supply of them <\s>
<s> it will be such that exactly as much as some people are desirous to borrow at that rate others shall be willing to lend <\s>
<s> if there is more offered than demanded interest will fall if more is demanded than offered it will rise and in both cases to the point at which the equation of supply and demand is re established <\s>
<s> the desire to borrow and the willingness to lend are more or less influenced by every circumstance which affects the state or prospects of industry or commerce either generally or in any of their branches <\s>
<s> the rate of interest therefore on good security which alone we have here to consider for interest in which considerations of risk bear a part may swell to any amount is seldom in the great centers of money transactions precisely the same for two days together as is shown by the never ceasing variations in the quoted prices of the funds and other negotiable securities <\s>
<s> nevertheless there must be as in other cases of value some rate which in the language of adam smith and ricardo may be called the natural rate some rate about which the market rate oscillates and to which it always tends to return <\s>
<s> this rate partly depends on the amount of accumulation going on in the hands of persons who can not themselves attend to the employment of their savings and partly on the comparative taste existing in the community for the active pursuits of industry or for the leisure ease and independence of an annuitant <\s>
<s> circumstances which determine the permanent demand and supply of loans <\s>
<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>
<s> these are naturally borrowers and the amount which they desire to borrow and can give security for constitutes the demand for loans on account of productive employment <\s>
<s> to these must be added the loans required by government and by land owners or other unproductive consumers who have good security to give <\s>
<s> this constitutes the mass of loans for which there is an habitual demand <\s>
<s> now it is conceivable that there might exist in the hands of persons disinclined or disqualified for engaging personally in business 1 a mass of capital equal to and even exceeding this demand <\s>
<s> in that case there would be an habitual excess of competition on the part of lenders and the rate of interest would bear a low proportion to the rate of profit <\s>
<s> interest would be forced down to the point which would either tempt borrowers to take a greater amount of loans than they had a reasonable expectation of being able to employ in their business or would so discourage a portion of the lenders as to make them either forbear to accumulate or endeavor to increase their income by engaging in business on their own account and incurring the risks if not the labors of industrial employment <\s>
<s> the low rates of interest rather tempt people to take some additional risk and enter into investments which offer a higher rate of dividends so that a period of low interest is a time when speculative enterprises find victims and then by bad and worthless investments much of the loanable funds is actually lost thereby reducing the total quantity of loans more nearly to that demand which will give an ordinary rate of interest <\s>
<s> 2 on the other hand the capital owned by persons who prefer lending it at interest or whose avocations prevent them from personally superintending its employment may be short of the habitual demand for loans <\s>
<s> it may be in great part absorbed by the investments afforded by the public debt and by mortgages and the remainder may not be sufficient to supply the wants of commerce <\s>
<s> if so the rate of interest will be raised so high as in some way to re establish the equilibrium <\s>
<s> when there is only a small difference between interest and profit many borrowers may no longer be willing to increase their responsibilities and involve their credit for so small a remuneration or some who would otherwise have engaged in business may prefer leisure and become lenders instead of borrowers or others under the inducement of high interest and easy investment for their capital may retire from business earlier and with smaller fortunes than they otherwise would have done <\s>

<s> an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing <\s>
<s> when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be <\s>
<s> but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export <\s>
<s> the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond <\s>
<s> let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper <\s>

<s> because the 27.50 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other thingsif the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 27.50 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses <\s>
<s> it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value <\s>

<s> in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign <\s>
<s> the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par <\s>
<s> the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable <\s>

<s> how much goes to the one and how much to the other is shown by the amount of the remuneration which when the two functions are separated the owner of capital can obtain from the employer for its use <\s>
<s> this is evidently a question of demand and supply <\s>

<s> the rate of interest will be such as to equalize the demand for loans with the supply of them <\s>

<s> nevertheless there must be as in other cases of value some rate which in the language of adam smith and ricardo may be called the natural rate some rate about which the market rate oscillates and to which it always tends to return <\s>

<s> in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for <\s>

<s> to these must be added the loans required by government and by land owners or other unproductive consumers who have good security to give <\s>

<s> now it is conceivable that there might exist in the hands of persons disinclined or disqualified for engaging personally in business 1 a mass of capital equal to and even exceeding this demand <\s>

<s> now it is conceivable that there might exist in the hands of persons disinclined or disqualified for engaging personally in business 1 a mass of capital equal to and even exceeding this demand <\s>
<s> in that case there would be an habitual excess of competition on the part of lenders and the rate of interest would bear a low proportion to the rate of profit <\s>
<s> interest would be forced down to the point which would either tempt borrowers to take a greater amount of loans than they had a reasonable expectation of being able to employ in their business or would so discourage a portion of the lenders as to make them either forbear to accumulate or endeavor to increase their income by engaging in business on their own account and incurring the risks if not the labors of industrial employment <\s>
<s> the low rates of interest rather tempt people to take some additional risk and enter into investments which offer a higher rate of dividends so that a period of low interest is a time when speculative enterprises find victims and then by bad and worthless investments much of the loanable funds is actually lost thereby reducing the total quantity of loans more nearly to that demand which will give an ordinary rate of interest <\s>
<s> 2 on the other hand the capital owned by persons who prefer lending it at interest or whose avocations prevent them from personally superintending its employment may be short of the habitual demand for loans <\s>
<s> it may be in great part absorbed by the investments afforded by the public debt and by mortgages and the remainder may not be sufficient to supply the wants of commerce <\s>
<s> if so the rate of interest will be raised so high as in some way to re establish the equilibrium <\s>
<s> when there is only a small difference between interest and profit many borrowers may no longer be willing to increase their responsibilities and involve their credit for so small a remuneration or some who would otherwise have engaged in business may prefer leisure and become lenders instead of borrowers or others under the inducement of high interest and easy investment for their capital may retire from business earlier and with smaller fortunes than they otherwise would have done <\s>
<s> or lastly instead of capital being afforded by persons not in business the affording it may itself become a business <\s>
<s> a portion of the capital employed in trade may be supplied by a class of professional money lenders <\s>
<s> these money lenders however must have more than a mere interest they must have the ordinary rate of profit on their capital risk and all other circumstances being allowed for <\s>

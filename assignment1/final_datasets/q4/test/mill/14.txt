<s> and yet the very fact that the prices are less here implies that gold is of high value relatively to the given commodity while in london if money is to be sent back in payment and if prices are high there that implies that gold is there of less comparative value than commodities and consequently that gold is the cheapest article to send to the united states <\s>

<s> if two countries which traded together attempted as far as was physically possible to produce for themselves what they now import from one another the labor and capital of the two countries would not be so productive the two together would not obtain from their industry so great a quantity of commodities as when each employs itself in producing both for itself and for the other the things in which its labor is relatively most efficient <\s>
<s> the addition thus made to the produce of the two combined constitutes the advantage of the trade <\s>

<s> bowen 263 gives an instance of international trade where one country has the advantage in both of the commodities entering into the exchange    the inhabitants of barbadoes favored by their tropical climate and fertile soil can raise provisions cheaper than we can in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet barbadoes buys nearly all her provisions from this country <\s>
<s> why is this so <\s>
<s> because though barbadoes has the advantage over us in the ability to raise provisions cheaply she has a still greater advantage over us in her power to produce sugar and molasses <\s>
<s> if she has an advantage of one fourth in raising provisions she has an advantage of one half in regard to products exclusively tropical and it is better for her to employ all her labor and capital in that branch of production in which her advantage is greatest <\s>
<s> she can thus by trading with us obtain our breadstuffs and meat at a smaller expense of labor and capital than they cost ourselves <\s>
<s> if for instance a barrel of flour costs ten days    labor in the united states and only eight days    labor in barbadoes the people of barbadoes can still profitably buy the flour from this country if they can pay for it with sugar which cost them only six days    labor and the people of this country can profitably sell them the flour or buy from them the sugar provided the sugar if raised in the united states would cost eleven days    labor .... <\s>

<s> if barbadoes produced both commodities with greater facility but greater in precisely the same degree there would be no motive for interchange    it may be said however that in practice no business man considers the question of    comparative cost    in making shipments of goods abroad that all he thinks of is whether the price here for example is less than it is in london <\s>
<s> and yet the very fact that the prices are less here implies that gold is of high value relatively to the given commodity while in london if money is to be sent back in payment and if prices are high there that implies that gold is there of less comparative value than commodities and consequently that gold is the cheapest article to send to the united states <\s>

<s> if two countries which traded together attempted as far as was physically possible to produce for themselves what they now import from one another the labor and capital of the two countries would not be so productive the two together would not obtain from their industry so great a quantity of commodities as when each employs itself in producing both for itself and for the other the things in which its labor is relatively most efficient <\s>
<s> the addition thus made to the produce of the two combined constitutes the advantage of the trade <\s>
<s> it is possible that one of the two countries may be altogether inferior to the other in productive capacities and that its labor and capital could be employed to greatest advantage by being removed bodily to the other <\s>
<s> the labor and capital which have been sunk in rendering holland habitable would have produced a much greater return if transported to america or ireland <\s>
<s> the produce of the whole world would be greater or the labor less than it is if everything were produced where there is the greatest absolute facility for its production <\s>
<s> but nations do not at least in modern times emigrate en masse and while the labor and capital of a country remain in the country they are most beneficially employed in producing for foreign markets as well as for its own the things in which it lies under the least disadvantage if there be none in which it possesses an advantage <\s>
<s> the fundamental ground on which all trade or all exchange of commodities rests is division of labor or separation of employments <\s>

<s> an extended market for its producean abundant consumption for its goodsa vent for its surplusare the phrases by which it has been customary to designate the uses and recommendations of commerce with foreign countries <\s>

<s> the notion that money alone is wealth has been long defunct but it has left many of its progeny behind it <\s>

<s> the expression surplus produce seems to imply that a country is under some kind of necessity of producing the corn or cloth which it exports so that the portion which it does not itself consume if not wanted and consumed elsewhere would either be produced in sheer waste or if it were not produced the corresponding portion of capital would remain idle and the mass of productions in the country would be diminished by so much <\s>
<s> either of these suppositions would be entirely erroneous <\s>
<s> the country produces an exportable article in excess of its own wants from no inherent necessity but as the cheapest mode of supplying itself with other things <\s>
<s> if prevented from exporting this surplus it would cease to produce it and would no longer import anything being unable to give an equivalent but the labor and capital which had been employed in producing with a view to exportation would find employment in producing those desirable objects which were previously brought from abroad or if some of them could not be produced in producing substitutes for them <\s>
<s> these articles would of course be produced at a greater cost than that of the things with which they had previously been purchased from foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the value and price of the articles would rise in proportion and the capital would just as much be replaced with the ordinary profit from the returns as it was when employed in producing for the foreign market <\s>

<s> and yet the very fact that the prices are less here implies that gold is of high value relatively to the given commodity while in london if money is to be sent back in payment and if prices are high there that implies that gold is there of less comparative value than commodities and consequently that gold is the cheapest article to send to the united states <\s>

<s> from this exposition we perceive in what consists the benefit of international exchange or in other words foreign commerce <\s>
<s> setting aside its enabling countries to obtain commodities which they could not themselves produce at all its advantage consists in a more efficient employment of the productive forces of the world <\s>
<s> if two countries which traded together attempted as far as was physically possible to produce for themselves what they now import from one another the labor and capital of the two countries would not be so productive the two together would not obtain from their industry so great a quantity of commodities as when each employs itself in producing both for itself and for the other the things in which its labor is relatively most efficient <\s>
<s> the addition thus made to the produce of the two combined constitutes the advantage of the trade <\s>
<s> it is possible that one of the two countries may be altogether inferior to the other in productive capacities and that its labor and capital could be employed to greatest advantage by being removed bodily to the other <\s>
<s> the labor and capital which have been sunk in rendering holland habitable would have produced a much greater return if transported to america or ireland <\s>
<s> the produce of the whole world would be greater or the labor less than it is if everything were produced where there is the greatest absolute facility for its production <\s>
<s> but nations do not at least in modern times emigrate en masse and while the labor and capital of a country remain in the country they are most beneficially employed in producing for foreign markets as well as for its own the things in which it lies under the least disadvantage if there be none in which it possesses an advantage <\s>
<s> the fundamental ground on which all trade or all exchange of commodities rests is division of labor or separation of employments <\s>
<s> beyond the ordinary gain from division of labor arising from increased dexterity there exist gains arising from the development of    the special capacities or resources possessed by particular individuals or localities    international exchanges call out chiefly the special advantages offered by particular localities for the prosecution of particular industries <\s>
<s>    the only case indeed in which personal aptitudes go for much in the commerce of nations is where the nations concerned occupy different grades in the scale of civilization .... <\s>
<s> the most striking example which the world has ever seen of a foreign trade determined by the peculiar personal qualities of those engaged in ministering to it is that which was furnished by the southern states of the american union previous to the abolition of slavery <\s>
<s> the effect of that institution was to give a very distinct industrial character to the laboring population of those states which unfitted them for all but a very limited number of occupations but gave them a certain special fitness for these <\s>
<s> almost the entire industry of the country was consequently turned to the production of two or three crude commodities in raising which the industry of slaves was found to be effective and these were used through an exchange with foreign countries as the means of supplying the inhabitants with all other requisites .... <\s>
<s> in the main however it would seem that this cause personal aptitudes does not go for very much in international commerce    266 in brief then international trade is but an extension of the principle of division of labor and the gains to increased productiveness arising from the latter are exactly the same as those from the former <\s>

<s> the expression surplus produce seems to imply that a country is under some kind of necessity of producing the corn or cloth which it exports so that the portion which it does not itself consume if not wanted and consumed elsewhere would either be produced in sheer waste or if it were not produced the corresponding portion of capital would remain idle and the mass of productions in the country would be diminished by so much <\s>

<s> these articles would of course be produced at a greater cost than that of the things with which they had previously been purchased from foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the value and price of the articles would rise in proportion and the capital would just as much be replaced with the ordinary profit from the returns as it was when employed in producing for the foreign market <\s>
<s> the only losers after the temporary inconvenience of the change would be the consumers of the heretofore imported articles who would be obliged either to do without them consuming in lieu of them something which they did not like as well or to pay a higher price for them than before <\s>

<s> the fundamental ground on which all trade or all exchange of commodities rests is division of labor or separation of employments <\s>
<s> beyond the ordinary gain from division of labor arising from increased dexterity there exist gains arising from the development of    the special capacities or resources possessed by particular individuals or localities    international exchanges call out chiefly the special advantages offered by particular localities for the prosecution of particular industries <\s>
<s>    the only case indeed in which personal aptitudes go for much in the commerce of nations is where the nations concerned occupy different grades in the scale of civilization .... <\s>
<s> the most striking example which the world has ever seen of a foreign trade determined by the peculiar personal qualities of those engaged in ministering to it is that which was furnished by the southern states of the american union previous to the abolition of slavery <\s>

<s> and yet the very fact that the prices are less here implies that gold is of high value relatively to the given commodity while in london if money is to be sent back in payment and if prices are high there that implies that gold is there of less comparative value than commodities and consequently that gold is the cheapest article to send to the united states <\s>

<s> if two countries which traded together attempted as far as was physically possible to produce for themselves what they now import from one another the labor and capital of the two countries would not be so productive the two together would not obtain from their industry so great a quantity of commodities as when each employs itself in producing both for itself and for the other the things in which its labor is relatively most efficient <\s>
<s> the addition thus made to the produce of the two combined constitutes the advantage of the trade <\s>

<s> bowen 263 gives an instance of international trade where one country has the advantage in both of the commodities entering into the exchange    the inhabitants of barbadoes favored by their tropical climate and fertile soil can raise provisions cheaper than we can in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet barbadoes buys nearly all her provisions from this country <\s>
<s> why is this so <\s>
<s> because though barbadoes has the advantage over us in the ability to raise provisions cheaply she has a still greater advantage over us in her power to produce sugar and molasses <\s>
<s> if she has an advantage of one fourth in raising provisions she has an advantage of one half in regard to products exclusively tropical and it is better for her to employ all her labor and capital in that branch of production in which her advantage is greatest <\s>
<s> she can thus by trading with us obtain our breadstuffs and meat at a smaller expense of labor and capital than they cost ourselves <\s>
<s> if for instance a barrel of flour costs ten days    labor in the united states and only eight days    labor in barbadoes the people of barbadoes can still profitably buy the flour from this country if they can pay for it with sugar which cost them only six days    labor and the people of this country can profitably sell them the flour or buy from them the sugar provided the sugar if raised in the united states would cost eleven days    labor .... <\s>

<s> if barbadoes produced both commodities with greater facility but greater in precisely the same degree there would be no motive for interchange    it may be said however that in practice no business man considers the question of    comparative cost    in making shipments of goods abroad that all he thinks of is whether the price here for example is less than it is in london <\s>
<s> and yet the very fact that the prices are less here implies that gold is of high value relatively to the given commodity while in london if money is to be sent back in payment and if prices are high there that implies that gold is there of less comparative value than commodities and consequently that gold is the cheapest article to send to the united states <\s>

<s> if two countries which traded together attempted as far as was physically possible to produce for themselves what they now import from one another the labor and capital of the two countries would not be so productive the two together would not obtain from their industry so great a quantity of commodities as when each employs itself in producing both for itself and for the other the things in which its labor is relatively most efficient <\s>
<s> the addition thus made to the produce of the two combined constitutes the advantage of the trade <\s>
<s> it is possible that one of the two countries may be altogether inferior to the other in productive capacities and that its labor and capital could be employed to greatest advantage by being removed bodily to the other <\s>
<s> the labor and capital which have been sunk in rendering holland habitable would have produced a much greater return if transported to america or ireland <\s>
<s> the produce of the whole world would be greater or the labor less than it is if everything were produced where there is the greatest absolute facility for its production <\s>
<s> but nations do not at least in modern times emigrate en masse and while the labor and capital of a country remain in the country they are most beneficially employed in producing for foreign markets as well as for its own the things in which it lies under the least disadvantage if there be none in which it possesses an advantage <\s>
<s> the fundamental ground on which all trade or all exchange of commodities rests is division of labor or separation of employments <\s>

<s> an extended market for its producean abundant consumption for its goodsa vent for its surplusare the phrases by which it has been customary to designate the uses and recommendations of commerce with foreign countries <\s>

<s> the notion that money alone is wealth has been long defunct but it has left many of its progeny behind it <\s>

<s> the expression surplus produce seems to imply that a country is under some kind of necessity of producing the corn or cloth which it exports so that the portion which it does not itself consume if not wanted and consumed elsewhere would either be produced in sheer waste or if it were not produced the corresponding portion of capital would remain idle and the mass of productions in the country would be diminished by so much <\s>
<s> either of these suppositions would be entirely erroneous <\s>
<s> the country produces an exportable article in excess of its own wants from no inherent necessity but as the cheapest mode of supplying itself with other things <\s>
<s> if prevented from exporting this surplus it would cease to produce it and would no longer import anything being unable to give an equivalent but the labor and capital which had been employed in producing with a view to exportation would find employment in producing those desirable objects which were previously brought from abroad or if some of them could not be produced in producing substitutes for them <\s>
<s> these articles would of course be produced at a greater cost than that of the things with which they had previously been purchased from foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the value and price of the articles would rise in proportion and the capital would just as much be replaced with the ordinary profit from the returns as it was when employed in producing for the foreign market <\s>

<s> and yet the very fact that the prices are less here implies that gold is of high value relatively to the given commodity while in london if money is to be sent back in payment and if prices are high there that implies that gold is there of less comparative value than commodities and consequently that gold is the cheapest article to send to the united states <\s>

<s> from this exposition we perceive in what consists the benefit of international exchange or in other words foreign commerce <\s>
<s> setting aside its enabling countries to obtain commodities which they could not themselves produce at all its advantage consists in a more efficient employment of the productive forces of the world <\s>
<s> if two countries which traded together attempted as far as was physically possible to produce for themselves what they now import from one another the labor and capital of the two countries would not be so productive the two together would not obtain from their industry so great a quantity of commodities as when each employs itself in producing both for itself and for the other the things in which its labor is relatively most efficient <\s>
<s> the addition thus made to the produce of the two combined constitutes the advantage of the trade <\s>
<s> it is possible that one of the two countries may be altogether inferior to the other in productive capacities and that its labor and capital could be employed to greatest advantage by being removed bodily to the other <\s>
<s> the labor and capital which have been sunk in rendering holland habitable would have produced a much greater return if transported to america or ireland <\s>
<s> the produce of the whole world would be greater or the labor less than it is if everything were produced where there is the greatest absolute facility for its production <\s>
<s> but nations do not at least in modern times emigrate en masse and while the labor and capital of a country remain in the country they are most beneficially employed in producing for foreign markets as well as for its own the things in which it lies under the least disadvantage if there be none in which it possesses an advantage <\s>
<s> the fundamental ground on which all trade or all exchange of commodities rests is division of labor or separation of employments <\s>
<s> beyond the ordinary gain from division of labor arising from increased dexterity there exist gains arising from the development of    the special capacities or resources possessed by particular individuals or localities    international exchanges call out chiefly the special advantages offered by particular localities for the prosecution of particular industries <\s>
<s>    the only case indeed in which personal aptitudes go for much in the commerce of nations is where the nations concerned occupy different grades in the scale of civilization .... <\s>
<s> the most striking example which the world has ever seen of a foreign trade determined by the peculiar personal qualities of those engaged in ministering to it is that which was furnished by the southern states of the american union previous to the abolition of slavery <\s>
<s> the effect of that institution was to give a very distinct industrial character to the laboring population of those states which unfitted them for all but a very limited number of occupations but gave them a certain special fitness for these <\s>
<s> almost the entire industry of the country was consequently turned to the production of two or three crude commodities in raising which the industry of slaves was found to be effective and these were used through an exchange with foreign countries as the means of supplying the inhabitants with all other requisites .... <\s>
<s> in the main however it would seem that this cause personal aptitudes does not go for very much in international commerce    266 in brief then international trade is but an extension of the principle of division of labor and the gains to increased productiveness arising from the latter are exactly the same as those from the former <\s>

<s> the expression surplus produce seems to imply that a country is under some kind of necessity of producing the corn or cloth which it exports so that the portion which it does not itself consume if not wanted and consumed elsewhere would either be produced in sheer waste or if it were not produced the corresponding portion of capital would remain idle and the mass of productions in the country would be diminished by so much <\s>

<s> these articles would of course be produced at a greater cost than that of the things with which they had previously been purchased from foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the value and price of the articles would rise in proportion and the capital would just as much be replaced with the ordinary profit from the returns as it was when employed in producing for the foreign market <\s>
<s> the only losers after the temporary inconvenience of the change would be the consumers of the heretofore imported articles who would be obliged either to do without them consuming in lieu of them something which they did not like as well or to pay a higher price for them than before <\s>

<s> the fundamental ground on which all trade or all exchange of commodities rests is division of labor or separation of employments <\s>
<s> beyond the ordinary gain from division of labor arising from increased dexterity there exist gains arising from the development of    the special capacities or resources possessed by particular individuals or localities    international exchanges call out chiefly the special advantages offered by particular localities for the prosecution of particular industries <\s>
<s>    the only case indeed in which personal aptitudes go for much in the commerce of nations is where the nations concerned occupy different grades in the scale of civilization .... <\s>
<s> the most striking example which the world has ever seen of a foreign trade determined by the peculiar personal qualities of those engaged in ministering to it is that which was furnished by the southern states of the american union previous to the abolition of slavery <\s>

<s> what then do these depend upon <\s>
<s> what is it which in the case supposed causes a pipe of wine from spain to be exchanged with the united states for exactly that quantity of cloth <\s>
<s> we have seen that it is not their cost of production <\s>
<s> in these circumstances no exchange would take place <\s>
<s> in this case the comparative costs of the two articles in england and in the united states were supposed to be the same though the absolute costs were different on which supposition we see that there would be no labor saved to either country by confining its industry to one of the two productions and importing the other <\s>
<s> it is otherwise when the comparative and not merely the absolute costs of the two articles are different in the two countries <\s>
<s> if while the iron produced with 100 days    labor in the united states was produced with 150 days    labor in england the corn which was produced in the united states with 100 days    labor could not be produced in england with less than 200 days    labor an adequate motive to exchange would immediately arise <\s>
<s> with a quantity of iron which england produced with 150 days    labor she would be able to purchase as much corn in the united states as was there produced with 100 days    labor but the quantity which was there produced with 100 days    labor would be as great as the quantity produced in england with 200 days    labor <\s>
<s> by importing corn therefore from the united states and paying for it with iron england would obtain for 150 days    labor what would otherwise cost her 200 being a saving of 50 days    labor on each repetition of the transaction and not merely a saving to england but a saving absolutely for it is not obtained at the expense of the united states who with corn that cost her 100 days    labor has purchased iron which if produced at home would have cost her the same <\s>
<s> the united states therefore on this supposition loses nothing but also she derives no advantage from the trade the imported iron costing her as much as if it were made at home <\s>
<s> to enable the united states to gain anything by the interchange something must be abated from the gain of england the corn produced in the united states by 100 days    labor must be able to purchase from england more iron than the united states could produce by that amount of labor more therefore than england could produce by 150 days    labor england thus obtaining the corn which would have cost her 200 days at a cost exceeding 150 though short of 200 <\s>
<s> england therefore no longer gains the whole of the labor which is saved to the two jointly by trading with one another 262 the case in which both england and the united states would gain from the trade may be thus briefly shown articles united states <\s>
<s> 100 days    labor 200 days    labor produces x bus <\s>
<s> 125 days    labor 150 days    labor produces y tons <\s>
<s> the ship which carries x bushels of corn from the united states to england can there exchange it for at least y tons of iron costing england 150 days    labor since x bushels in england would cost 200 days    labor and bring it home gaining for the united states the difference between the 100 days    labor in corn paid for the y tons of iron and the 125 days which the iron would have cost here if produced at home <\s>
<s> in this case the united states has an advantage over england in both corn and iron but still an international trade will spring up because the united states will derive a gain owing to the less cost of corn as compared with the cost of iron <\s>
<s> our comparative advantage is in corn <\s>
<s> england also by sending to the united states y tons of iron gets in return for it x bushels of corn <\s>
<s> to produce the corn herself would have cost her 200 days    labor but she bought that corn by only 150 days    labor spent on iron <\s>
<s> englands comparative advantage is in iron <\s>
<s> then both countries will gain <\s>
<s> bowen 263 gives an instance of international trade where one country has the advantage in both of the commodities entering into the exchange    the inhabitants of barbadoes favored by their tropical climate and fertile soil can raise provisions cheaper than we can in the united states <\s>
<s> and yet barbadoes buys nearly all her provisions from this country <\s>
<s> why is this so <\s>
<s> because though barbadoes has the advantage over us in the ability to raise provisions cheaply she has a still greater advantage over us in her power to produce sugar and molasses <\s>
<s> if she has an advantage of one fourth in raising provisions she has an advantage of one half in regard to products exclusively tropical and it is better for her to employ all her labor and capital in that branch of production in which her advantage is greatest <\s>
<s> she can thus by trading with us obtain our breadstuffs and meat at a smaller expense of labor and capital than they cost ourselves <\s>
<s> if for instance a barrel of flour costs ten days    labor in the united states and only eight days    labor in barbadoes the people of barbadoes can still profitably buy the flour from this country if they can pay for it with sugar which cost them only six days    labor and the people of this country can profitably sell them the flour or buy from them the sugar provided the sugar if raised in the united states would cost eleven days    labor .... <\s>
<s> the united states receive sugar which would have cost them eleven days    labor by paying for it with flour which costs them but ten days <\s>
<s> barbadoes receives flour which would have cost her eight days    labor by paying for it with sugar which costs her but six days <\s>
<s> if barbadoes produced both commodities with greater facility but greater in precisely the same degree there would be no motive for interchange    it may be said however that in practice no business man considers the question of    comparative cost    in making shipments of goods abroad that all he thinks of is whether the price here for example is less than it is in london <\s>
<s> and yet the very fact that the prices are less here implies that gold is of high value relatively to the given commodity while in london if money is to be sent back in payment and if prices are high there that implies that gold is there of less comparative value than commodities and consequently that gold is the cheapest article to send to the united states <\s>
<s> the doctrine then is as true of gold or the precious metals as it is of other commodities 264 it may be stated in the following language of mr <\s>
<s> cairnes    the proximate condition determining international exchange is the state of comparative prices in the exchanging countries as regards the commodities which form the subject of the trade <\s>
<s> but comparative prices within the limits of each country are determined by two distinct principleswithin the range of effective industrial competition by cost of production outside that range by reciprocal demand    265   3 <\s>
<s> the direct benefits of commerce consist in increased efficiency of the productive powers of the world <\s>
<s> from this exposition we perceive in what consists the benefit of international exchange or in other words foreign commerce <\s>
<s> setting aside its enabling countries to obtain commodities which they could not themselves produce at all its advantage consists in a more efficient employment of the productive forces of the world <\s>
<s> if two countries which traded together attempted as far as was physically possible to produce for themselves what they now import from one another the labor and capital of the two countries would not be so productive the two together would not obtain from their industry so great a quantity of commodities as when each employs itself in producing both for itself and for the other the things in which its labor is relatively most efficient <\s>
<s> the addition thus made to the produce of the two combined constitutes the advantage of the trade <\s>
<s> it is possible that one of the two countries may be altogether inferior to the other in productive capacities and that its labor and capital could be employed to greatest advantage by being removed bodily to the other <\s>
<s> the labor and capital which have been sunk in rendering holland habitable would have produced a much greater return if transported to america or ireland <\s>
<s> the produce of the whole world would be greater or the labor less than it is if everything were produced where there is the greatest absolute facility for its production <\s>
<s> but nations do not at least in modern times emigrate en masse and while the labor and capital of a country remain in the country they are most beneficially employed in producing for foreign markets as well as for its own the things in which it lies under the least disadvantage if there be none in which it possesses an advantage <\s>
<s> the fundamental ground on which all trade or all exchange of commodities rests is division of labor or separation of employments <\s>
<s> beyond the ordinary gain from division of labor arising from increased dexterity there exist gains arising from the development of    the special capacities or resources possessed by particular individuals or localities    international exchanges call out chiefly the special advantages offered by particular localities for the prosecution of particular industries <\s>
<s>    the only case indeed in which personal aptitudes go for much in the commerce of nations is where the nations concerned occupy different grades in the scale of civilization .... <\s>
<s> the most striking example which the world has ever seen of a foreign trade determined by the peculiar personal qualities of those engaged in ministering to it is that which was furnished by the southern states of the american union previous to the abolition of slavery <\s>
<s> the effect of that institution was to give a very distinct industrial character to the laboring population of those states which unfitted them for all but a very limited number of occupations but gave them a certain special fitness for these <\s>
<s> almost the entire industry of the country was consequently turned to the production of two or three crude commodities in raising which the industry of slaves was found to be effective and these were used through an exchange with foreign countries as the means of supplying the inhabitants with all other requisites .... <\s>
<s> in the main however it would seem that this cause personal aptitudes does not go for very much in international commerce    266 in brief then international trade is but an extension of the principle of division of labor and the gains to increased productiveness arising from the latter are exactly the same as those from the former <\s>
<s>    not in a vent for exports nor in the gains of merchants <\s>
<s> according to the doctrine now stated the only direct advantage of foreign commerce consists in the imports <\s>
<s> a country obtains things which it either could not have produced at all or which it must have produced at a greater expense of capital and labor than the cost of the things which it exports to pay for them <\s>
<s> it thus obtains a more ample supply of the commodities it wants for the same labor and capital or the same supply for less labor and capital leaving the surplus disposable to produce other things <\s>
<s> the vulgar theory disregards this benefit and deems the advantage of commerce to reside in the exports as if not what a country obtains but what it parts with by its foreign trade was supposed to constitute the gain to it <\s>
<s> an extended market for its producean abundant consumption for its goodsa vent for its surplusare the phrases by which it has been customary to designate the uses and recommendations of commerce with foreign countries <\s>
<s> this notion is intelligible when we consider that the authors and leaders of opinion on mercantile questions have always hitherto been the selling class <\s>
<s> it is in truth a surviving relic of the mercantile theory according to which money being the only wealth selling or in other words exchanging goods for money was to countries without mines of their own the only way of growing richand importation of goods that is to say parting with money was so much subtracted from the benefit <\s>
<s> the notion that money alone is wealth has been long defunct but it has left many of its progeny behind it <\s>
<s> adam smiths theory of the benefit of foreign trade was that it afforded an outlet for the surplus produce of a country and enabled a portion of the capital of the country to replace itself with a profit <\s>
<s> the expression surplus produce seems to imply that a country is under some kind of necessity of producing the corn or cloth which it exports so that the portion which it does not itself consume if not wanted and consumed elsewhere would either be produced in sheer waste or if it were not produced the corresponding portion of capital would remain idle and the mass of productions in the country would be diminished by so much <\s>
<s> either of these suppositions would be entirely erroneous <\s>
<s> the country produces an exportable article in excess of its own wants from no inherent necessity but as the cheapest mode of supplying itself with other things <\s>
<s> if prevented from exporting this surplus it would cease to produce it and would no longer import anything being unable to give an equivalent but the labor and capital which had been employed in producing with a view to exportation would find employment in producing those desirable objects which were previously brought from abroad or if some of them could not be produced in producing substitutes for them <\s>
<s> these articles would of course be produced at a greater cost than that of the things with which they had previously been purchased from foreign countries <\s>
<s> but the value and price of the articles would rise in proportion and the capital would just as much be replaced with the ordinary profit from the returns as it was when employed in producing for the foreign market <\s>
<s> the only losers after the temporary inconvenience of the change would be the consumers of the heretofore imported articles who would be obliged either to do without them consuming in lieu of them something which they did not like as well or to pay a higher price for them than before <\s>
<s> if it be said that the capital now employed in foreign trade could not find employment in supplying the home market i might reply that this is the fallacy of general over production discussed in a former chapter but the thing is in this particular case too evident to require an appeal to any general theory <\s>
<s> we not only see that the capital of the merchant would find employment but we see what employment <\s>
<s> there would be employment created equal to that which would be taken away <\s>
<s> exportation ceasing importation to an equal value would cease also and all that part of the income of the country which had been expended in imported commodities would be ready to expend itself on the same things produced at home or on others instead of them <\s>
<s> commerce is virtually a mode of cheapening production and in all such cases the consumer is the person ultimately benefited the dealer in the end is sure to get his profit whether the buyer obtains much or little for his money <\s>
<s> e converso if for any reason such as a removal of duties capital should be withdrawn from the production of articles consumed at home and imported commodities should entirely take their place the very importation of the foreign commodities would imply that an increased corresponding production was going on in this country with which to pay for the imported goods <\s>
<s> the capital thus thrown out of employment in an industry in which we had no comparative advantage when competition became free would necessarily be employed in the industries in which we had an advantage and would supplyand the transferred capital would be the only means of supplyingthe commodities which would be sent abroad to pay for those which by the supposition are now imported but were formerly produced at home <\s>
<s> the result is a greater productiveness of industry and so a greater sum from which both labor and capital may be rewarded <\s>
<s> whenever capital unrestrained by artificial support leaves one employment as unprofitable it means that that employment is naturally and in itself less productive than the usual run of other industries in the country and so less profitable to both labor and capital than the majority of other occupations <\s>
<s> indirect benefits of commerce economical and moral still greater than the direct <\s>
<s> such then is the direct economical advantage of foreign trade <\s>
<s> but there are besides indirect effects which must be counted as benefits of a high order <\s>
<s> 1 one is the tendency of every extension of the market to improve the processes of production <\s>
<s> a country which produces for a larger market than its own can introduce a more extended division of labor can make greater use of machinery and is more likely to make inventions and improvements in the processes of production <\s>

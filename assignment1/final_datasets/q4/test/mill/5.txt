<s> whenever capital is withdrawn from production or from the fund destined for production to be lent to the state and expended unproductively that whole sum is withheld from the laboring classes the loan therefore is in truth paid off the same year the whole of the sacrifice necessary for paying it off is actually made only it is paid to the wrong persons and therefore does not extinguish the claim and paid by the very worst of taxes a tax exclusively on the laboring class <\s>
<s> and after having in this most painful and unjust of ways gone through the whole effort necessary for extinguishing the debt the country remains charged with it and with the payment of its interest in perpetuity <\s>
<s> the united states for example borrows capital from a with which it buys stores from b <\s>
<s> if the loan all comes from within the country as capital is borrowed when the united states should have taken that amount outright by taxation <\s>
<s> when the money is borrowed of a the laborers undergo the sacrifice the title to the whole sum remains in as hands and the claim against the government by a still exists while if the amount were taken by taxation the title to the sum raised is in the state and it is paid to the right person <\s>
<s> the experience of the united states during the civil war is an illustration of this principle <\s>
<s> it is asserted that as a matter of fact the total expenses of the war were defrayed by the northern states during the four years of its continuance out of surplus earnings and yet at the close of the conflict a debt of 2,800 000,000 was saddled on the country <\s>
<s> the united states borrowed 2,400 000,000 revenue during that time 1,700 000,000 total cost of the war 4,100 000,000 in reality we borrowed only about 1,500 000,000 instead of 2,400 000,000 since 1 the government issued paper which depreciated and yet received it at par in subscriptions for loans <\s>
<s> moreover the total cost would have been much reduced had we issued no paper and 2 thereby not increased the prices of goods to the state and 3 if no interest account had been created by borrowing <\s>
<s> but could the country have raised the whole sum each year by taxation <\s>
<s> in the first fiscal year after the war the united states paid in war taxes 650,000 000 <\s>
<s> at the beginning of the struggle to june 30 1862 the expenditure was 515,000 000 and by june 30 1863 it had amounted to 1,098 000,000 so that 600,000 000 of taxes a year would have paid the war expenses and left us free of debt at the close <\s>
<s> a confirmatory experience is that of england during the continental wars 1793 1817 total war expenditures   1,060 000,000 interest charge on the existing debt 235,000 000 total amount required   1,295 000,000 revenue for that period 1,145 000,000 deficit   150,000 000 to provide for this deficit the government actually increased its debt by   600,000 000 <\s>
<s> a slight additional exertion would have provided   150,000 000 more of revenue and saved   450,000 000 to the taxpayers 109 the practical state of the case however seldom exactly corresponds with this supposition <\s>
<s> the loans of the less wealthy countries are made chiefly with foreign capital which would not perhaps have been brought in to be invested on any less security than that of the government while those of rich and prosperous countries are generally made not with funds withdrawn from productive employment but with the new accumulations constantly making from income and often with a part of them which if not so taken would have migrated to colonies or sought other investments abroad <\s>
<s> demand for commodities is not demand for labor <\s>
<s> mills statement of the theorem respecting capital discussed in the argument that    demand for commodities is not demand for labor    needs some simplification <\s>
<s> for this purpose represent by the letters of the alphabet a b c ... <\s>
<s> x y z the different kinds of commodities produced in the world which are exchanged against each other in the process of reaching the consumers <\s>
<s> this exchange of commodities for each other it need hardly be said does not increase the number or quantity of commodities already in existence since their production as we have seen requires labor and capital in connection with natural agents <\s>
<s> mere exchange does not alter the quantity of commodities produced <\s>
<s> to produce a plow for example the maker must have capital in the form of subsistence tools and materials of which some one has foregone the use by a process of saving in order that something else in this case a plow may be produced <\s>
<s> this saving must be accomplished first to an amount sufficient to keep production going on from day to day <\s>
<s> this capital is all consumed but in a longer or shorter term depending on the particular industrial operation it is reproduced in new forms adapted to the existing wants of man <\s>
<s> moreover without any new exertion of abstinence this amount of capital may be again consumed and reproduced and so go on forever after once being saved if never destroyed in the mean while thereby passing out of the category not only of capital but also of wealth <\s>
<s> the total capital of the country then is not the sum of one years capital added to that of another but that of last year reproduced in a new form this year plus a fractional increase arising from new savings <\s>
<s> but once saved capital can go on constantly aiding in production forever <\s>
<s> this plow when made is exchanged if a plow is wanted and the production is properly adjusted to meet desires for such other products food means for repairing tools etc as give back to the plow maker all the commodities consumed in its manufacture with an increase called profit <\s>
<s> returning to our illustration of the alphabet it is evident that a certain amount of capital united with labor constituting what may be called a productive engine lies behind the production of a such as the plow for example and to which its existence is due <\s>
<s> the same is true of z <\s>
<s> suppose that 5,000 of z is produced of which 4,000 is enough to reimburse the capital used up by labor in the operation and that the owner of commodity z spends the remaining 1,000 z in exchange for 1,000 of commodity a <\s>
<s> it is evident no money being used as yet that this exchange of goods is regulated entirely by the desires of the two parties to the transaction <\s>
<s> no more goods are created simply by the exchange the simple process of exchange does not keep the laborers engaged on a occupied <\s>
<s> and yet the owner of z had a demand for commodity a his demand was worthless except through the fact of his production which gave him actual wealth or purchasing power in the form of z <\s>
<s> his demand for commodity a was not the thing which employed the laborers engaged in producing a although the demand if known beforehand would cause them to produce a rather than some other articlethat is the demand of one quantity of wealth for a certain thing determines the direction taken by the owner of capital a <\s>
<s> but since the exchange is merely the form in which the demand manifests itself it is clear that the demand does not add to production and so of itself does not employ labor <\s>
<s> of course if there were no desires there would be no demand and so no production and employment of labor <\s>
<s> but we may conclude by formulating the proposition that wealth z offered for commodities a necessitates the use of other wealth than z as capital to support the operation by which those commodities a are produced <\s>
<s> it makes no difference to the existing employment of labor what want is supplied by the producers of a whether it is velvet intended for unproductive consumption or plows intended for productive consumption <\s>
<s> even if z is no longer offered in exchange for a and if then a is no longer to be made the laborers formerly occupied in producing aif warning is given of the coming change if not loss resultshaving the plant can produce something else wanted by the owner of z <\s>
<s> now into a community as here pictured all laborers supposed to be occupied and all capital employed in producing a b c ... <\s>
<s> x y z imagine the coming of a shipwrecked crew <\s>
<s> instead of exchanging z for a as before the owner of z may offer his wealth to the crew to dance for him <\s>
<s> the essential question is is more employment offered to labor by this action than the former exchange for a <\s>
<s> that is it is a question merely of distribution of wealth among the members of a community <\s>
<s> the labor engaged on a is not thrown out of employment if they have warning <\s>
<s> there is no more wealth in existence but it is differently distributed than before the crew instead of the former owner now have 1,000 of z <\s>
<s> so far as the question of employment is concerned it makes no difference on what terms the crew got it they might have been hired to stand in a row and admire the owner of z when he goes out <\s>
<s> but yet it may naturally be assumed that the crew were employed productively <\s>
<s> in this case after they have consumed the wealth z they have brought into existence articles in the place of those they consumed <\s>
<s> but although this last operation is economically more desirable for the future growth of wealth yet no more laborers for the time were employed than if the crew had merely danced <\s>
<s> the advantages or disadvantages of productive consumption are not to be discussed here <\s>
<s> it is intended however to establish the proposition that wealth paid out in wages or advanced to producers itself supports labor that wealth offered directly to laborers in this way employs more labor than when merely offered in exchange for other goods or in other words by a demand for commodities that an increased demand for commodities does not involve an increased demand for labor since this can only be created by capital <\s>
<s> the essential difference is that the owner of z in one case by exchanging goods for a did not forego his consuming power in the other case by giving z to the unemployed crew he actually went through the process of saving by foregoing his personal consumption and handing it over to the crew <\s>
<s> if the crew use it unproductively it is in the end the same as if the owner of z had done it but meanwhile the additional laborers were employed <\s>
<s> if the crew be employed productively then the saving once made will go on forever as explained above and the world will be the richer by the wealth this additional capital can create <\s>
<s> it may now be objected that if a is no longer in demand the laborers in that industry will be thrown out of employment <\s>
<s> out of that employment certainly but not out of every other <\s>

<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>
<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>
<s> the causes which bring money into or carry it out of a country 1 through the exchanges to restore the equilibrium of trade and which thereby raise its value in some countries and lower it in others are the very same causes on which the local value of money would depend if it were never imported except 2 as a merchandise and never except directly from the mines <\s>
<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>
<s> we lastly considered how the value of money itself is affected by those alterations in the state of trade which arise from alterations either in the demand and supply of commodities or in their cost of production <\s>
<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>

<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>
<s> we lastly considered how the value of money itself is affected by those alterations in the state of trade which arise from alterations either in the demand and supply of commodities or in their cost of production <\s>
<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>
<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>
<s> the causes which bring money into or carry it out of a country 1 through the exchanges to restore the equilibrium of trade and which thereby raise its value in some countries and lower it in others are the very same causes on which the local value of money would depend if it were never imported except 2 as a merchandise and never except directly from the mines <\s>
<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>

<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>
<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>
<s> the causes which bring money into or carry it out of a country 1 through the exchanges to restore the equilibrium of trade and which thereby raise its value in some countries and lower it in others are the very same causes on which the local value of money would depend if it were never imported except 2 as a merchandise and never except directly from the mines <\s>
<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>
<s> we lastly considered how the value of money itself is affected by those alterations in the state of trade which arise from alterations either in the demand and supply of commodities or in their cost of production <\s>
<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>

<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>
<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>
<s> the causes which bring money into or carry it out of a country 1 through the exchanges to restore the equilibrium of trade and which thereby raise its value in some countries and lower it in others are the very same causes on which the local value of money would depend if it were never imported except 2 as a merchandise and never except directly from the mines <\s>
<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>
<s> we lastly considered how the value of money itself is affected by those alterations in the state of trade which arise from alterations either in the demand and supply of commodities or in their cost of production <\s>
<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>

<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>
<s> we lastly considered how the value of money itself is affected by those alterations in the state of trade which arise from alterations either in the demand and supply of commodities or in their cost of production <\s>
<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>
<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>
<s> the causes which bring money into or carry it out of a country 1 through the exchanges to restore the equilibrium of trade and which thereby raise its value in some countries and lower it in others are the very same causes on which the local value of money would depend if it were never imported except 2 as a merchandise and never except directly from the mines <\s>
<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>

<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>
<s> the causes which bring money into or carry it out of a country 1 through the exchanges to restore the equilibrium of trade and which thereby raise its value in some countries and lower it in others are the very same causes on which the local value of money would depend if it were never imported except 2 as a merchandise and never except directly from the mines <\s>
<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>
<s> we lastly considered how the value of money itself is affected by those alterations in the state of trade which arise from alterations either in the demand and supply of commodities or in their cost of production <\s>
<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>

<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>
<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>
<s> the causes which bring money into or carry it out of a country 1 through the exchanges to restore the equilibrium of trade and which thereby raise its value in some countries and lower it in others are the very same causes on which the local value of money would depend if it were never imported except 2 as a merchandise and never except directly from the mines <\s>
<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>
<s> we lastly considered how the value of money itself is affected by those alterations in the state of trade which arise from alterations either in the demand and supply of commodities or in their cost of production <\s>
<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>

<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>
<s> we lastly considered how the value of money itself is affected by those alterations in the state of trade which arise from alterations either in the demand and supply of commodities or in their cost of production <\s>
<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>
<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>
<s> the causes which bring money into or carry it out of a country 1 through the exchanges to restore the equilibrium of trade and which thereby raise its value in some countries and lower it in others are the very same causes on which the local value of money would depend if it were never imported except 2 as a merchandise and never except directly from the mines <\s>
<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>

<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>
<s> the causes which bring money into or carry it out of a country 1 through the exchanges to restore the equilibrium of trade and which thereby raise its value in some countries and lower it in others are the very same causes on which the local value of money would depend if it were never imported except 2 as a merchandise and never except directly from the mines <\s>
<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>
<s> we lastly considered how the value of money itself is affected by those alterations in the state of trade which arise from alterations either in the demand and supply of commodities or in their cost of production <\s>
<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>

<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>
<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>
<s> the causes which bring money into or carry it out of a country 1 through the exchanges to restore the equilibrium of trade and which thereby raise its value in some countries and lower it in others are the very same causes on which the local value of money would depend if it were never imported except 2 as a merchandise and never except directly from the mines <\s>
<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>
<s> we lastly considered how the value of money itself is affected by those alterations in the state of trade which arise from alterations either in the demand and supply of commodities or in their cost of production <\s>
<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>

<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>
<s> we lastly considered how the value of money itself is affected by those alterations in the state of trade which arise from alterations either in the demand and supply of commodities or in their cost of production <\s>
<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>
<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>
<s> the causes which bring money into or carry it out of a country 1 through the exchanges to restore the equilibrium of trade and which thereby raise its value in some countries and lower it in others are the very same causes on which the local value of money would depend if it were never imported except 2 as a merchandise and never except directly from the mines <\s>
<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>

<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>
<s> we lastly considered how the value of money itself is affected by those alterations in the state of trade which arise from alterations either in the demand and supply of commodities or in their cost of production <\s>
<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>
<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>

<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>
<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>
<s> the causes which bring money into or carry it out of a country 1 through the exchanges to restore the equilibrium of trade and which thereby raise its value in some countries and lower it in others are the very same causes on which the local value of money would depend if it were never imported except 2 as a merchandise and never except directly from the mines <\s>
<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>
<s> we lastly considered how the value of money itself is affected by those alterations in the state of trade which arise from alterations either in the demand and supply of commodities or in their cost of production <\s>
<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>

<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>

<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>

<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>
<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>
<s> the causes which bring money into or carry it out of a country 1 through the exchanges to restore the equilibrium of trade and which thereby raise its value in some countries and lower it in others are the very same causes on which the local value of money would depend if it were never imported except 2 as a merchandise and never except directly from the mines <\s>
<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>

<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>
<s> we lastly considered how the value of money itself is affected by those alterations in the state of trade which arise from alterations either in the demand and supply of commodities or in their cost of production <\s>
<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>
<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>

<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>
<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>
<s> the causes which bring money into or carry it out of a country 1 through the exchanges to restore the equilibrium of trade and which thereby raise its value in some countries and lower it in others are the very same causes on which the local value of money would depend if it were never imported except 2 as a merchandise and never except directly from the mines <\s>
<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>
<s> we lastly considered how the value of money itself is affected by those alterations in the state of trade which arise from alterations either in the demand and supply of commodities or in their cost of production <\s>
<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>

<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>

<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>

<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>
<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>
<s> the causes which bring money into or carry it out of a country 1 through the exchanges to restore the equilibrium of trade and which thereby raise its value in some countries and lower it in others are the very same causes on which the local value of money would depend if it were never imported except 2 as a merchandise and never except directly from the mines <\s>
<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>

<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>
<s> we lastly considered how the value of money itself is affected by those alterations in the state of trade which arise from alterations either in the demand and supply of commodities or in their cost of production <\s>
<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>
<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>

<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>
<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>
<s> the causes which bring money into or carry it out of a country 1 through the exchanges to restore the equilibrium of trade and which thereby raise its value in some countries and lower it in others are the very same causes on which the local value of money would depend if it were never imported except 2 as a merchandise and never except directly from the mines <\s>
<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>
<s> we lastly considered how the value of money itself is affected by those alterations in the state of trade which arise from alterations either in the demand and supply of commodities or in their cost of production <\s>
<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>

<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>

<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>

<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>
<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>
<s> the causes which bring money into or carry it out of a country 1 through the exchanges to restore the equilibrium of trade and which thereby raise its value in some countries and lower it in others are the very same causes on which the local value of money would depend if it were never imported except 2 as a merchandise and never except directly from the mines <\s>
<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>

<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>
<s> we lastly considered how the value of money itself is affected by those alterations in the state of trade which arise from alterations either in the demand and supply of commodities or in their cost of production <\s>
<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>
<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>

<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>
<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>
<s> the causes which bring money into or carry it out of a country 1 through the exchanges to restore the equilibrium of trade and which thereby raise its value in some countries and lower it in others are the very same causes on which the local value of money would depend if it were never imported except 2 as a merchandise and never except directly from the mines <\s>
<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>
<s> we lastly considered how the value of money itself is affected by those alterations in the state of trade which arise from alterations either in the demand and supply of commodities or in their cost of production <\s>
<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>

<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>

<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>

<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>
<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>
<s> the causes which bring money into or carry it out of a country 1 through the exchanges to restore the equilibrium of trade and which thereby raise its value in some countries and lower it in others are the very same causes on which the local value of money would depend if it were never imported except 2 as a merchandise and never except directly from the mines <\s>
<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>

<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>
<s> we lastly considered how the value of money itself is affected by those alterations in the state of trade which arise from alterations either in the demand and supply of commodities or in their cost of production <\s>
<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>
<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>

<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>
<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>
<s> the causes which bring money into or carry it out of a country 1 through the exchanges to restore the equilibrium of trade and which thereby raise its value in some countries and lower it in others are the very same causes on which the local value of money would depend if it were never imported except 2 as a merchandise and never except directly from the mines <\s>
<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>
<s> we lastly considered how the value of money itself is affected by those alterations in the state of trade which arise from alterations either in the demand and supply of commodities or in their cost of production <\s>
<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>

<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>

<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>

<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>
<s> the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain <\s>
<s> when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored <\s>
<s> the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall <\s>
<s> but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on <\s>
<s> this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative <\s>
<s> now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter <\s>
<s> not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same <\s>
<s> the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade <\s>
<s> every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other <\s>
<s> in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money <\s>
<s> and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another 277   2 <\s>
<s> the preceding theorem further illustrated <\s>
<s> let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it <\s>
<s> the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all <\s>
<s> it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two <\s>
<s> the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad <\s>
<s> this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise <\s>
<s> this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting <\s>
<s> the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities <\s>
<s> if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored <\s>
<s> the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does <\s>
<s> i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries <\s>
<s> the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the money price but by that price compared with the money incomes of the consumers <\s>
<s> the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from money incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their money incomes probably diminished by the same cause <\s>
<s> the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities <\s>
<s> thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products <\s>
<s> let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one <\s>
<s> let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth <\s>
<s> the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market <\s>
<s> but this demand is of uncertain amount <\s>
<s> suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth <\s>
<s> but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement <\s>
<s> if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states <\s>
<s> these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter 278 the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo 279    gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter    of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr <\s>
<s> ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator <\s>
<s> on the principles of trade which we have before explained the same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different parts of the same country especially of a large country with various kinds of production like the united states <\s>
<s> the medium of exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in such proportions among the different parts of the united states by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of transactions which would take place if no such medium existed <\s>
<s> for this reason we find more money in the so called great financial centers because there are more exchanges of goods there <\s>
<s> in sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older and more settled districts <\s>
<s> so that there could be no worse folly than the following legislation of congress to distribute the national bank circulation    that 150,000 000 of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in the territories according to representative population    act of march 3 1865 <\s>
<s> the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity <\s>
<s> it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise <\s>
<s> the causes which bring money into or carry it out of a country 1 through the exchanges to restore the equilibrium of trade and which thereby raise its value in some countries and lower it in others are the very same causes on which the local value of money would depend if it were never imported except 2 as a merchandise and never except directly from the mines <\s>
<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>

<s> when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demandnamely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries <\s>
<s> now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value <\s>
<s> there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained <\s>
<s> when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries <\s>
<s> as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth <\s>
<s> international payments entering into the    financial account    before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or receivedsuch as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad <\s>
<s> to begin with the case of barter <\s>
<s> the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance <\s>
<s> if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state <\s>
<s> the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities <\s>
<s> the same results follow on the supposition of money <\s>
<s> commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money <\s>
<s> this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving <\s>
<s> the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country <\s>
<s> when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods <\s>
<s> the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed outthe paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price <\s>
<s> it has been seen as in chart no <\s>
<s> xiii that considering the exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the equation of international demand <\s>
<s> another element the    financial account    between the united states and foreign countries must be considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring about the equation <\s>
<s> if we had been borrowing largely of england holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much more under right and normal conditions than the imports <\s>
<s> or take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways in the united states this capital generally comes over in the form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt for a timeor in other words in order to establish the balance we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports <\s>
<s> this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the exports and so we find a period like that during and after the war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports <\s>
<s> since 1873 the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium <\s>
<s> but our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to us producing a return current to balance the excessive exports 280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an excess of exports at another and generally a later time <\s>
<s> moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the travelers <\s>
<s> the financial operations therefore between the united states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking the equation between our exports and imports <\s>
<s> as formulated by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes 281 the equation of international demand should be stated more broadly as follows    the state of international demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign liabilities    if we were a great lending instead of a great borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess of imports <\s>
<s> influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade <\s>
<s> variations in the exchange which originate in the currency <\s>
<s> in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter <\s>
<s> we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter <\s>
<s> we lastly considered how the value of money itself is affected by those alterations in the state of trade which arise from alterations either in the demand and supply of commodities or in their cost of production <\s>
<s> it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money <\s>
<s> gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production <\s>
<s> the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary <\s>
<s> it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium <\s>
<s> it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with <\s>
<s> these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness <\s>
<s> what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value <\s>
<s> effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of bank notes or other substitutes for money <\s>
<s> let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder <\s>
<s> the natural effect would be a rise of prices <\s>
<s> this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world <\s>
<s> the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries <\s>
<s> for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally <\s>
<s> this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production <\s>
<s> the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale <\s>
<s> the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries <\s>
<s> the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which bank notes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals <\s>
<s> suppose 282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200,000 000 and that suddenly 200,000 000 of bank notes were sent into circulation <\s>
<s> if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200,000 000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices <\s>
<s> but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or money lenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as e g greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities <\s>
<s> the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly <\s>
<s> exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated <\s>
<s> a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states <\s>

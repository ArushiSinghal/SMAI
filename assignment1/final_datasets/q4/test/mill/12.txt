<s> when the state of trade holds out no particular temptation to make large purchases on credit dealers will use only a small portion of the credit power and it will depend only on convenience whether the portion which they use will be taken in one form or in another <\s>
<s> one single exertion of the credit power in the form of 1 book credit is only the foundation of a single purchase but if 2 a bill is drawn that same portion of credit may serve for as many purchases as the number of times the bill changes hands while 3 every bank note issued renders the credit of the banker a purchasing power to that amount in the hands of all the successive holders without impairing any power they may possess of effecting purchases on their own credit <\s>
<s> credit in short has exactly the same purchasing power with money and as money tells upon prices not simply in proportion to its amount but to its amount multiplied by the number of times it changes hands so also does credit and credit transferable from hand to hand is in that proportion more potent than credit which only performs one purchase <\s>
<s> there is a form of credit transactions 4 by checks on bankers and transfers in a bankers books which is exactly parallel in every respect to bank notes giving equal facilities to an extension of credit and capable of acting on prices quite as powerfully <\s>
<s> a bank instead of lending its notes to a merchant or dealer might open an account with him and credit the account with the sum it had agreed to advance on an understanding that he should not draw out that sum in any other mode than by drawing checks against it in favor of those to whom he had occasion to make payments <\s>
<s> these checks might possibly even pass from hand to hand like bank notes more commonly however the receiver would pay them into the hands of his own banker and when he wanted the money would draw a fresh check against it and hence an objector may urge that as the original check would very soon be presented for payment when it must be paid either in notes or in coin notes or coin to an equal amount must be provided as the ultimate means of liquidation <\s>
<s> it is not so however <\s>
<s> the person to whom the check is transferred may perhaps deal with the same banker and the check may return to the very bank on which it was drawn <\s>
<s> this is very often the case in country districts if so no payment will be called for but a simple transfer in the bankers books will settle the transaction <\s>
<s> if the check is paid into a different bank it will not be presented for payment but liquidated by set off against other checks and in a state of circumstances favorable to a general extension of banking credits a banker who has granted more credit and has therefore more checks drawn on him will also have more checks on other bankers paid to him and will only have to provide notes or cash for the payment of balances for which purpose the ordinary reserve of prudent bankers one third of their liabilities will abundantly suffice <\s>
<s> on what the use of credit depends <\s>
<s> the credit given to any one by those with whom he deals does not depend on the quantity of bank notes or coin in circulation at the time but on their opinion of his solvency <\s>
<s> if any consideration of a more general character enters into their calculation it is only in a time of pressure on the loan market when they are not certain of being themselves able to obtain the credit on which they have been accustomed to rely and even then what they look to is the general state of the loan market and not preconceived theory apart the amount of bank notes <\s>
<s> so far as to the willingness to give credit <\s>
<s> and the willingness of a dealer to use his credit depends on his expectations of gain that is on his opinion of the probable future price of his commodity an opinion grounded either on the rise or fall already going on or on his prospective judgment respecting the supply and the rate of consumption <\s>
<s> when a dealer extends his purchases beyond his immediate means of payment engaging to pay at a specified time he does so in the expectation either that the transaction will have terminated favorably before that time arrives or that he shall then be in possession of sufficient funds from the proceeds of his other transactions <\s>
<s> the fulfillment of these expectations depends upon prices but not specially upon the amount of bank notes <\s>
<s> it is obvious however that prices do not depend on money but on purchases <\s>
<s> money left with a banker and not drawn against or drawn against for other purposes than buying commodities has no effect on prices any more than credit which is not used <\s>
<s> credit which is used to purchase commodities affects prices in the same manner as money <\s>
<s> money and credit are thus exactly on a par in their effect on prices <\s>
<s> it is often seen in our large cities that money is very plentiful but no one seems to wish its use that is no one with safe securities <\s>

<s> it is impossible to make people invest simply by increasing the number of counters by which commodities are exchanged against each other that is by increasing the money <\s>
<s> the reason why more credit is wanted is because men see that increased production is possible of a kind that will find other commodities ready to be offered i e demand in exchange for that production <\s>
<s> normal credit therefore on a healthy basis increases and slackens with the activity or dullness of trade <\s>
<s> speculation or the wild extension of credit on the other hand is apt to be begotten by a plethora of money which has induced low rates for loans and moves with the uncertain waves of popular impression <\s>

<s> what is essential to the idea of money <\s>
<s> there has been a great amount of discussion and argument on the question whether several of these forms of credit and in particular whether bank notes ought to be considered as money <\s>

<s> an instrument which would be deprived of all value by the insolvency of a corporation can not be money in any sense in which money is opposed to credit <\s>
<s> it either is not money or it is money and credit too <\s>
<s> it would seem from all study of the essentials of money book iii chapter iv that the necessary part of the idea of money is that it should have value in itself <\s>

<s> when the state of trade holds out no particular temptation to make large purchases on credit dealers will use only a small portion of the credit power and it will depend only on convenience whether the portion which they use will be taken in one form or in another <\s>
<s> one single exertion of the credit power in the form of 1 book credit is only the foundation of a single purchase but if 2 a bill is drawn that same portion of credit may serve for as many purchases as the number of times the bill changes hands while 3 every bank note issued renders the credit of the banker a purchasing power to that amount in the hands of all the successive holders without impairing any power they may possess of effecting purchases on their own credit <\s>
<s> credit in short has exactly the same purchasing power with money and as money tells upon prices not simply in proportion to its amount but to its amount multiplied by the number of times it changes hands so also does credit and credit transferable from hand to hand is in that proportion more potent than credit which only performs one purchase <\s>
<s> there is a form of credit transactions 4 by checks on bankers and transfers in a bankers books which is exactly parallel in every respect to bank notes giving equal facilities to an extension of credit and capable of acting on prices quite as powerfully <\s>
<s> a bank instead of lending its notes to a merchant or dealer might open an account with him and credit the account with the sum it had agreed to advance on an understanding that he should not draw out that sum in any other mode than by drawing checks against it in favor of those to whom he had occasion to make payments <\s>
<s> these checks might possibly even pass from hand to hand like bank notes more commonly however the receiver would pay them into the hands of his own banker and when he wanted the money would draw a fresh check against it and hence an objector may urge that as the original check would very soon be presented for payment when it must be paid either in notes or in coin notes or coin to an equal amount must be provided as the ultimate means of liquidation <\s>
<s> it is not so however <\s>
<s> the person to whom the check is transferred may perhaps deal with the same banker and the check may return to the very bank on which it was drawn <\s>
<s> this is very often the case in country districts if so no payment will be called for but a simple transfer in the bankers books will settle the transaction <\s>
<s> if the check is paid into a different bank it will not be presented for payment but liquidated by set off against other checks and in a state of circumstances favorable to a general extension of banking credits a banker who has granted more credit and has therefore more checks drawn on him will also have more checks on other bankers paid to him and will only have to provide notes or cash for the payment of balances for which purpose the ordinary reserve of prudent bankers one third of their liabilities will abundantly suffice <\s>
<s> on what the use of credit depends <\s>
<s> the credit given to any one by those with whom he deals does not depend on the quantity of bank notes or coin in circulation at the time but on their opinion of his solvency <\s>
<s> if any consideration of a more general character enters into their calculation it is only in a time of pressure on the loan market when they are not certain of being themselves able to obtain the credit on which they have been accustomed to rely and even then what they look to is the general state of the loan market and not preconceived theory apart the amount of bank notes <\s>
<s> so far as to the willingness to give credit <\s>
<s> and the willingness of a dealer to use his credit depends on his expectations of gain that is on his opinion of the probable future price of his commodity an opinion grounded either on the rise or fall already going on or on his prospective judgment respecting the supply and the rate of consumption <\s>
<s> when a dealer extends his purchases beyond his immediate means of payment engaging to pay at a specified time he does so in the expectation either that the transaction will have terminated favorably before that time arrives or that he shall then be in possession of sufficient funds from the proceeds of his other transactions <\s>
<s> the fulfillment of these expectations depends upon prices but not specially upon the amount of bank notes <\s>
<s> it is obvious however that prices do not depend on money but on purchases <\s>
<s> money left with a banker and not drawn against or drawn against for other purposes than buying commodities has no effect on prices any more than credit which is not used <\s>
<s> credit which is used to purchase commodities affects prices in the same manner as money <\s>
<s> money and credit are thus exactly on a par in their effect on prices <\s>
<s> it is often seen in our large cities that money is very plentiful but no one seems to wish its use that is no one with safe securities <\s>

<s> it is impossible to make people invest simply by increasing the number of counters by which commodities are exchanged against each other that is by increasing the money <\s>
<s> the reason why more credit is wanted is because men see that increased production is possible of a kind that will find other commodities ready to be offered i e demand in exchange for that production <\s>
<s> normal credit therefore on a healthy basis increases and slackens with the activity or dullness of trade <\s>
<s> speculation or the wild extension of credit on the other hand is apt to be begotten by a plethora of money which has induced low rates for loans and moves with the uncertain waves of popular impression <\s>

<s> what is essential to the idea of money <\s>
<s> there has been a great amount of discussion and argument on the question whether several of these forms of credit and in particular whether bank notes ought to be considered as money <\s>
<s> it seems to be an essential part of the idea of money that it be legal tender <\s>
<s> an inconvertible paper which is legal tender is universally admitted to be money in the french language the phrase papier monnaie actually means inconvertibility convertible notes being merely billets  porteur <\s>
<s> an instrument which would be deprived of all value by the insolvency of a corporation can not be money in any sense in which money is opposed to credit <\s>
<s> it either is not money or it is money and credit too <\s>
<s> it would seem from all study of the essentials of money book iii chapter iv that the necessary part of the idea of money is that it should have value in itself <\s>
<s> no one parts with valuable commodities for a medium of exchange which does not possess value and we have seen that legislatures can not control the natural value of even the precious metals by giving them legal tender power <\s>
<s> much less could it be done for paper money <\s>
<s> paper therefore may as an instrument of credit be a substitute for money but in accordance with the above test it can not properly be considered as money in the full sense <\s>

<s> it is practically of little importance however what we include under money so long as its functions are well understood it is merely a question of nomenclature and need not disturb us <\s>
<s> what acts on prices is credit in whatever shape given <\s>
<s> having now formed a general idea of the modes in which credit is made available as a substitute for money we have to consider in what manner the use of these substitutes affects the value of money or what is equivalent the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> it is hardly necessary to say that the permanent value of moneythe natural and average prices of commoditiesare not in question here <\s>
<s> these are determined by the cost of producing or of obtaining the precious metals <\s>

<s> it does not indeed follow that credit will be more used because it can be <\s>
<s> when the state of trade holds out no particular temptation to make large purchases on credit dealers will use only a small portion of the credit power and it will depend only on convenience whether the portion which they use will be taken in one form or in another <\s>
<s> one single exertion of the credit power in the form of 1 book credit is only the foundation of a single purchase but if 2 a bill is drawn that same portion of credit may serve for as many purchases as the number of times the bill changes hands while 3 every bank note issued renders the credit of the banker a purchasing power to that amount in the hands of all the successive holders without impairing any power they may possess of effecting purchases on their own credit <\s>
<s> credit in short has exactly the same purchasing power with money and as money tells upon prices not simply in proportion to its amount but to its amount multiplied by the number of times it changes hands so also does credit and credit transferable from hand to hand is in that proportion more potent than credit which only performs one purchase <\s>
<s> there is a form of credit transactions 4 by checks on bankers and transfers in a bankers books which is exactly parallel in every respect to bank notes giving equal facilities to an extension of credit and capable of acting on prices quite as powerfully <\s>
<s> a bank instead of lending its notes to a merchant or dealer might open an account with him and credit the account with the sum it had agreed to advance on an understanding that he should not draw out that sum in any other mode than by drawing checks against it in favor of those to whom he had occasion to make payments <\s>
<s> these checks might possibly even pass from hand to hand like bank notes more commonly however the receiver would pay them into the hands of his own banker and when he wanted the money would draw a fresh check against it and hence an objector may urge that as the original check would very soon be presented for payment when it must be paid either in notes or in coin notes or coin to an equal amount must be provided as the ultimate means of liquidation <\s>
<s> it is not so however <\s>
<s> the person to whom the check is transferred may perhaps deal with the same banker and the check may return to the very bank on which it was drawn <\s>
<s> this is very often the case in country districts if so no payment will be called for but a simple transfer in the bankers books will settle the transaction <\s>
<s> if the check is paid into a different bank it will not be presented for payment but liquidated by set off against other checks and in a state of circumstances favorable to a general extension of banking credits a banker who has granted more credit and has therefore more checks drawn on him will also have more checks on other bankers paid to him and will only have to provide notes or cash for the payment of balances for which purpose the ordinary reserve of prudent bankers one third of their liabilities will abundantly suffice <\s>
<s> on what the use of credit depends <\s>
<s> the credit given to any one by those with whom he deals does not depend on the quantity of bank notes or coin in circulation at the time but on their opinion of his solvency <\s>
<s> if any consideration of a more general character enters into their calculation it is only in a time of pressure on the loan market when they are not certain of being themselves able to obtain the credit on which they have been accustomed to rely and even then what they look to is the general state of the loan market and not preconceived theory apart the amount of bank notes <\s>
<s> so far as to the willingness to give credit <\s>
<s> and the willingness of a dealer to use his credit depends on his expectations of gain that is on his opinion of the probable future price of his commodity an opinion grounded either on the rise or fall already going on or on his prospective judgment respecting the supply and the rate of consumption <\s>
<s> when a dealer extends his purchases beyond his immediate means of payment engaging to pay at a specified time he does so in the expectation either that the transaction will have terminated favorably before that time arrives or that he shall then be in possession of sufficient funds from the proceeds of his other transactions <\s>
<s> the fulfillment of these expectations depends upon prices but not specially upon the amount of bank notes <\s>
<s> it is obvious however that prices do not depend on money but on purchases <\s>
<s> money left with a banker and not drawn against or drawn against for other purposes than buying commodities has no effect on prices any more than credit which is not used <\s>
<s> credit which is used to purchase commodities affects prices in the same manner as money <\s>
<s> money and credit are thus exactly on a par in their effect on prices <\s>
<s> it is often seen in our large cities that money is very plentiful but no one seems to wish its use that is no one with safe securities <\s>
<s> inability to find investments and to find industries in which the rate of profit is satisfactoryall of which depends on the business character and activity of the peoplewill prevent credit from being used no matter how many bank notes or greenbacks or how much gold there is in the country <\s>
<s> it is impossible to make people invest simply by increasing the number of counters by which commodities are exchanged against each other that is by increasing the money <\s>
<s> the reason why more credit is wanted is because men see that increased production is possible of a kind that will find other commodities ready to be offered i e demand in exchange for that production <\s>
<s> normal credit therefore on a healthy basis increases and slackens with the activity or dullness of trade <\s>
<s> speculation or the wild extension of credit on the other hand is apt to be begotten by a plethora of money which has induced low rates for loans and moves with the uncertain waves of popular impression <\s>
<s> by normal credit we mean that the wealth represented by the credit is really at the disposal of the borrowers in a crisis the quantity of wealth supposed to be represented by credit is very much greater than that at the disposal of the lenders 246   6 <\s>
<s> what is essential to the idea of money <\s>
<s> there has been a great amount of discussion and argument on the question whether several of these forms of credit and in particular whether bank notes ought to be considered as money <\s>
<s> it seems to be an essential part of the idea of money that it be legal tender <\s>
<s> an inconvertible paper which is legal tender is universally admitted to be money in the french language the phrase papier monnaie actually means inconvertibility convertible notes being merely billets  porteur <\s>
<s> an instrument which would be deprived of all value by the insolvency of a corporation can not be money in any sense in which money is opposed to credit <\s>
<s> it either is not money or it is money and credit too <\s>
<s> it would seem from all study of the essentials of money book iii chapter iv that the necessary part of the idea of money is that it should have value in itself <\s>
<s> no one parts with valuable commodities for a medium of exchange which does not possess value and we have seen that legislatures can not control the natural value of even the precious metals by giving them legal tender power <\s>
<s> much less could it be done for paper money <\s>
<s> paper therefore may as an instrument of credit be a substitute for money but in accordance with the above test it can not properly be considered as money in the full sense <\s>
<s> of course paper money checks etc perform some of the functions of money equally well with the precious metals <\s>
<s> walker holds that anything is money which performs money work but he excludes checks from his catalogue of things which may serve as money <\s>
<s> it is practically of little importance however what we include under money so long as its functions are well understood it is merely a question of nomenclature and need not disturb us <\s>
<s> what acts on prices is credit in whatever shape given <\s>
<s> having now formed a general idea of the modes in which credit is made available as a substitute for money we have to consider in what manner the use of these substitutes affects the value of money or what is equivalent the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> it is hardly necessary to say that the permanent value of moneythe natural and average prices of commoditiesare not in question here <\s>
<s> these are determined by the cost of producing or of obtaining the precious metals <\s>
<s> an ounce of gold or silver will in the long run exchange for as much of every other commodity as can be produced or imported at the same cost with itself <\s>
<s> and an order or note of hand or bill payable at sight for an ounce of gold while the credit of the giver is unimpaired is worth neither more nor less than the gold itself <\s>
<s> it is not however with ultimate or average but with immediate and temporary prices that we are now concerned <\s>
<s> these as we have seen may deviate very widely from the standard of cost of production <\s>
<s> among other causes of fluctuation one we have found to be the quantity of money in circulation <\s>
<s> other things being the same an increase of the money in circulation raises prices a diminution lowers them <\s>
<s> if more money is thrown into circulation than the quantity which can circulate at a value conformable to its cost of production the value of money so long as the excess lasts will remain below the standard of cost of production and general prices will be sustained above the natural rate <\s>
<s> but we have now found that there are other things such as bank notes bills of exchange and checks which circulate as money and perform all the functions of it and the question arises do these various substitutes operate on prices in the same manner as money itself <\s>
<s> i apprehend that bank notes bills or checks as such do not act on prices at all <\s>

<s> on what the use of credit depends <\s>
<s> the credit given to any one by those with whom he deals does not depend on the quantity of bank notes or coin in circulation at the time but on their opinion of his solvency <\s>

<s> so far as to the willingness to give credit <\s>
<s> and the willingness of a dealer to use his credit depends on his expectations of gain that is on his opinion of the probable future price of his commodity an opinion grounded either on the rise or fall already going on or on his prospective judgment respecting the supply and the rate of consumption <\s>

<s> it is obvious however that prices do not depend on money but on purchases <\s>

<s> there has been a great amount of discussion and argument on the question whether several of these forms of credit and in particular whether bank notes ought to be considered as money <\s>

<s> much less could it be done for paper money <\s>
<s> paper therefore may as an instrument of credit be a substitute for money but in accordance with the above test it can not properly be considered as money in the full sense <\s>

<s> it is practically of little importance however what we include under money so long as its functions are well understood it is merely a question of nomenclature and need not disturb us <\s>
<s> what acts on prices is credit in whatever shape given <\s>
<s> having now formed a general idea of the modes in which credit is made available as a substitute for money we have to consider in what manner the use of these substitutes affects the value of money or what is equivalent the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> it is hardly necessary to say that the permanent value of moneythe natural and average prices of commoditiesare not in question here <\s>
<s> these are determined by the cost of producing or of obtaining the precious metals <\s>

<s> it is not however with ultimate or average but with immediate and temporary prices that we are now concerned <\s>
<s> these as we have seen may deviate very widely from the standard of cost of production <\s>
<s> among other causes of fluctuation one we have found to be the quantity of money in circulation <\s>
<s> other things being the same an increase of the money in circulation raises prices a diminution lowers them <\s>
<s> if more money is thrown into circulation than the quantity which can circulate at a value conformable to its cost of production the value of money so long as the excess lasts will remain below the standard of cost of production and general prices will be sustained above the natural rate <\s>
<s> but we have now found that there are other things such as bank notes bills of exchange and checks which circulate as money and perform all the functions of it and the question arises do these various substitutes operate on prices in the same manner as money itself <\s>
<s> i apprehend that bank notes bills or checks as such do not act on prices at all <\s>

<s> this is very often the case in country districts if so no payment will be called for but a simple transfer in the bankers books will settle the transaction <\s>
<s> if the check is paid into a different bank it will not be presented for payment but liquidated by set off against other checks and in a state of circumstances favorable to a general extension of banking credits a banker who has granted more credit and has therefore more checks drawn on him will also have more checks on other bankers paid to him and will only have to provide notes or cash for the payment of balances for which purpose the ordinary reserve of prudent bankers one third of their liabilities will abundantly suffice <\s>
<s> on what the use of credit depends <\s>
<s> the credit given to any one by those with whom he deals does not depend on the quantity of bank notes or coin in circulation at the time but on their opinion of his solvency <\s>
<s> if any consideration of a more general character enters into their calculation it is only in a time of pressure on the loan market when they are not certain of being themselves able to obtain the credit on which they have been accustomed to rely and even then what they look to is the general state of the loan market and not preconceived theory apart the amount of bank notes <\s>
<s> so far as to the willingness to give credit <\s>
<s> and the willingness of a dealer to use his credit depends on his expectations of gain that is on his opinion of the probable future price of his commodity an opinion grounded either on the rise or fall already going on or on his prospective judgment respecting the supply and the rate of consumption <\s>
<s> when a dealer extends his purchases beyond his immediate means of payment engaging to pay at a specified time he does so in the expectation either that the transaction will have terminated favorably before that time arrives or that he shall then be in possession of sufficient funds from the proceeds of his other transactions <\s>
<s> the fulfillment of these expectations depends upon prices but not specially upon the amount of bank notes <\s>
<s> it is obvious however that prices do not depend on money but on purchases <\s>
<s> money left with a banker and not drawn against or drawn against for other purposes than buying commodities has no effect on prices any more than credit which is not used <\s>
<s> credit which is used to purchase commodities affects prices in the same manner as money <\s>
<s> money and credit are thus exactly on a par in their effect on prices <\s>

<s> it is impossible to make people invest simply by increasing the number of counters by which commodities are exchanged against each other that is by increasing the money <\s>
<s> the reason why more credit is wanted is because men see that increased production is possible of a kind that will find other commodities ready to be offered i e demand in exchange for that production <\s>
<s> normal credit therefore on a healthy basis increases and slackens with the activity or dullness of trade <\s>
<s> speculation or the wild extension of credit on the other hand is apt to be begotten by a plethora of money which has induced low rates for loans and moves with the uncertain waves of popular impression <\s>

<s> what is essential to the idea of money <\s>
<s> there has been a great amount of discussion and argument on the question whether several of these forms of credit and in particular whether bank notes ought to be considered as money <\s>
<s> it seems to be an essential part of the idea of money that it be legal tender <\s>
<s> an inconvertible paper which is legal tender is universally admitted to be money in the french language the phrase papier monnaie actually means inconvertibility convertible notes being merely billets  porteur <\s>
<s> an instrument which would be deprived of all value by the insolvency of a corporation can not be money in any sense in which money is opposed to credit <\s>
<s> it either is not money or it is money and credit too <\s>
<s> it would seem from all study of the essentials of money book iii chapter iv that the necessary part of the idea of money is that it should have value in itself <\s>
<s> no one parts with valuable commodities for a medium of exchange which does not possess value and we have seen that legislatures can not control the natural value of even the precious metals by giving them legal tender power <\s>
<s> much less could it be done for paper money <\s>
<s> paper therefore may as an instrument of credit be a substitute for money but in accordance with the above test it can not properly be considered as money in the full sense <\s>
<s> of course paper money checks etc perform some of the functions of money equally well with the precious metals <\s>
<s> walker holds that anything is money which performs money work but he excludes checks from his catalogue of things which may serve as money <\s>
<s> it is practically of little importance however what we include under money so long as its functions are well understood it is merely a question of nomenclature and need not disturb us <\s>
<s> what acts on prices is credit in whatever shape given <\s>
<s> having now formed a general idea of the modes in which credit is made available as a substitute for money we have to consider in what manner the use of these substitutes affects the value of money or what is equivalent the prices of commodities <\s>
<s> it is hardly necessary to say that the permanent value of moneythe natural and average prices of commoditiesare not in question here <\s>
<s> these are determined by the cost of producing or of obtaining the precious metals <\s>
<s> an ounce of gold or silver will in the long run exchange for as much of every other commodity as can be produced or imported at the same cost with itself <\s>
<s> and an order or note of hand or bill payable at sight for an ounce of gold while the credit of the giver is unimpaired is worth neither more nor less than the gold itself <\s>
<s> it is not however with ultimate or average but with immediate and temporary prices that we are now concerned <\s>
<s> these as we have seen may deviate very widely from the standard of cost of production <\s>
<s> among other causes of fluctuation one we have found to be the quantity of money in circulation <\s>
<s> other things being the same an increase of the money in circulation raises prices a diminution lowers them <\s>
<s> if more money is thrown into circulation than the quantity which can circulate at a value conformable to its cost of production the value of money so long as the excess lasts will remain below the standard of cost of production and general prices will be sustained above the natural rate <\s>
<s> but we have now found that there are other things such as bank notes bills of exchange and checks which circulate as money and perform all the functions of it and the question arises do these various substitutes operate on prices in the same manner as money itself <\s>
<s> i apprehend that bank notes bills or checks as such do not act on prices at all <\s>
<s> what does act on prices is credit in whatever shape given and whether it gives rise to any transferable instruments capable of passing into circulation or not <\s>
<s> credit a purchasing power similar to money <\s>
<s> money acts upon prices in no other way than by being tendered in exchange for commodities <\s>
<s> the demand which influences the prices of commodities consists of the money offered for them <\s>
<s> money not in circulation has no effect on prices <\s>
<s> in the case however of payment by checks the purchases are at any rate made though not with the money in the buyers possession yet with money to which he has a right <\s>
<s> but he may make purchases with money which he only expects to have or even only pretends to expect <\s>
<s> he may obtain goods in return for his acceptances payable at a future time or on his note of hand or on a simple book creditthat is on a mere promise to pay <\s>
<s> all these purchases have exactly the same effect on price as if they were made with ready money <\s>
<s> the amount of purchasing power which a person can exercise is composed of all the money in his possession or due to him and of all his credit <\s>
<s> for exercising the whole of this power he finds a sufficient motive only under peculiar circumstances but he always possesses it and the portion of it which he at any time does exercise is the measure of the effect which he produces on price <\s>
<s> suppose that in the expectation that some commodity will rise in price he determines not only to invest in it all his ready money but to take up on credit from the producers or importers as much of it as their opinion of his resources will enable him to obtain <\s>
<s> every one must see that by thus acting he produces a greater effect on price than if he limited his purchases to the money he has actually in hand <\s>
<s> he creates a demand for the article to the full amount of his money and credit taken together and raises the price proportionally to both <\s>
<s> and this effect is produced though none of the written instruments called substitutes for currency may be called into existence though the transaction may give rise to no bill of exchange nor to the issue of a single bank note <\s>

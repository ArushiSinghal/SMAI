<s> what the production of a thing costs to its producer or its series of producers is the labor expended in producing it <\s>
<s> if we consider as the producer the capitalist who makes the advances the word labor may be replaced by the word wages what the produce costs to him is the wages which he has had to pay <\s>
<s> at the first glance indeed this seems to be only a part of his outlay since he has not only paid wages to laborers but has likewise provided them with tools materials and perhaps buildings <\s>
<s> these tools materials and buildings however were produced by labor and capital and their value like that of the article to the production of which they are subservient depends on cost of production which again is resolvable into labor <\s>
<s> the cost of production of broadcloth does not wholly consist in the wages of weavers which alone are directly paid by the cloth manufacturer <\s>
<s> it consists also of the wages of spinners and wool combers and it may be added of shepherds all of which the clothier has paid for in the price of yarn <\s>
<s> it consists too of the wages of builders and brick makers which he has reimbursed in the contract price of erecting his factory <\s>
<s> it partly consists of the wages of machine makers iron founders and miners <\s>
<s> and to these must be added the wages of the carriers who transported any of the means and appliances of the production to the place where they were to be used and the product itself to the place where it is to be sold <\s>
<s> confirmation is here given in the above words of the opinion that in mr <\s>
<s> mills mind cost of production was looked at wholly from the stand point of the capitalist and was identical with cost of labor to the capitalist <\s>
<s> the value of commodities therefore depends principally we shall presently see whether it depends solely on the quantity of labor required for their production including in the idea of production that of conveyance to the market <\s>
<s> but since the cost of production to the capitalist is not labor but wages and since wages may be either greater or less the quantity of labor being the same it would seem that the value of the product can not be determined solely by the quantity of labor but by the quantity together with the remuneration and that values must partly depend on wages <\s>
<s> now the relation of one thing to another can not be altered by any cause which affects them both alike <\s>
<s> a rise or fall of general wages is a fact which affects all commodities in the same manner and therefore affords no reason why they should exchange for each other in one rather than in another proportion <\s>
<s> though there is no such thing as a general rise of values there is such a thing as a general rise of prices <\s>
<s> as soon as we form distinctly the idea of values we see that high or low wages can have nothing to do with them but that high wages make high prices is a popular and widely spread opinion <\s>
<s> the whole amount of error involved in this proposition can only be seen thoroughly when we come to the theory of money at present we need only say that if it be true there can be no such thing as a real rise of wages for if wages could not rise without a proportional rise of the price of everything they could not for any substantial purpose rise at all <\s>
<s> it must be remembered too that general high prices even supposing them to exist can be of no use to a producer or dealer considered as such for if they increase his money returns they increase in the same degree all his expenses <\s>
<s> there is no mode in which capitalists can compensate themselves for a high cost of labor through any action on values or prices <\s>
<s> it can not be prevented from taking its effect in low profits <\s>
<s> if the laborers really get more that is get the produce of more labor a smaller percentage must remain for profit <\s>
<s> the monopolist can fix the value as high as he pleases short of what the consumer either could not or would not pay but he can only do so by limiting the supply <\s>
<s> monopoly value therefore does not depend on any peculiar principle but is a mere variety of the ordinary case of demand and supply <\s>
<s> again though there are few commodities which are at all times and forever unsusceptible of increase of supply any commodity whatever may be temporarily so and with some commodities this is habitually the case <\s>
<s> agricultural produce for example can not be increased in quantity before the next harvest the quantity of corn already existing in the world is all that can be had for sometimes a year to come <\s>
<s> during that interval corn is practically assimilated to things of which the quantity can not be increased <\s>
<s> in the case of most commodities it requires a certain time to increase their quantity and if the demand increases then until a corresponding supply can be brought forward that is until the supply can accommodate itself to the demand the value will so rise as to accommodate the demand to the supply <\s>
<s> there is another case the exact converse of this <\s>
<s> there are some articles of which the supply may be indefinitely increased but can not be rapidly diminished <\s>
<s> there are things so durable that the quantity in existence is at all times very great in comparison with the annual produce <\s>
<s> gold and the more durable metals are things of this sort and also houses <\s>
<s> the supply of such things might be at once diminished by destroying them but to do this could only be the interest of the possessor if he had a monopoly of the article and could repay himself for the destruction of a part by the increased value of the remainder <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such things may continue for a long time so low either from excess of supply or falling off in the demand as to put a complete stop to further production the diminution of supply by wearing out being so slow a process that a long time is requisite even under a total suspension of production to restore the original value <\s>
<s> during that interval the value will be regulated solely by supply and demand and will rise very gradually as the existing stock wears out until there is again a remunerating value and production resumes its course <\s>
<s> the total value of gold and silver in the world is variously estimated at from 10,000 000,000 to 14,000 000,000 while the annual production of both gold and silver in the world during 1882 211 was only 212,000 000 <\s>
<s> the loss of gold by abrasion is about 1/1000 annually and of silver about 1/700 but much depends on the size of the coin <\s>
<s> a change in the annual production of the precious metals can have a perceptible effect on their value only after such a time as will permit the change to affect the existing quantity in a way somewhat comparable with its previous amount <\s>
<s> the quantity however of wheat produced is nearly all consumed between harvests and the annual supply bears a very large ratio to the existing quantity <\s>
<s> consequently the price of wheat will be very seriously affected by the quantity coming from the annual product <\s>
<s> finally there are commodities of which though capable of being increased or diminished to a great and even an unlimited extent the value never depends upon anything but demand and supply <\s>
<s> this is the case in particular with the commodity labor of the value of which we have treated copiously in the preceding book and there are many cases besides in which we shall find it necessary to call in this principle to solve difficult questions of exchange value <\s>

<s> commodities which are susceptible of indefinite multiplication without increase of cost <\s>
<s> law of their value cost of production <\s>
<s> when the production of a commodity is the effect of labor and expenditure whether the commodity is susceptible of unlimited multiplication or not there is a minimum value which is the essential condition of its being permanently produced <\s>
<s> the value at any particular time is the result of supply and demand and is always that which is necessary to create a market for the existing supply <\s>
<s> but unless that value is sufficient to repay the cost of production and to afford besides the ordinary expectation of profit the commodity will not continue to be produced <\s>
<s> capitalists will not go on permanently producing at a loss <\s>
<s> when such profit is evidently not to be had if people do not actually withdraw their capital they at least abstain from replacing it when consumed <\s>
<s> the cost of production together with the ordinary profit may therefore be called the necessary price or value of all things made by labor and capital <\s>
<s> nobody willingly produces in the prospect of loss <\s>
<s> when a commodity is not only made by labor and capital but can be made by them in indefinite quantity this necessary value the minimum with which the producers will be content is also if competition is free and active the maximum which they can expect <\s>
<s> if the value of a commodity is such that it repays the cost of production not only with the customary but with a higher rate of profit capital rushes to share in this extra gain and by increasing the supply of the article reduces its value <\s>
<s> this is not a mere supposition or surmise but a fact familiar to those conversant with commercial operations <\s>
<s> whenever a new line of business presents itself offering a hope of unusual profits and whenever any established trade or manufacture is believed to be yielding a greater profit than customary there is sure to be in a short time so large a production or importation of the commodity as not only destroys the extra profit but generally goes beyond the mark and sinks the value as much too low as it had before been raised too high until the over supply is corrected by a total or partial suspension of further production <\s>
<s> as already intimated 212 these variations in the quantity produced do not presuppose or require that any person should change his employment <\s>
<s> those whose business is thriving increase their produce by availing themselves more largely of their credit while those who are not making the ordinary profit restrict their operations and in manufacturing phrase work short time <\s>
<s> in this mode is surely and speedily effected the equalization not of profits perhaps but of the expectations of profit in different occupations <\s>
<s> as a general rule then things tend to exchange for one another at such values as will enable each producer to be repaid the cost of production with the ordinary profit in other words such as will give to all producers the same rate of profit on their outlay <\s>
<s> but in order that the profit may be equal where the outlay that is the cost of production is equal things must on the average exchange for one another in the ratio of their cost of production things of which the cost of production is the same must be of the same value <\s>
<s> mill has here used cost of production almost exactly in the sense of cost of labor and as excluding profit while in the next chapter he includes some part of profit in the analysis <\s>

<s> having thus pointed out what is mr <\s>
<s> mills conception of cost of production it will remain for us in the next chapter to consider whether any other view of it is more satisfactory <\s>
<s> adam smith and ricardo have called that value of a thing which is proportional to its cost of production its natural value or its natural price <\s>
<s> they meant by this the point about which the value oscillates and to which it always tends to return the center value toward which as adam smith expresses it the market value of a thing is constantly gravitating and any deviation from which is but a temporary irregularity which the moment it exists sets forces in motion tending to correct it <\s>
<s> on an average of years sufficient to enable the oscillations on one side of the central line to be compensated by those on the other the market value agrees with the natural value but it very seldom coincides exactly with it at any particular time <\s>
<s> the sea everywhere tends to a level but it never is at an exact level its surface is always ruffled by waves and often agitated by storms <\s>

<s> the value of these commodities confirm in the long run to their cost of production through the operation of demand and supply <\s>
<s> the latent influence by which the values of things are made to conform in the long run to the cost of production is the variation that would otherwise take place in the supply of the commodity <\s>
<s> the supply would be increased if the thing continued to sell above the ratio of its cost of production and would be diminished if it fell below that ratio <\s>
<s> if one dollar covers the expense of making one spade then when a spade by virtue of a sudden demand rises in value to one dollar and ten cents the manufacturers get an extra profit of ten cents <\s>
<s> this could not long remain so because other capital would enter this industry and so increase the supply that one spade would sell for only one dollar then all would receive the average profit <\s>
<s> if owing to a cessation of demand for spades the price fell to ninety cents then the manufacturers would lose ten cents on each one made and sold <\s>
<s> thereupon they would cease to do a losing business capital would be withdrawn and spades would not be made until the supply was suited to the necessary expense of making them one dollar <\s>
<s> in this way whenever there is a departure of the value from the normal cost there is set in motion ipso facto a series of forces which automatically restores the value to that cost <\s>
<s> so here again we see the nature of an economic law the value may not often correspond exactly with cost of production but there is a tendency in all values to conform to that cost and this tendency they irresistibly obey <\s>
<s> a body possessing weight does not move downward under all circumstances stones may be thrown upward but the law of gravitation holds true nevertheless <\s>
<s> there is no need that there should be any actual alteration of supply and when there is the alteration if permanent is not the cause but the consequence of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> if indeed the supply could not be increased no diminution in the cost of production would lower the value but there is by no means any necessity that it should <\s>

<s> before the electric light was yet known as a feasible means of lighting in 1878 the mere rumor of edisons invention before it was made public and long before it became practicable caused a serious fall in the price of gas stocks <\s>

<s> what the production of a thing costs to its producer or its series of producers is the labor expended in producing it <\s>
<s> if we consider as the producer the capitalist who makes the advances the word labor may be replaced by the word wages what the produce costs to him is the wages which he has had to pay <\s>
<s> at the first glance indeed this seems to be only a part of his outlay since he has not only paid wages to laborers but has likewise provided them with tools materials and perhaps buildings <\s>
<s> these tools materials and buildings however were produced by labor and capital and their value like that of the article to the production of which they are subservient depends on cost of production which again is resolvable into labor <\s>
<s> the cost of production of broadcloth does not wholly consist in the wages of weavers which alone are directly paid by the cloth manufacturer <\s>
<s> it consists also of the wages of spinners and wool combers and it may be added of shepherds all of which the clothier has paid for in the price of yarn <\s>
<s> it consists too of the wages of builders and brick makers which he has reimbursed in the contract price of erecting his factory <\s>
<s> it partly consists of the wages of machine makers iron founders and miners <\s>
<s> and to these must be added the wages of the carriers who transported any of the means and appliances of the production to the place where they were to be used and the product itself to the place where it is to be sold <\s>
<s> confirmation is here given in the above words of the opinion that in mr <\s>
<s> mills mind cost of production was looked at wholly from the stand point of the capitalist and was identical with cost of labor to the capitalist <\s>
<s> the value of commodities therefore depends principally we shall presently see whether it depends solely on the quantity of labor required for their production including in the idea of production that of conveyance to the market <\s>
<s> but since the cost of production to the capitalist is not labor but wages and since wages may be either greater or less the quantity of labor being the same it would seem that the value of the product can not be determined solely by the quantity of labor but by the quantity together with the remuneration and that values must partly depend on wages <\s>
<s> now the relation of one thing to another can not be altered by any cause which affects them both alike <\s>
<s> a rise or fall of general wages is a fact which affects all commodities in the same manner and therefore affords no reason why they should exchange for each other in one rather than in another proportion <\s>
<s> though there is no such thing as a general rise of values there is such a thing as a general rise of prices <\s>
<s> as soon as we form distinctly the idea of values we see that high or low wages can have nothing to do with them but that high wages make high prices is a popular and widely spread opinion <\s>
<s> the whole amount of error involved in this proposition can only be seen thoroughly when we come to the theory of money at present we need only say that if it be true there can be no such thing as a real rise of wages for if wages could not rise without a proportional rise of the price of everything they could not for any substantial purpose rise at all <\s>
<s> it must be remembered too that general high prices even supposing them to exist can be of no use to a producer or dealer considered as such for if they increase his money returns they increase in the same degree all his expenses <\s>
<s> there is no mode in which capitalists can compensate themselves for a high cost of labor through any action on values or prices <\s>
<s> it can not be prevented from taking its effect in low profits <\s>
<s> if the laborers really get more that is get the produce of more labor a smaller percentage must remain for profit <\s>
<s> the monopolist can fix the value as high as he pleases short of what the consumer either could not or would not pay but he can only do so by limiting the supply <\s>
<s> monopoly value therefore does not depend on any peculiar principle but is a mere variety of the ordinary case of demand and supply <\s>
<s> again though there are few commodities which are at all times and forever unsusceptible of increase of supply any commodity whatever may be temporarily so and with some commodities this is habitually the case <\s>
<s> agricultural produce for example can not be increased in quantity before the next harvest the quantity of corn already existing in the world is all that can be had for sometimes a year to come <\s>
<s> during that interval corn is practically assimilated to things of which the quantity can not be increased <\s>
<s> in the case of most commodities it requires a certain time to increase their quantity and if the demand increases then until a corresponding supply can be brought forward that is until the supply can accommodate itself to the demand the value will so rise as to accommodate the demand to the supply <\s>
<s> there is another case the exact converse of this <\s>
<s> there are some articles of which the supply may be indefinitely increased but can not be rapidly diminished <\s>
<s> there are things so durable that the quantity in existence is at all times very great in comparison with the annual produce <\s>
<s> gold and the more durable metals are things of this sort and also houses <\s>
<s> the supply of such things might be at once diminished by destroying them but to do this could only be the interest of the possessor if he had a monopoly of the article and could repay himself for the destruction of a part by the increased value of the remainder <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such things may continue for a long time so low either from excess of supply or falling off in the demand as to put a complete stop to further production the diminution of supply by wearing out being so slow a process that a long time is requisite even under a total suspension of production to restore the original value <\s>
<s> during that interval the value will be regulated solely by supply and demand and will rise very gradually as the existing stock wears out until there is again a remunerating value and production resumes its course <\s>
<s> the total value of gold and silver in the world is variously estimated at from 10,000 000,000 to 14,000 000,000 while the annual production of both gold and silver in the world during 1882 211 was only 212,000 000 <\s>
<s> the loss of gold by abrasion is about 1/1000 annually and of silver about 1/700 but much depends on the size of the coin <\s>
<s> a change in the annual production of the precious metals can have a perceptible effect on their value only after such a time as will permit the change to affect the existing quantity in a way somewhat comparable with its previous amount <\s>
<s> the quantity however of wheat produced is nearly all consumed between harvests and the annual supply bears a very large ratio to the existing quantity <\s>
<s> consequently the price of wheat will be very seriously affected by the quantity coming from the annual product <\s>
<s> finally there are commodities of which though capable of being increased or diminished to a great and even an unlimited extent the value never depends upon anything but demand and supply <\s>
<s> this is the case in particular with the commodity labor of the value of which we have treated copiously in the preceding book and there are many cases besides in which we shall find it necessary to call in this principle to solve difficult questions of exchange value <\s>

<s> commodities which are susceptible of indefinite multiplication without increase of cost <\s>
<s> law of their value cost of production <\s>
<s> when the production of a commodity is the effect of labor and expenditure whether the commodity is susceptible of unlimited multiplication or not there is a minimum value which is the essential condition of its being permanently produced <\s>
<s> the value at any particular time is the result of supply and demand and is always that which is necessary to create a market for the existing supply <\s>
<s> but unless that value is sufficient to repay the cost of production and to afford besides the ordinary expectation of profit the commodity will not continue to be produced <\s>
<s> capitalists will not go on permanently producing at a loss <\s>
<s> when such profit is evidently not to be had if people do not actually withdraw their capital they at least abstain from replacing it when consumed <\s>
<s> the cost of production together with the ordinary profit may therefore be called the necessary price or value of all things made by labor and capital <\s>
<s> nobody willingly produces in the prospect of loss <\s>
<s> when a commodity is not only made by labor and capital but can be made by them in indefinite quantity this necessary value the minimum with which the producers will be content is also if competition is free and active the maximum which they can expect <\s>
<s> if the value of a commodity is such that it repays the cost of production not only with the customary but with a higher rate of profit capital rushes to share in this extra gain and by increasing the supply of the article reduces its value <\s>
<s> this is not a mere supposition or surmise but a fact familiar to those conversant with commercial operations <\s>
<s> whenever a new line of business presents itself offering a hope of unusual profits and whenever any established trade or manufacture is believed to be yielding a greater profit than customary there is sure to be in a short time so large a production or importation of the commodity as not only destroys the extra profit but generally goes beyond the mark and sinks the value as much too low as it had before been raised too high until the over supply is corrected by a total or partial suspension of further production <\s>
<s> as already intimated 212 these variations in the quantity produced do not presuppose or require that any person should change his employment <\s>
<s> those whose business is thriving increase their produce by availing themselves more largely of their credit while those who are not making the ordinary profit restrict their operations and in manufacturing phrase work short time <\s>
<s> in this mode is surely and speedily effected the equalization not of profits perhaps but of the expectations of profit in different occupations <\s>
<s> as a general rule then things tend to exchange for one another at such values as will enable each producer to be repaid the cost of production with the ordinary profit in other words such as will give to all producers the same rate of profit on their outlay <\s>
<s> but in order that the profit may be equal where the outlay that is the cost of production is equal things must on the average exchange for one another in the ratio of their cost of production things of which the cost of production is the same must be of the same value <\s>
<s> mill has here used cost of production almost exactly in the sense of cost of labor and as excluding profit while in the next chapter he includes some part of profit in the analysis <\s>

<s> having thus pointed out what is mr <\s>
<s> mills conception of cost of production it will remain for us in the next chapter to consider whether any other view of it is more satisfactory <\s>
<s> adam smith and ricardo have called that value of a thing which is proportional to its cost of production its natural value or its natural price <\s>
<s> they meant by this the point about which the value oscillates and to which it always tends to return the center value toward which as adam smith expresses it the market value of a thing is constantly gravitating and any deviation from which is but a temporary irregularity which the moment it exists sets forces in motion tending to correct it <\s>
<s> on an average of years sufficient to enable the oscillations on one side of the central line to be compensated by those on the other the market value agrees with the natural value but it very seldom coincides exactly with it at any particular time <\s>
<s> the sea everywhere tends to a level but it never is at an exact level its surface is always ruffled by waves and often agitated by storms <\s>

<s> the value of these commodities confirm in the long run to their cost of production through the operation of demand and supply <\s>
<s> the latent influence by which the values of things are made to conform in the long run to the cost of production is the variation that would otherwise take place in the supply of the commodity <\s>
<s> the supply would be increased if the thing continued to sell above the ratio of its cost of production and would be diminished if it fell below that ratio <\s>
<s> if one dollar covers the expense of making one spade then when a spade by virtue of a sudden demand rises in value to one dollar and ten cents the manufacturers get an extra profit of ten cents <\s>
<s> this could not long remain so because other capital would enter this industry and so increase the supply that one spade would sell for only one dollar then all would receive the average profit <\s>
<s> if owing to a cessation of demand for spades the price fell to ninety cents then the manufacturers would lose ten cents on each one made and sold <\s>
<s> thereupon they would cease to do a losing business capital would be withdrawn and spades would not be made until the supply was suited to the necessary expense of making them one dollar <\s>
<s> in this way whenever there is a departure of the value from the normal cost there is set in motion ipso facto a series of forces which automatically restores the value to that cost <\s>
<s> so here again we see the nature of an economic law the value may not often correspond exactly with cost of production but there is a tendency in all values to conform to that cost and this tendency they irresistibly obey <\s>
<s> a body possessing weight does not move downward under all circumstances stones may be thrown upward but the law of gravitation holds true nevertheless <\s>
<s> there is no need that there should be any actual alteration of supply and when there is the alteration if permanent is not the cause but the consequence of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> if indeed the supply could not be increased no diminution in the cost of production would lower the value but there is by no means any necessity that it should <\s>

<s> before the electric light was yet known as a feasible means of lighting in 1878 the mere rumor of edisons invention before it was made public and long before it became practicable caused a serious fall in the price of gas stocks <\s>

<s> what the production of a thing costs to its producer or its series of producers is the labor expended in producing it <\s>
<s> if we consider as the producer the capitalist who makes the advances the word labor may be replaced by the word wages what the produce costs to him is the wages which he has had to pay <\s>
<s> at the first glance indeed this seems to be only a part of his outlay since he has not only paid wages to laborers but has likewise provided them with tools materials and perhaps buildings <\s>
<s> these tools materials and buildings however were produced by labor and capital and their value like that of the article to the production of which they are subservient depends on cost of production which again is resolvable into labor <\s>
<s> the cost of production of broadcloth does not wholly consist in the wages of weavers which alone are directly paid by the cloth manufacturer <\s>
<s> it consists also of the wages of spinners and wool combers and it may be added of shepherds all of which the clothier has paid for in the price of yarn <\s>
<s> it consists too of the wages of builders and brick makers which he has reimbursed in the contract price of erecting his factory <\s>
<s> it partly consists of the wages of machine makers iron founders and miners <\s>
<s> and to these must be added the wages of the carriers who transported any of the means and appliances of the production to the place where they were to be used and the product itself to the place where it is to be sold <\s>
<s> confirmation is here given in the above words of the opinion that in mr <\s>
<s> mills mind cost of production was looked at wholly from the stand point of the capitalist and was identical with cost of labor to the capitalist <\s>
<s> the value of commodities therefore depends principally we shall presently see whether it depends solely on the quantity of labor required for their production including in the idea of production that of conveyance to the market <\s>
<s> but since the cost of production to the capitalist is not labor but wages and since wages may be either greater or less the quantity of labor being the same it would seem that the value of the product can not be determined solely by the quantity of labor but by the quantity together with the remuneration and that values must partly depend on wages <\s>
<s> now the relation of one thing to another can not be altered by any cause which affects them both alike <\s>
<s> a rise or fall of general wages is a fact which affects all commodities in the same manner and therefore affords no reason why they should exchange for each other in one rather than in another proportion <\s>
<s> though there is no such thing as a general rise of values there is such a thing as a general rise of prices <\s>
<s> as soon as we form distinctly the idea of values we see that high or low wages can have nothing to do with them but that high wages make high prices is a popular and widely spread opinion <\s>
<s> the whole amount of error involved in this proposition can only be seen thoroughly when we come to the theory of money at present we need only say that if it be true there can be no such thing as a real rise of wages for if wages could not rise without a proportional rise of the price of everything they could not for any substantial purpose rise at all <\s>
<s> it must be remembered too that general high prices even supposing them to exist can be of no use to a producer or dealer considered as such for if they increase his money returns they increase in the same degree all his expenses <\s>
<s> there is no mode in which capitalists can compensate themselves for a high cost of labor through any action on values or prices <\s>
<s> it can not be prevented from taking its effect in low profits <\s>
<s> if the laborers really get more that is get the produce of more labor a smaller percentage must remain for profit <\s>
<s> the monopolist can fix the value as high as he pleases short of what the consumer either could not or would not pay but he can only do so by limiting the supply <\s>
<s> monopoly value therefore does not depend on any peculiar principle but is a mere variety of the ordinary case of demand and supply <\s>
<s> again though there are few commodities which are at all times and forever unsusceptible of increase of supply any commodity whatever may be temporarily so and with some commodities this is habitually the case <\s>
<s> agricultural produce for example can not be increased in quantity before the next harvest the quantity of corn already existing in the world is all that can be had for sometimes a year to come <\s>
<s> during that interval corn is practically assimilated to things of which the quantity can not be increased <\s>
<s> in the case of most commodities it requires a certain time to increase their quantity and if the demand increases then until a corresponding supply can be brought forward that is until the supply can accommodate itself to the demand the value will so rise as to accommodate the demand to the supply <\s>
<s> there is another case the exact converse of this <\s>
<s> there are some articles of which the supply may be indefinitely increased but can not be rapidly diminished <\s>
<s> there are things so durable that the quantity in existence is at all times very great in comparison with the annual produce <\s>
<s> gold and the more durable metals are things of this sort and also houses <\s>
<s> the supply of such things might be at once diminished by destroying them but to do this could only be the interest of the possessor if he had a monopoly of the article and could repay himself for the destruction of a part by the increased value of the remainder <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such things may continue for a long time so low either from excess of supply or falling off in the demand as to put a complete stop to further production the diminution of supply by wearing out being so slow a process that a long time is requisite even under a total suspension of production to restore the original value <\s>
<s> during that interval the value will be regulated solely by supply and demand and will rise very gradually as the existing stock wears out until there is again a remunerating value and production resumes its course <\s>
<s> the total value of gold and silver in the world is variously estimated at from 10,000 000,000 to 14,000 000,000 while the annual production of both gold and silver in the world during 1882 211 was only 212,000 000 <\s>
<s> the loss of gold by abrasion is about 1/1000 annually and of silver about 1/700 but much depends on the size of the coin <\s>
<s> a change in the annual production of the precious metals can have a perceptible effect on their value only after such a time as will permit the change to affect the existing quantity in a way somewhat comparable with its previous amount <\s>
<s> the quantity however of wheat produced is nearly all consumed between harvests and the annual supply bears a very large ratio to the existing quantity <\s>
<s> consequently the price of wheat will be very seriously affected by the quantity coming from the annual product <\s>
<s> finally there are commodities of which though capable of being increased or diminished to a great and even an unlimited extent the value never depends upon anything but demand and supply <\s>
<s> this is the case in particular with the commodity labor of the value of which we have treated copiously in the preceding book and there are many cases besides in which we shall find it necessary to call in this principle to solve difficult questions of exchange value <\s>

<s> commodities which are susceptible of indefinite multiplication without increase of cost <\s>
<s> law of their value cost of production <\s>
<s> when the production of a commodity is the effect of labor and expenditure whether the commodity is susceptible of unlimited multiplication or not there is a minimum value which is the essential condition of its being permanently produced <\s>
<s> the value at any particular time is the result of supply and demand and is always that which is necessary to create a market for the existing supply <\s>
<s> but unless that value is sufficient to repay the cost of production and to afford besides the ordinary expectation of profit the commodity will not continue to be produced <\s>
<s> capitalists will not go on permanently producing at a loss <\s>
<s> when such profit is evidently not to be had if people do not actually withdraw their capital they at least abstain from replacing it when consumed <\s>
<s> the cost of production together with the ordinary profit may therefore be called the necessary price or value of all things made by labor and capital <\s>
<s> nobody willingly produces in the prospect of loss <\s>
<s> when a commodity is not only made by labor and capital but can be made by them in indefinite quantity this necessary value the minimum with which the producers will be content is also if competition is free and active the maximum which they can expect <\s>
<s> if the value of a commodity is such that it repays the cost of production not only with the customary but with a higher rate of profit capital rushes to share in this extra gain and by increasing the supply of the article reduces its value <\s>
<s> this is not a mere supposition or surmise but a fact familiar to those conversant with commercial operations <\s>
<s> whenever a new line of business presents itself offering a hope of unusual profits and whenever any established trade or manufacture is believed to be yielding a greater profit than customary there is sure to be in a short time so large a production or importation of the commodity as not only destroys the extra profit but generally goes beyond the mark and sinks the value as much too low as it had before been raised too high until the over supply is corrected by a total or partial suspension of further production <\s>
<s> as already intimated 212 these variations in the quantity produced do not presuppose or require that any person should change his employment <\s>
<s> those whose business is thriving increase their produce by availing themselves more largely of their credit while those who are not making the ordinary profit restrict their operations and in manufacturing phrase work short time <\s>
<s> in this mode is surely and speedily effected the equalization not of profits perhaps but of the expectations of profit in different occupations <\s>
<s> as a general rule then things tend to exchange for one another at such values as will enable each producer to be repaid the cost of production with the ordinary profit in other words such as will give to all producers the same rate of profit on their outlay <\s>
<s> but in order that the profit may be equal where the outlay that is the cost of production is equal things must on the average exchange for one another in the ratio of their cost of production things of which the cost of production is the same must be of the same value <\s>
<s> mill has here used cost of production almost exactly in the sense of cost of labor and as excluding profit while in the next chapter he includes some part of profit in the analysis <\s>

<s> having thus pointed out what is mr <\s>
<s> mills conception of cost of production it will remain for us in the next chapter to consider whether any other view of it is more satisfactory <\s>
<s> adam smith and ricardo have called that value of a thing which is proportional to its cost of production its natural value or its natural price <\s>
<s> they meant by this the point about which the value oscillates and to which it always tends to return the center value toward which as adam smith expresses it the market value of a thing is constantly gravitating and any deviation from which is but a temporary irregularity which the moment it exists sets forces in motion tending to correct it <\s>
<s> on an average of years sufficient to enable the oscillations on one side of the central line to be compensated by those on the other the market value agrees with the natural value but it very seldom coincides exactly with it at any particular time <\s>
<s> the sea everywhere tends to a level but it never is at an exact level its surface is always ruffled by waves and often agitated by storms <\s>

<s> the value of these commodities confirm in the long run to their cost of production through the operation of demand and supply <\s>
<s> the latent influence by which the values of things are made to conform in the long run to the cost of production is the variation that would otherwise take place in the supply of the commodity <\s>
<s> the supply would be increased if the thing continued to sell above the ratio of its cost of production and would be diminished if it fell below that ratio <\s>
<s> if one dollar covers the expense of making one spade then when a spade by virtue of a sudden demand rises in value to one dollar and ten cents the manufacturers get an extra profit of ten cents <\s>
<s> this could not long remain so because other capital would enter this industry and so increase the supply that one spade would sell for only one dollar then all would receive the average profit <\s>
<s> if owing to a cessation of demand for spades the price fell to ninety cents then the manufacturers would lose ten cents on each one made and sold <\s>
<s> thereupon they would cease to do a losing business capital would be withdrawn and spades would not be made until the supply was suited to the necessary expense of making them one dollar <\s>
<s> in this way whenever there is a departure of the value from the normal cost there is set in motion ipso facto a series of forces which automatically restores the value to that cost <\s>
<s> so here again we see the nature of an economic law the value may not often correspond exactly with cost of production but there is a tendency in all values to conform to that cost and this tendency they irresistibly obey <\s>
<s> a body possessing weight does not move downward under all circumstances stones may be thrown upward but the law of gravitation holds true nevertheless <\s>
<s> there is no need that there should be any actual alteration of supply and when there is the alteration if permanent is not the cause but the consequence of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> if indeed the supply could not be increased no diminution in the cost of production would lower the value but there is by no means any necessity that it should <\s>

<s> before the electric light was yet known as a feasible means of lighting in 1878 the mere rumor of edisons invention before it was made public and long before it became practicable caused a serious fall in the price of gas stocks <\s>

<s> what the production of a thing costs to its producer or its series of producers is the labor expended in producing it <\s>
<s> if we consider as the producer the capitalist who makes the advances the word labor may be replaced by the word wages what the produce costs to him is the wages which he has had to pay <\s>
<s> at the first glance indeed this seems to be only a part of his outlay since he has not only paid wages to laborers but has likewise provided them with tools materials and perhaps buildings <\s>
<s> these tools materials and buildings however were produced by labor and capital and their value like that of the article to the production of which they are subservient depends on cost of production which again is resolvable into labor <\s>
<s> the cost of production of broadcloth does not wholly consist in the wages of weavers which alone are directly paid by the cloth manufacturer <\s>
<s> it consists also of the wages of spinners and wool combers and it may be added of shepherds all of which the clothier has paid for in the price of yarn <\s>
<s> it consists too of the wages of builders and brick makers which he has reimbursed in the contract price of erecting his factory <\s>
<s> it partly consists of the wages of machine makers iron founders and miners <\s>
<s> and to these must be added the wages of the carriers who transported any of the means and appliances of the production to the place where they were to be used and the product itself to the place where it is to be sold <\s>
<s> confirmation is here given in the above words of the opinion that in mr <\s>
<s> mills mind cost of production was looked at wholly from the stand point of the capitalist and was identical with cost of labor to the capitalist <\s>
<s> the value of commodities therefore depends principally we shall presently see whether it depends solely on the quantity of labor required for their production including in the idea of production that of conveyance to the market <\s>
<s> but since the cost of production to the capitalist is not labor but wages and since wages may be either greater or less the quantity of labor being the same it would seem that the value of the product can not be determined solely by the quantity of labor but by the quantity together with the remuneration and that values must partly depend on wages <\s>
<s> now the relation of one thing to another can not be altered by any cause which affects them both alike <\s>
<s> a rise or fall of general wages is a fact which affects all commodities in the same manner and therefore affords no reason why they should exchange for each other in one rather than in another proportion <\s>
<s> though there is no such thing as a general rise of values there is such a thing as a general rise of prices <\s>
<s> as soon as we form distinctly the idea of values we see that high or low wages can have nothing to do with them but that high wages make high prices is a popular and widely spread opinion <\s>
<s> the whole amount of error involved in this proposition can only be seen thoroughly when we come to the theory of money at present we need only say that if it be true there can be no such thing as a real rise of wages for if wages could not rise without a proportional rise of the price of everything they could not for any substantial purpose rise at all <\s>
<s> it must be remembered too that general high prices even supposing them to exist can be of no use to a producer or dealer considered as such for if they increase his money returns they increase in the same degree all his expenses <\s>
<s> there is no mode in which capitalists can compensate themselves for a high cost of labor through any action on values or prices <\s>
<s> it can not be prevented from taking its effect in low profits <\s>
<s> if the laborers really get more that is get the produce of more labor a smaller percentage must remain for profit <\s>
<s> the monopolist can fix the value as high as he pleases short of what the consumer either could not or would not pay but he can only do so by limiting the supply <\s>
<s> monopoly value therefore does not depend on any peculiar principle but is a mere variety of the ordinary case of demand and supply <\s>
<s> again though there are few commodities which are at all times and forever unsusceptible of increase of supply any commodity whatever may be temporarily so and with some commodities this is habitually the case <\s>
<s> agricultural produce for example can not be increased in quantity before the next harvest the quantity of corn already existing in the world is all that can be had for sometimes a year to come <\s>
<s> during that interval corn is practically assimilated to things of which the quantity can not be increased <\s>
<s> in the case of most commodities it requires a certain time to increase their quantity and if the demand increases then until a corresponding supply can be brought forward that is until the supply can accommodate itself to the demand the value will so rise as to accommodate the demand to the supply <\s>
<s> there is another case the exact converse of this <\s>
<s> there are some articles of which the supply may be indefinitely increased but can not be rapidly diminished <\s>
<s> there are things so durable that the quantity in existence is at all times very great in comparison with the annual produce <\s>
<s> gold and the more durable metals are things of this sort and also houses <\s>
<s> the supply of such things might be at once diminished by destroying them but to do this could only be the interest of the possessor if he had a monopoly of the article and could repay himself for the destruction of a part by the increased value of the remainder <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such things may continue for a long time so low either from excess of supply or falling off in the demand as to put a complete stop to further production the diminution of supply by wearing out being so slow a process that a long time is requisite even under a total suspension of production to restore the original value <\s>
<s> during that interval the value will be regulated solely by supply and demand and will rise very gradually as the existing stock wears out until there is again a remunerating value and production resumes its course <\s>
<s> the total value of gold and silver in the world is variously estimated at from 10,000 000,000 to 14,000 000,000 while the annual production of both gold and silver in the world during 1882 211 was only 212,000 000 <\s>
<s> the loss of gold by abrasion is about 1/1000 annually and of silver about 1/700 but much depends on the size of the coin <\s>
<s> a change in the annual production of the precious metals can have a perceptible effect on their value only after such a time as will permit the change to affect the existing quantity in a way somewhat comparable with its previous amount <\s>
<s> the quantity however of wheat produced is nearly all consumed between harvests and the annual supply bears a very large ratio to the existing quantity <\s>
<s> consequently the price of wheat will be very seriously affected by the quantity coming from the annual product <\s>
<s> finally there are commodities of which though capable of being increased or diminished to a great and even an unlimited extent the value never depends upon anything but demand and supply <\s>
<s> this is the case in particular with the commodity labor of the value of which we have treated copiously in the preceding book and there are many cases besides in which we shall find it necessary to call in this principle to solve difficult questions of exchange value <\s>

<s> commodities which are susceptible of indefinite multiplication without increase of cost <\s>
<s> law of their value cost of production <\s>
<s> when the production of a commodity is the effect of labor and expenditure whether the commodity is susceptible of unlimited multiplication or not there is a minimum value which is the essential condition of its being permanently produced <\s>
<s> the value at any particular time is the result of supply and demand and is always that which is necessary to create a market for the existing supply <\s>
<s> but unless that value is sufficient to repay the cost of production and to afford besides the ordinary expectation of profit the commodity will not continue to be produced <\s>
<s> capitalists will not go on permanently producing at a loss <\s>
<s> when such profit is evidently not to be had if people do not actually withdraw their capital they at least abstain from replacing it when consumed <\s>
<s> the cost of production together with the ordinary profit may therefore be called the necessary price or value of all things made by labor and capital <\s>
<s> nobody willingly produces in the prospect of loss <\s>
<s> when a commodity is not only made by labor and capital but can be made by them in indefinite quantity this necessary value the minimum with which the producers will be content is also if competition is free and active the maximum which they can expect <\s>
<s> if the value of a commodity is such that it repays the cost of production not only with the customary but with a higher rate of profit capital rushes to share in this extra gain and by increasing the supply of the article reduces its value <\s>
<s> this is not a mere supposition or surmise but a fact familiar to those conversant with commercial operations <\s>
<s> whenever a new line of business presents itself offering a hope of unusual profits and whenever any established trade or manufacture is believed to be yielding a greater profit than customary there is sure to be in a short time so large a production or importation of the commodity as not only destroys the extra profit but generally goes beyond the mark and sinks the value as much too low as it had before been raised too high until the over supply is corrected by a total or partial suspension of further production <\s>
<s> as already intimated 212 these variations in the quantity produced do not presuppose or require that any person should change his employment <\s>
<s> those whose business is thriving increase their produce by availing themselves more largely of their credit while those who are not making the ordinary profit restrict their operations and in manufacturing phrase work short time <\s>
<s> in this mode is surely and speedily effected the equalization not of profits perhaps but of the expectations of profit in different occupations <\s>
<s> as a general rule then things tend to exchange for one another at such values as will enable each producer to be repaid the cost of production with the ordinary profit in other words such as will give to all producers the same rate of profit on their outlay <\s>
<s> but in order that the profit may be equal where the outlay that is the cost of production is equal things must on the average exchange for one another in the ratio of their cost of production things of which the cost of production is the same must be of the same value <\s>
<s> mill has here used cost of production almost exactly in the sense of cost of labor and as excluding profit while in the next chapter he includes some part of profit in the analysis <\s>

<s> having thus pointed out what is mr <\s>
<s> mills conception of cost of production it will remain for us in the next chapter to consider whether any other view of it is more satisfactory <\s>
<s> adam smith and ricardo have called that value of a thing which is proportional to its cost of production its natural value or its natural price <\s>
<s> they meant by this the point about which the value oscillates and to which it always tends to return the center value toward which as adam smith expresses it the market value of a thing is constantly gravitating and any deviation from which is but a temporary irregularity which the moment it exists sets forces in motion tending to correct it <\s>
<s> on an average of years sufficient to enable the oscillations on one side of the central line to be compensated by those on the other the market value agrees with the natural value but it very seldom coincides exactly with it at any particular time <\s>
<s> the sea everywhere tends to a level but it never is at an exact level its surface is always ruffled by waves and often agitated by storms <\s>

<s> the value of these commodities confirm in the long run to their cost of production through the operation of demand and supply <\s>
<s> the latent influence by which the values of things are made to conform in the long run to the cost of production is the variation that would otherwise take place in the supply of the commodity <\s>
<s> the supply would be increased if the thing continued to sell above the ratio of its cost of production and would be diminished if it fell below that ratio <\s>
<s> if one dollar covers the expense of making one spade then when a spade by virtue of a sudden demand rises in value to one dollar and ten cents the manufacturers get an extra profit of ten cents <\s>
<s> this could not long remain so because other capital would enter this industry and so increase the supply that one spade would sell for only one dollar then all would receive the average profit <\s>
<s> if owing to a cessation of demand for spades the price fell to ninety cents then the manufacturers would lose ten cents on each one made and sold <\s>
<s> thereupon they would cease to do a losing business capital would be withdrawn and spades would not be made until the supply was suited to the necessary expense of making them one dollar <\s>
<s> in this way whenever there is a departure of the value from the normal cost there is set in motion ipso facto a series of forces which automatically restores the value to that cost <\s>
<s> so here again we see the nature of an economic law the value may not often correspond exactly with cost of production but there is a tendency in all values to conform to that cost and this tendency they irresistibly obey <\s>
<s> a body possessing weight does not move downward under all circumstances stones may be thrown upward but the law of gravitation holds true nevertheless <\s>
<s> there is no need that there should be any actual alteration of supply and when there is the alteration if permanent is not the cause but the consequence of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> if indeed the supply could not be increased no diminution in the cost of production would lower the value but there is by no means any necessity that it should <\s>

<s> before the electric light was yet known as a feasible means of lighting in 1878 the mere rumor of edisons invention before it was made public and long before it became practicable caused a serious fall in the price of gas stocks <\s>

<s> what the production of a thing costs to its producer or its series of producers is the labor expended in producing it <\s>
<s> if we consider as the producer the capitalist who makes the advances the word labor may be replaced by the word wages what the produce costs to him is the wages which he has had to pay <\s>
<s> at the first glance indeed this seems to be only a part of his outlay since he has not only paid wages to laborers but has likewise provided them with tools materials and perhaps buildings <\s>
<s> these tools materials and buildings however were produced by labor and capital and their value like that of the article to the production of which they are subservient depends on cost of production which again is resolvable into labor <\s>
<s> the cost of production of broadcloth does not wholly consist in the wages of weavers which alone are directly paid by the cloth manufacturer <\s>
<s> it consists also of the wages of spinners and wool combers and it may be added of shepherds all of which the clothier has paid for in the price of yarn <\s>
<s> it consists too of the wages of builders and brick makers which he has reimbursed in the contract price of erecting his factory <\s>
<s> it partly consists of the wages of machine makers iron founders and miners <\s>
<s> and to these must be added the wages of the carriers who transported any of the means and appliances of the production to the place where they were to be used and the product itself to the place where it is to be sold <\s>
<s> confirmation is here given in the above words of the opinion that in mr <\s>
<s> mills mind cost of production was looked at wholly from the stand point of the capitalist and was identical with cost of labor to the capitalist <\s>
<s> the value of commodities therefore depends principally we shall presently see whether it depends solely on the quantity of labor required for their production including in the idea of production that of conveyance to the market <\s>
<s> but since the cost of production to the capitalist is not labor but wages and since wages may be either greater or less the quantity of labor being the same it would seem that the value of the product can not be determined solely by the quantity of labor but by the quantity together with the remuneration and that values must partly depend on wages <\s>
<s> now the relation of one thing to another can not be altered by any cause which affects them both alike <\s>
<s> a rise or fall of general wages is a fact which affects all commodities in the same manner and therefore affords no reason why they should exchange for each other in one rather than in another proportion <\s>
<s> though there is no such thing as a general rise of values there is such a thing as a general rise of prices <\s>
<s> as soon as we form distinctly the idea of values we see that high or low wages can have nothing to do with them but that high wages make high prices is a popular and widely spread opinion <\s>
<s> the whole amount of error involved in this proposition can only be seen thoroughly when we come to the theory of money at present we need only say that if it be true there can be no such thing as a real rise of wages for if wages could not rise without a proportional rise of the price of everything they could not for any substantial purpose rise at all <\s>
<s> it must be remembered too that general high prices even supposing them to exist can be of no use to a producer or dealer considered as such for if they increase his money returns they increase in the same degree all his expenses <\s>
<s> there is no mode in which capitalists can compensate themselves for a high cost of labor through any action on values or prices <\s>
<s> it can not be prevented from taking its effect in low profits <\s>
<s> if the laborers really get more that is get the produce of more labor a smaller percentage must remain for profit <\s>
<s> the monopolist can fix the value as high as he pleases short of what the consumer either could not or would not pay but he can only do so by limiting the supply <\s>
<s> monopoly value therefore does not depend on any peculiar principle but is a mere variety of the ordinary case of demand and supply <\s>
<s> again though there are few commodities which are at all times and forever unsusceptible of increase of supply any commodity whatever may be temporarily so and with some commodities this is habitually the case <\s>
<s> agricultural produce for example can not be increased in quantity before the next harvest the quantity of corn already existing in the world is all that can be had for sometimes a year to come <\s>
<s> during that interval corn is practically assimilated to things of which the quantity can not be increased <\s>
<s> in the case of most commodities it requires a certain time to increase their quantity and if the demand increases then until a corresponding supply can be brought forward that is until the supply can accommodate itself to the demand the value will so rise as to accommodate the demand to the supply <\s>
<s> there is another case the exact converse of this <\s>
<s> there are some articles of which the supply may be indefinitely increased but can not be rapidly diminished <\s>
<s> there are things so durable that the quantity in existence is at all times very great in comparison with the annual produce <\s>
<s> gold and the more durable metals are things of this sort and also houses <\s>
<s> the supply of such things might be at once diminished by destroying them but to do this could only be the interest of the possessor if he had a monopoly of the article and could repay himself for the destruction of a part by the increased value of the remainder <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such things may continue for a long time so low either from excess of supply or falling off in the demand as to put a complete stop to further production the diminution of supply by wearing out being so slow a process that a long time is requisite even under a total suspension of production to restore the original value <\s>
<s> during that interval the value will be regulated solely by supply and demand and will rise very gradually as the existing stock wears out until there is again a remunerating value and production resumes its course <\s>
<s> the total value of gold and silver in the world is variously estimated at from 10,000 000,000 to 14,000 000,000 while the annual production of both gold and silver in the world during 1882 211 was only 212,000 000 <\s>
<s> the loss of gold by abrasion is about 1/1000 annually and of silver about 1/700 but much depends on the size of the coin <\s>
<s> a change in the annual production of the precious metals can have a perceptible effect on their value only after such a time as will permit the change to affect the existing quantity in a way somewhat comparable with its previous amount <\s>
<s> the quantity however of wheat produced is nearly all consumed between harvests and the annual supply bears a very large ratio to the existing quantity <\s>
<s> consequently the price of wheat will be very seriously affected by the quantity coming from the annual product <\s>
<s> finally there are commodities of which though capable of being increased or diminished to a great and even an unlimited extent the value never depends upon anything but demand and supply <\s>
<s> this is the case in particular with the commodity labor of the value of which we have treated copiously in the preceding book and there are many cases besides in which we shall find it necessary to call in this principle to solve difficult questions of exchange value <\s>

<s> commodities which are susceptible of indefinite multiplication without increase of cost <\s>
<s> law of their value cost of production <\s>
<s> when the production of a commodity is the effect of labor and expenditure whether the commodity is susceptible of unlimited multiplication or not there is a minimum value which is the essential condition of its being permanently produced <\s>
<s> the value at any particular time is the result of supply and demand and is always that which is necessary to create a market for the existing supply <\s>
<s> but unless that value is sufficient to repay the cost of production and to afford besides the ordinary expectation of profit the commodity will not continue to be produced <\s>
<s> capitalists will not go on permanently producing at a loss <\s>
<s> when such profit is evidently not to be had if people do not actually withdraw their capital they at least abstain from replacing it when consumed <\s>
<s> the cost of production together with the ordinary profit may therefore be called the necessary price or value of all things made by labor and capital <\s>
<s> nobody willingly produces in the prospect of loss <\s>
<s> when a commodity is not only made by labor and capital but can be made by them in indefinite quantity this necessary value the minimum with which the producers will be content is also if competition is free and active the maximum which they can expect <\s>
<s> if the value of a commodity is such that it repays the cost of production not only with the customary but with a higher rate of profit capital rushes to share in this extra gain and by increasing the supply of the article reduces its value <\s>
<s> this is not a mere supposition or surmise but a fact familiar to those conversant with commercial operations <\s>
<s> whenever a new line of business presents itself offering a hope of unusual profits and whenever any established trade or manufacture is believed to be yielding a greater profit than customary there is sure to be in a short time so large a production or importation of the commodity as not only destroys the extra profit but generally goes beyond the mark and sinks the value as much too low as it had before been raised too high until the over supply is corrected by a total or partial suspension of further production <\s>
<s> as already intimated 212 these variations in the quantity produced do not presuppose or require that any person should change his employment <\s>
<s> those whose business is thriving increase their produce by availing themselves more largely of their credit while those who are not making the ordinary profit restrict their operations and in manufacturing phrase work short time <\s>
<s> in this mode is surely and speedily effected the equalization not of profits perhaps but of the expectations of profit in different occupations <\s>
<s> as a general rule then things tend to exchange for one another at such values as will enable each producer to be repaid the cost of production with the ordinary profit in other words such as will give to all producers the same rate of profit on their outlay <\s>
<s> but in order that the profit may be equal where the outlay that is the cost of production is equal things must on the average exchange for one another in the ratio of their cost of production things of which the cost of production is the same must be of the same value <\s>
<s> mill has here used cost of production almost exactly in the sense of cost of labor and as excluding profit while in the next chapter he includes some part of profit in the analysis <\s>

<s> having thus pointed out what is mr <\s>
<s> mills conception of cost of production it will remain for us in the next chapter to consider whether any other view of it is more satisfactory <\s>
<s> adam smith and ricardo have called that value of a thing which is proportional to its cost of production its natural value or its natural price <\s>
<s> they meant by this the point about which the value oscillates and to which it always tends to return the center value toward which as adam smith expresses it the market value of a thing is constantly gravitating and any deviation from which is but a temporary irregularity which the moment it exists sets forces in motion tending to correct it <\s>
<s> on an average of years sufficient to enable the oscillations on one side of the central line to be compensated by those on the other the market value agrees with the natural value but it very seldom coincides exactly with it at any particular time <\s>
<s> the sea everywhere tends to a level but it never is at an exact level its surface is always ruffled by waves and often agitated by storms <\s>

<s> the value of these commodities confirm in the long run to their cost of production through the operation of demand and supply <\s>
<s> the latent influence by which the values of things are made to conform in the long run to the cost of production is the variation that would otherwise take place in the supply of the commodity <\s>
<s> the supply would be increased if the thing continued to sell above the ratio of its cost of production and would be diminished if it fell below that ratio <\s>
<s> if one dollar covers the expense of making one spade then when a spade by virtue of a sudden demand rises in value to one dollar and ten cents the manufacturers get an extra profit of ten cents <\s>
<s> this could not long remain so because other capital would enter this industry and so increase the supply that one spade would sell for only one dollar then all would receive the average profit <\s>
<s> if owing to a cessation of demand for spades the price fell to ninety cents then the manufacturers would lose ten cents on each one made and sold <\s>
<s> thereupon they would cease to do a losing business capital would be withdrawn and spades would not be made until the supply was suited to the necessary expense of making them one dollar <\s>
<s> in this way whenever there is a departure of the value from the normal cost there is set in motion ipso facto a series of forces which automatically restores the value to that cost <\s>
<s> so here again we see the nature of an economic law the value may not often correspond exactly with cost of production but there is a tendency in all values to conform to that cost and this tendency they irresistibly obey <\s>
<s> a body possessing weight does not move downward under all circumstances stones may be thrown upward but the law of gravitation holds true nevertheless <\s>
<s> there is no need that there should be any actual alteration of supply and when there is the alteration if permanent is not the cause but the consequence of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> if indeed the supply could not be increased no diminution in the cost of production would lower the value but there is by no means any necessity that it should <\s>

<s> before the electric light was yet known as a feasible means of lighting in 1878 the mere rumor of edisons invention before it was made public and long before it became practicable caused a serious fall in the price of gas stocks <\s>

<s> what the production of a thing costs to its producer or its series of producers is the labor expended in producing it <\s>
<s> if we consider as the producer the capitalist who makes the advances the word labor may be replaced by the word wages what the produce costs to him is the wages which he has had to pay <\s>
<s> at the first glance indeed this seems to be only a part of his outlay since he has not only paid wages to laborers but has likewise provided them with tools materials and perhaps buildings <\s>
<s> these tools materials and buildings however were produced by labor and capital and their value like that of the article to the production of which they are subservient depends on cost of production which again is resolvable into labor <\s>
<s> the cost of production of broadcloth does not wholly consist in the wages of weavers which alone are directly paid by the cloth manufacturer <\s>
<s> it consists also of the wages of spinners and wool combers and it may be added of shepherds all of which the clothier has paid for in the price of yarn <\s>
<s> it consists too of the wages of builders and brick makers which he has reimbursed in the contract price of erecting his factory <\s>
<s> it partly consists of the wages of machine makers iron founders and miners <\s>
<s> and to these must be added the wages of the carriers who transported any of the means and appliances of the production to the place where they were to be used and the product itself to the place where it is to be sold <\s>
<s> confirmation is here given in the above words of the opinion that in mr <\s>
<s> mills mind cost of production was looked at wholly from the stand point of the capitalist and was identical with cost of labor to the capitalist <\s>
<s> the value of commodities therefore depends principally we shall presently see whether it depends solely on the quantity of labor required for their production including in the idea of production that of conveyance to the market <\s>
<s> but since the cost of production to the capitalist is not labor but wages and since wages may be either greater or less the quantity of labor being the same it would seem that the value of the product can not be determined solely by the quantity of labor but by the quantity together with the remuneration and that values must partly depend on wages <\s>
<s> now the relation of one thing to another can not be altered by any cause which affects them both alike <\s>
<s> a rise or fall of general wages is a fact which affects all commodities in the same manner and therefore affords no reason why they should exchange for each other in one rather than in another proportion <\s>
<s> though there is no such thing as a general rise of values there is such a thing as a general rise of prices <\s>
<s> as soon as we form distinctly the idea of values we see that high or low wages can have nothing to do with them but that high wages make high prices is a popular and widely spread opinion <\s>
<s> the whole amount of error involved in this proposition can only be seen thoroughly when we come to the theory of money at present we need only say that if it be true there can be no such thing as a real rise of wages for if wages could not rise without a proportional rise of the price of everything they could not for any substantial purpose rise at all <\s>
<s> it must be remembered too that general high prices even supposing them to exist can be of no use to a producer or dealer considered as such for if they increase his money returns they increase in the same degree all his expenses <\s>
<s> there is no mode in which capitalists can compensate themselves for a high cost of labor through any action on values or prices <\s>
<s> it can not be prevented from taking its effect in low profits <\s>
<s> if the laborers really get more that is get the produce of more labor a smaller percentage must remain for profit <\s>
<s> the monopolist can fix the value as high as he pleases short of what the consumer either could not or would not pay but he can only do so by limiting the supply <\s>
<s> monopoly value therefore does not depend on any peculiar principle but is a mere variety of the ordinary case of demand and supply <\s>
<s> again though there are few commodities which are at all times and forever unsusceptible of increase of supply any commodity whatever may be temporarily so and with some commodities this is habitually the case <\s>
<s> agricultural produce for example can not be increased in quantity before the next harvest the quantity of corn already existing in the world is all that can be had for sometimes a year to come <\s>
<s> during that interval corn is practically assimilated to things of which the quantity can not be increased <\s>
<s> in the case of most commodities it requires a certain time to increase their quantity and if the demand increases then until a corresponding supply can be brought forward that is until the supply can accommodate itself to the demand the value will so rise as to accommodate the demand to the supply <\s>
<s> there is another case the exact converse of this <\s>
<s> there are some articles of which the supply may be indefinitely increased but can not be rapidly diminished <\s>
<s> there are things so durable that the quantity in existence is at all times very great in comparison with the annual produce <\s>
<s> gold and the more durable metals are things of this sort and also houses <\s>
<s> the supply of such things might be at once diminished by destroying them but to do this could only be the interest of the possessor if he had a monopoly of the article and could repay himself for the destruction of a part by the increased value of the remainder <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such things may continue for a long time so low either from excess of supply or falling off in the demand as to put a complete stop to further production the diminution of supply by wearing out being so slow a process that a long time is requisite even under a total suspension of production to restore the original value <\s>
<s> during that interval the value will be regulated solely by supply and demand and will rise very gradually as the existing stock wears out until there is again a remunerating value and production resumes its course <\s>
<s> the total value of gold and silver in the world is variously estimated at from 10,000 000,000 to 14,000 000,000 while the annual production of both gold and silver in the world during 1882 211 was only 212,000 000 <\s>
<s> the loss of gold by abrasion is about 1/1000 annually and of silver about 1/700 but much depends on the size of the coin <\s>
<s> a change in the annual production of the precious metals can have a perceptible effect on their value only after such a time as will permit the change to affect the existing quantity in a way somewhat comparable with its previous amount <\s>
<s> the quantity however of wheat produced is nearly all consumed between harvests and the annual supply bears a very large ratio to the existing quantity <\s>
<s> consequently the price of wheat will be very seriously affected by the quantity coming from the annual product <\s>
<s> finally there are commodities of which though capable of being increased or diminished to a great and even an unlimited extent the value never depends upon anything but demand and supply <\s>
<s> this is the case in particular with the commodity labor of the value of which we have treated copiously in the preceding book and there are many cases besides in which we shall find it necessary to call in this principle to solve difficult questions of exchange value <\s>

<s> commodities which are susceptible of indefinite multiplication without increase of cost <\s>
<s> law of their value cost of production <\s>
<s> when the production of a commodity is the effect of labor and expenditure whether the commodity is susceptible of unlimited multiplication or not there is a minimum value which is the essential condition of its being permanently produced <\s>
<s> the value at any particular time is the result of supply and demand and is always that which is necessary to create a market for the existing supply <\s>
<s> but unless that value is sufficient to repay the cost of production and to afford besides the ordinary expectation of profit the commodity will not continue to be produced <\s>
<s> capitalists will not go on permanently producing at a loss <\s>
<s> when such profit is evidently not to be had if people do not actually withdraw their capital they at least abstain from replacing it when consumed <\s>
<s> the cost of production together with the ordinary profit may therefore be called the necessary price or value of all things made by labor and capital <\s>
<s> nobody willingly produces in the prospect of loss <\s>
<s> when a commodity is not only made by labor and capital but can be made by them in indefinite quantity this necessary value the minimum with which the producers will be content is also if competition is free and active the maximum which they can expect <\s>
<s> if the value of a commodity is such that it repays the cost of production not only with the customary but with a higher rate of profit capital rushes to share in this extra gain and by increasing the supply of the article reduces its value <\s>
<s> this is not a mere supposition or surmise but a fact familiar to those conversant with commercial operations <\s>
<s> whenever a new line of business presents itself offering a hope of unusual profits and whenever any established trade or manufacture is believed to be yielding a greater profit than customary there is sure to be in a short time so large a production or importation of the commodity as not only destroys the extra profit but generally goes beyond the mark and sinks the value as much too low as it had before been raised too high until the over supply is corrected by a total or partial suspension of further production <\s>
<s> as already intimated 212 these variations in the quantity produced do not presuppose or require that any person should change his employment <\s>
<s> those whose business is thriving increase their produce by availing themselves more largely of their credit while those who are not making the ordinary profit restrict their operations and in manufacturing phrase work short time <\s>
<s> in this mode is surely and speedily effected the equalization not of profits perhaps but of the expectations of profit in different occupations <\s>
<s> as a general rule then things tend to exchange for one another at such values as will enable each producer to be repaid the cost of production with the ordinary profit in other words such as will give to all producers the same rate of profit on their outlay <\s>
<s> but in order that the profit may be equal where the outlay that is the cost of production is equal things must on the average exchange for one another in the ratio of their cost of production things of which the cost of production is the same must be of the same value <\s>
<s> mill has here used cost of production almost exactly in the sense of cost of labor and as excluding profit while in the next chapter he includes some part of profit in the analysis <\s>

<s> having thus pointed out what is mr <\s>
<s> mills conception of cost of production it will remain for us in the next chapter to consider whether any other view of it is more satisfactory <\s>
<s> adam smith and ricardo have called that value of a thing which is proportional to its cost of production its natural value or its natural price <\s>
<s> they meant by this the point about which the value oscillates and to which it always tends to return the center value toward which as adam smith expresses it the market value of a thing is constantly gravitating and any deviation from which is but a temporary irregularity which the moment it exists sets forces in motion tending to correct it <\s>
<s> on an average of years sufficient to enable the oscillations on one side of the central line to be compensated by those on the other the market value agrees with the natural value but it very seldom coincides exactly with it at any particular time <\s>
<s> the sea everywhere tends to a level but it never is at an exact level its surface is always ruffled by waves and often agitated by storms <\s>

<s> the value of these commodities confirm in the long run to their cost of production through the operation of demand and supply <\s>
<s> the latent influence by which the values of things are made to conform in the long run to the cost of production is the variation that would otherwise take place in the supply of the commodity <\s>
<s> the supply would be increased if the thing continued to sell above the ratio of its cost of production and would be diminished if it fell below that ratio <\s>
<s> if one dollar covers the expense of making one spade then when a spade by virtue of a sudden demand rises in value to one dollar and ten cents the manufacturers get an extra profit of ten cents <\s>
<s> this could not long remain so because other capital would enter this industry and so increase the supply that one spade would sell for only one dollar then all would receive the average profit <\s>
<s> if owing to a cessation of demand for spades the price fell to ninety cents then the manufacturers would lose ten cents on each one made and sold <\s>
<s> thereupon they would cease to do a losing business capital would be withdrawn and spades would not be made until the supply was suited to the necessary expense of making them one dollar <\s>
<s> in this way whenever there is a departure of the value from the normal cost there is set in motion ipso facto a series of forces which automatically restores the value to that cost <\s>
<s> so here again we see the nature of an economic law the value may not often correspond exactly with cost of production but there is a tendency in all values to conform to that cost and this tendency they irresistibly obey <\s>
<s> a body possessing weight does not move downward under all circumstances stones may be thrown upward but the law of gravitation holds true nevertheless <\s>
<s> there is no need that there should be any actual alteration of supply and when there is the alteration if permanent is not the cause but the consequence of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> if indeed the supply could not be increased no diminution in the cost of production would lower the value but there is by no means any necessity that it should <\s>

<s> before the electric light was yet known as a feasible means of lighting in 1878 the mere rumor of edisons invention before it was made public and long before it became practicable caused a serious fall in the price of gas stocks <\s>

<s> what the production of a thing costs to its producer or its series of producers is the labor expended in producing it <\s>
<s> if we consider as the producer the capitalist who makes the advances the word labor may be replaced by the word wages what the produce costs to him is the wages which he has had to pay <\s>
<s> at the first glance indeed this seems to be only a part of his outlay since he has not only paid wages to laborers but has likewise provided them with tools materials and perhaps buildings <\s>
<s> these tools materials and buildings however were produced by labor and capital and their value like that of the article to the production of which they are subservient depends on cost of production which again is resolvable into labor <\s>
<s> the cost of production of broadcloth does not wholly consist in the wages of weavers which alone are directly paid by the cloth manufacturer <\s>
<s> it consists also of the wages of spinners and wool combers and it may be added of shepherds all of which the clothier has paid for in the price of yarn <\s>
<s> it consists too of the wages of builders and brick makers which he has reimbursed in the contract price of erecting his factory <\s>
<s> it partly consists of the wages of machine makers iron founders and miners <\s>
<s> and to these must be added the wages of the carriers who transported any of the means and appliances of the production to the place where they were to be used and the product itself to the place where it is to be sold <\s>
<s> confirmation is here given in the above words of the opinion that in mr <\s>
<s> mills mind cost of production was looked at wholly from the stand point of the capitalist and was identical with cost of labor to the capitalist <\s>
<s> the value of commodities therefore depends principally we shall presently see whether it depends solely on the quantity of labor required for their production including in the idea of production that of conveyance to the market <\s>
<s> but since the cost of production to the capitalist is not labor but wages and since wages may be either greater or less the quantity of labor being the same it would seem that the value of the product can not be determined solely by the quantity of labor but by the quantity together with the remuneration and that values must partly depend on wages <\s>
<s> now the relation of one thing to another can not be altered by any cause which affects them both alike <\s>
<s> a rise or fall of general wages is a fact which affects all commodities in the same manner and therefore affords no reason why they should exchange for each other in one rather than in another proportion <\s>
<s> though there is no such thing as a general rise of values there is such a thing as a general rise of prices <\s>
<s> as soon as we form distinctly the idea of values we see that high or low wages can have nothing to do with them but that high wages make high prices is a popular and widely spread opinion <\s>
<s> the whole amount of error involved in this proposition can only be seen thoroughly when we come to the theory of money at present we need only say that if it be true there can be no such thing as a real rise of wages for if wages could not rise without a proportional rise of the price of everything they could not for any substantial purpose rise at all <\s>
<s> it must be remembered too that general high prices even supposing them to exist can be of no use to a producer or dealer considered as such for if they increase his money returns they increase in the same degree all his expenses <\s>
<s> there is no mode in which capitalists can compensate themselves for a high cost of labor through any action on values or prices <\s>
<s> it can not be prevented from taking its effect in low profits <\s>
<s> if the laborers really get more that is get the produce of more labor a smaller percentage must remain for profit <\s>
<s> the monopolist can fix the value as high as he pleases short of what the consumer either could not or would not pay but he can only do so by limiting the supply <\s>
<s> monopoly value therefore does not depend on any peculiar principle but is a mere variety of the ordinary case of demand and supply <\s>
<s> again though there are few commodities which are at all times and forever unsusceptible of increase of supply any commodity whatever may be temporarily so and with some commodities this is habitually the case <\s>
<s> agricultural produce for example can not be increased in quantity before the next harvest the quantity of corn already existing in the world is all that can be had for sometimes a year to come <\s>
<s> during that interval corn is practically assimilated to things of which the quantity can not be increased <\s>
<s> in the case of most commodities it requires a certain time to increase their quantity and if the demand increases then until a corresponding supply can be brought forward that is until the supply can accommodate itself to the demand the value will so rise as to accommodate the demand to the supply <\s>
<s> there is another case the exact converse of this <\s>
<s> there are some articles of which the supply may be indefinitely increased but can not be rapidly diminished <\s>
<s> there are things so durable that the quantity in existence is at all times very great in comparison with the annual produce <\s>
<s> gold and the more durable metals are things of this sort and also houses <\s>
<s> the supply of such things might be at once diminished by destroying them but to do this could only be the interest of the possessor if he had a monopoly of the article and could repay himself for the destruction of a part by the increased value of the remainder <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such things may continue for a long time so low either from excess of supply or falling off in the demand as to put a complete stop to further production the diminution of supply by wearing out being so slow a process that a long time is requisite even under a total suspension of production to restore the original value <\s>
<s> during that interval the value will be regulated solely by supply and demand and will rise very gradually as the existing stock wears out until there is again a remunerating value and production resumes its course <\s>
<s> the total value of gold and silver in the world is variously estimated at from 10,000 000,000 to 14,000 000,000 while the annual production of both gold and silver in the world during 1882 211 was only 212,000 000 <\s>
<s> the loss of gold by abrasion is about 1/1000 annually and of silver about 1/700 but much depends on the size of the coin <\s>
<s> a change in the annual production of the precious metals can have a perceptible effect on their value only after such a time as will permit the change to affect the existing quantity in a way somewhat comparable with its previous amount <\s>
<s> the quantity however of wheat produced is nearly all consumed between harvests and the annual supply bears a very large ratio to the existing quantity <\s>
<s> consequently the price of wheat will be very seriously affected by the quantity coming from the annual product <\s>
<s> finally there are commodities of which though capable of being increased or diminished to a great and even an unlimited extent the value never depends upon anything but demand and supply <\s>
<s> this is the case in particular with the commodity labor of the value of which we have treated copiously in the preceding book and there are many cases besides in which we shall find it necessary to call in this principle to solve difficult questions of exchange value <\s>

<s> commodities which are susceptible of indefinite multiplication without increase of cost <\s>
<s> law of their value cost of production <\s>
<s> when the production of a commodity is the effect of labor and expenditure whether the commodity is susceptible of unlimited multiplication or not there is a minimum value which is the essential condition of its being permanently produced <\s>
<s> the value at any particular time is the result of supply and demand and is always that which is necessary to create a market for the existing supply <\s>
<s> but unless that value is sufficient to repay the cost of production and to afford besides the ordinary expectation of profit the commodity will not continue to be produced <\s>
<s> capitalists will not go on permanently producing at a loss <\s>
<s> when such profit is evidently not to be had if people do not actually withdraw their capital they at least abstain from replacing it when consumed <\s>
<s> the cost of production together with the ordinary profit may therefore be called the necessary price or value of all things made by labor and capital <\s>
<s> nobody willingly produces in the prospect of loss <\s>
<s> when a commodity is not only made by labor and capital but can be made by them in indefinite quantity this necessary value the minimum with which the producers will be content is also if competition is free and active the maximum which they can expect <\s>
<s> if the value of a commodity is such that it repays the cost of production not only with the customary but with a higher rate of profit capital rushes to share in this extra gain and by increasing the supply of the article reduces its value <\s>
<s> this is not a mere supposition or surmise but a fact familiar to those conversant with commercial operations <\s>
<s> whenever a new line of business presents itself offering a hope of unusual profits and whenever any established trade or manufacture is believed to be yielding a greater profit than customary there is sure to be in a short time so large a production or importation of the commodity as not only destroys the extra profit but generally goes beyond the mark and sinks the value as much too low as it had before been raised too high until the over supply is corrected by a total or partial suspension of further production <\s>
<s> as already intimated 212 these variations in the quantity produced do not presuppose or require that any person should change his employment <\s>
<s> those whose business is thriving increase their produce by availing themselves more largely of their credit while those who are not making the ordinary profit restrict their operations and in manufacturing phrase work short time <\s>
<s> in this mode is surely and speedily effected the equalization not of profits perhaps but of the expectations of profit in different occupations <\s>
<s> as a general rule then things tend to exchange for one another at such values as will enable each producer to be repaid the cost of production with the ordinary profit in other words such as will give to all producers the same rate of profit on their outlay <\s>
<s> but in order that the profit may be equal where the outlay that is the cost of production is equal things must on the average exchange for one another in the ratio of their cost of production things of which the cost of production is the same must be of the same value <\s>
<s> mill has here used cost of production almost exactly in the sense of cost of labor and as excluding profit while in the next chapter he includes some part of profit in the analysis <\s>

<s> having thus pointed out what is mr <\s>
<s> mills conception of cost of production it will remain for us in the next chapter to consider whether any other view of it is more satisfactory <\s>
<s> adam smith and ricardo have called that value of a thing which is proportional to its cost of production its natural value or its natural price <\s>
<s> they meant by this the point about which the value oscillates and to which it always tends to return the center value toward which as adam smith expresses it the market value of a thing is constantly gravitating and any deviation from which is but a temporary irregularity which the moment it exists sets forces in motion tending to correct it <\s>
<s> on an average of years sufficient to enable the oscillations on one side of the central line to be compensated by those on the other the market value agrees with the natural value but it very seldom coincides exactly with it at any particular time <\s>
<s> the sea everywhere tends to a level but it never is at an exact level its surface is always ruffled by waves and often agitated by storms <\s>

<s> the value of these commodities confirm in the long run to their cost of production through the operation of demand and supply <\s>
<s> the latent influence by which the values of things are made to conform in the long run to the cost of production is the variation that would otherwise take place in the supply of the commodity <\s>
<s> the supply would be increased if the thing continued to sell above the ratio of its cost of production and would be diminished if it fell below that ratio <\s>
<s> if one dollar covers the expense of making one spade then when a spade by virtue of a sudden demand rises in value to one dollar and ten cents the manufacturers get an extra profit of ten cents <\s>
<s> this could not long remain so because other capital would enter this industry and so increase the supply that one spade would sell for only one dollar then all would receive the average profit <\s>
<s> if owing to a cessation of demand for spades the price fell to ninety cents then the manufacturers would lose ten cents on each one made and sold <\s>
<s> thereupon they would cease to do a losing business capital would be withdrawn and spades would not be made until the supply was suited to the necessary expense of making them one dollar <\s>
<s> in this way whenever there is a departure of the value from the normal cost there is set in motion ipso facto a series of forces which automatically restores the value to that cost <\s>
<s> so here again we see the nature of an economic law the value may not often correspond exactly with cost of production but there is a tendency in all values to conform to that cost and this tendency they irresistibly obey <\s>
<s> a body possessing weight does not move downward under all circumstances stones may be thrown upward but the law of gravitation holds true nevertheless <\s>
<s> there is no need that there should be any actual alteration of supply and when there is the alteration if permanent is not the cause but the consequence of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> if indeed the supply could not be increased no diminution in the cost of production would lower the value but there is by no means any necessity that it should <\s>

<s> before the electric light was yet known as a feasible means of lighting in 1878 the mere rumor of edisons invention before it was made public and long before it became practicable caused a serious fall in the price of gas stocks <\s>

<s> what the production of a thing costs to its producer or its series of producers is the labor expended in producing it <\s>
<s> if we consider as the producer the capitalist who makes the advances the word labor may be replaced by the word wages what the produce costs to him is the wages which he has had to pay <\s>
<s> at the first glance indeed this seems to be only a part of his outlay since he has not only paid wages to laborers but has likewise provided them with tools materials and perhaps buildings <\s>
<s> these tools materials and buildings however were produced by labor and capital and their value like that of the article to the production of which they are subservient depends on cost of production which again is resolvable into labor <\s>
<s> the cost of production of broadcloth does not wholly consist in the wages of weavers which alone are directly paid by the cloth manufacturer <\s>
<s> it consists also of the wages of spinners and wool combers and it may be added of shepherds all of which the clothier has paid for in the price of yarn <\s>
<s> it consists too of the wages of builders and brick makers which he has reimbursed in the contract price of erecting his factory <\s>
<s> it partly consists of the wages of machine makers iron founders and miners <\s>
<s> and to these must be added the wages of the carriers who transported any of the means and appliances of the production to the place where they were to be used and the product itself to the place where it is to be sold <\s>
<s> confirmation is here given in the above words of the opinion that in mr <\s>
<s> mills mind cost of production was looked at wholly from the stand point of the capitalist and was identical with cost of labor to the capitalist <\s>
<s> the value of commodities therefore depends principally we shall presently see whether it depends solely on the quantity of labor required for their production including in the idea of production that of conveyance to the market <\s>
<s> but since the cost of production to the capitalist is not labor but wages and since wages may be either greater or less the quantity of labor being the same it would seem that the value of the product can not be determined solely by the quantity of labor but by the quantity together with the remuneration and that values must partly depend on wages <\s>
<s> now the relation of one thing to another can not be altered by any cause which affects them both alike <\s>
<s> a rise or fall of general wages is a fact which affects all commodities in the same manner and therefore affords no reason why they should exchange for each other in one rather than in another proportion <\s>
<s> though there is no such thing as a general rise of values there is such a thing as a general rise of prices <\s>
<s> as soon as we form distinctly the idea of values we see that high or low wages can have nothing to do with them but that high wages make high prices is a popular and widely spread opinion <\s>
<s> the whole amount of error involved in this proposition can only be seen thoroughly when we come to the theory of money at present we need only say that if it be true there can be no such thing as a real rise of wages for if wages could not rise without a proportional rise of the price of everything they could not for any substantial purpose rise at all <\s>
<s> it must be remembered too that general high prices even supposing them to exist can be of no use to a producer or dealer considered as such for if they increase his money returns they increase in the same degree all his expenses <\s>
<s> there is no mode in which capitalists can compensate themselves for a high cost of labor through any action on values or prices <\s>
<s> it can not be prevented from taking its effect in low profits <\s>
<s> if the laborers really get more that is get the produce of more labor a smaller percentage must remain for profit <\s>
<s> the monopolist can fix the value as high as he pleases short of what the consumer either could not or would not pay but he can only do so by limiting the supply <\s>
<s> monopoly value therefore does not depend on any peculiar principle but is a mere variety of the ordinary case of demand and supply <\s>
<s> again though there are few commodities which are at all times and forever unsusceptible of increase of supply any commodity whatever may be temporarily so and with some commodities this is habitually the case <\s>
<s> agricultural produce for example can not be increased in quantity before the next harvest the quantity of corn already existing in the world is all that can be had for sometimes a year to come <\s>
<s> during that interval corn is practically assimilated to things of which the quantity can not be increased <\s>
<s> in the case of most commodities it requires a certain time to increase their quantity and if the demand increases then until a corresponding supply can be brought forward that is until the supply can accommodate itself to the demand the value will so rise as to accommodate the demand to the supply <\s>
<s> there is another case the exact converse of this <\s>
<s> there are some articles of which the supply may be indefinitely increased but can not be rapidly diminished <\s>
<s> there are things so durable that the quantity in existence is at all times very great in comparison with the annual produce <\s>
<s> gold and the more durable metals are things of this sort and also houses <\s>
<s> the supply of such things might be at once diminished by destroying them but to do this could only be the interest of the possessor if he had a monopoly of the article and could repay himself for the destruction of a part by the increased value of the remainder <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such things may continue for a long time so low either from excess of supply or falling off in the demand as to put a complete stop to further production the diminution of supply by wearing out being so slow a process that a long time is requisite even under a total suspension of production to restore the original value <\s>
<s> during that interval the value will be regulated solely by supply and demand and will rise very gradually as the existing stock wears out until there is again a remunerating value and production resumes its course <\s>
<s> the total value of gold and silver in the world is variously estimated at from 10,000 000,000 to 14,000 000,000 while the annual production of both gold and silver in the world during 1882 211 was only 212,000 000 <\s>
<s> the loss of gold by abrasion is about 1/1000 annually and of silver about 1/700 but much depends on the size of the coin <\s>
<s> a change in the annual production of the precious metals can have a perceptible effect on their value only after such a time as will permit the change to affect the existing quantity in a way somewhat comparable with its previous amount <\s>
<s> the quantity however of wheat produced is nearly all consumed between harvests and the annual supply bears a very large ratio to the existing quantity <\s>
<s> consequently the price of wheat will be very seriously affected by the quantity coming from the annual product <\s>
<s> finally there are commodities of which though capable of being increased or diminished to a great and even an unlimited extent the value never depends upon anything but demand and supply <\s>
<s> this is the case in particular with the commodity labor of the value of which we have treated copiously in the preceding book and there are many cases besides in which we shall find it necessary to call in this principle to solve difficult questions of exchange value <\s>

<s> commodities which are susceptible of indefinite multiplication without increase of cost <\s>
<s> law of their value cost of production <\s>
<s> when the production of a commodity is the effect of labor and expenditure whether the commodity is susceptible of unlimited multiplication or not there is a minimum value which is the essential condition of its being permanently produced <\s>
<s> the value at any particular time is the result of supply and demand and is always that which is necessary to create a market for the existing supply <\s>
<s> but unless that value is sufficient to repay the cost of production and to afford besides the ordinary expectation of profit the commodity will not continue to be produced <\s>
<s> capitalists will not go on permanently producing at a loss <\s>
<s> when such profit is evidently not to be had if people do not actually withdraw their capital they at least abstain from replacing it when consumed <\s>
<s> the cost of production together with the ordinary profit may therefore be called the necessary price or value of all things made by labor and capital <\s>
<s> nobody willingly produces in the prospect of loss <\s>
<s> when a commodity is not only made by labor and capital but can be made by them in indefinite quantity this necessary value the minimum with which the producers will be content is also if competition is free and active the maximum which they can expect <\s>
<s> if the value of a commodity is such that it repays the cost of production not only with the customary but with a higher rate of profit capital rushes to share in this extra gain and by increasing the supply of the article reduces its value <\s>
<s> this is not a mere supposition or surmise but a fact familiar to those conversant with commercial operations <\s>
<s> whenever a new line of business presents itself offering a hope of unusual profits and whenever any established trade or manufacture is believed to be yielding a greater profit than customary there is sure to be in a short time so large a production or importation of the commodity as not only destroys the extra profit but generally goes beyond the mark and sinks the value as much too low as it had before been raised too high until the over supply is corrected by a total or partial suspension of further production <\s>
<s> as already intimated 212 these variations in the quantity produced do not presuppose or require that any person should change his employment <\s>
<s> those whose business is thriving increase their produce by availing themselves more largely of their credit while those who are not making the ordinary profit restrict their operations and in manufacturing phrase work short time <\s>
<s> in this mode is surely and speedily effected the equalization not of profits perhaps but of the expectations of profit in different occupations <\s>
<s> as a general rule then things tend to exchange for one another at such values as will enable each producer to be repaid the cost of production with the ordinary profit in other words such as will give to all producers the same rate of profit on their outlay <\s>
<s> but in order that the profit may be equal where the outlay that is the cost of production is equal things must on the average exchange for one another in the ratio of their cost of production things of which the cost of production is the same must be of the same value <\s>
<s> mill has here used cost of production almost exactly in the sense of cost of labor and as excluding profit while in the next chapter he includes some part of profit in the analysis <\s>

<s> having thus pointed out what is mr <\s>
<s> mills conception of cost of production it will remain for us in the next chapter to consider whether any other view of it is more satisfactory <\s>
<s> adam smith and ricardo have called that value of a thing which is proportional to its cost of production its natural value or its natural price <\s>
<s> they meant by this the point about which the value oscillates and to which it always tends to return the center value toward which as adam smith expresses it the market value of a thing is constantly gravitating and any deviation from which is but a temporary irregularity which the moment it exists sets forces in motion tending to correct it <\s>
<s> on an average of years sufficient to enable the oscillations on one side of the central line to be compensated by those on the other the market value agrees with the natural value but it very seldom coincides exactly with it at any particular time <\s>
<s> the sea everywhere tends to a level but it never is at an exact level its surface is always ruffled by waves and often agitated by storms <\s>

<s> the value of these commodities confirm in the long run to their cost of production through the operation of demand and supply <\s>
<s> the latent influence by which the values of things are made to conform in the long run to the cost of production is the variation that would otherwise take place in the supply of the commodity <\s>
<s> the supply would be increased if the thing continued to sell above the ratio of its cost of production and would be diminished if it fell below that ratio <\s>
<s> if one dollar covers the expense of making one spade then when a spade by virtue of a sudden demand rises in value to one dollar and ten cents the manufacturers get an extra profit of ten cents <\s>
<s> this could not long remain so because other capital would enter this industry and so increase the supply that one spade would sell for only one dollar then all would receive the average profit <\s>
<s> if owing to a cessation of demand for spades the price fell to ninety cents then the manufacturers would lose ten cents on each one made and sold <\s>
<s> thereupon they would cease to do a losing business capital would be withdrawn and spades would not be made until the supply was suited to the necessary expense of making them one dollar <\s>
<s> in this way whenever there is a departure of the value from the normal cost there is set in motion ipso facto a series of forces which automatically restores the value to that cost <\s>
<s> so here again we see the nature of an economic law the value may not often correspond exactly with cost of production but there is a tendency in all values to conform to that cost and this tendency they irresistibly obey <\s>
<s> a body possessing weight does not move downward under all circumstances stones may be thrown upward but the law of gravitation holds true nevertheless <\s>
<s> there is no need that there should be any actual alteration of supply and when there is the alteration if permanent is not the cause but the consequence of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> if indeed the supply could not be increased no diminution in the cost of production would lower the value but there is by no means any necessity that it should <\s>

<s> before the electric light was yet known as a feasible means of lighting in 1878 the mere rumor of edisons invention before it was made public and long before it became practicable caused a serious fall in the price of gas stocks <\s>

<s> what the production of a thing costs to its producer or its series of producers is the labor expended in producing it <\s>
<s> if we consider as the producer the capitalist who makes the advances the word labor may be replaced by the word wages what the produce costs to him is the wages which he has had to pay <\s>
<s> at the first glance indeed this seems to be only a part of his outlay since he has not only paid wages to laborers but has likewise provided them with tools materials and perhaps buildings <\s>
<s> these tools materials and buildings however were produced by labor and capital and their value like that of the article to the production of which they are subservient depends on cost of production which again is resolvable into labor <\s>
<s> the cost of production of broadcloth does not wholly consist in the wages of weavers which alone are directly paid by the cloth manufacturer <\s>
<s> it consists also of the wages of spinners and wool combers and it may be added of shepherds all of which the clothier has paid for in the price of yarn <\s>
<s> it consists too of the wages of builders and brick makers which he has reimbursed in the contract price of erecting his factory <\s>
<s> it partly consists of the wages of machine makers iron founders and miners <\s>
<s> and to these must be added the wages of the carriers who transported any of the means and appliances of the production to the place where they were to be used and the product itself to the place where it is to be sold <\s>
<s> confirmation is here given in the above words of the opinion that in mr <\s>
<s> mills mind cost of production was looked at wholly from the stand point of the capitalist and was identical with cost of labor to the capitalist <\s>
<s> the value of commodities therefore depends principally we shall presently see whether it depends solely on the quantity of labor required for their production including in the idea of production that of conveyance to the market <\s>
<s> but since the cost of production to the capitalist is not labor but wages and since wages may be either greater or less the quantity of labor being the same it would seem that the value of the product can not be determined solely by the quantity of labor but by the quantity together with the remuneration and that values must partly depend on wages <\s>
<s> now the relation of one thing to another can not be altered by any cause which affects them both alike <\s>
<s> a rise or fall of general wages is a fact which affects all commodities in the same manner and therefore affords no reason why they should exchange for each other in one rather than in another proportion <\s>
<s> though there is no such thing as a general rise of values there is such a thing as a general rise of prices <\s>
<s> as soon as we form distinctly the idea of values we see that high or low wages can have nothing to do with them but that high wages make high prices is a popular and widely spread opinion <\s>
<s> the whole amount of error involved in this proposition can only be seen thoroughly when we come to the theory of money at present we need only say that if it be true there can be no such thing as a real rise of wages for if wages could not rise without a proportional rise of the price of everything they could not for any substantial purpose rise at all <\s>
<s> it must be remembered too that general high prices even supposing them to exist can be of no use to a producer or dealer considered as such for if they increase his money returns they increase in the same degree all his expenses <\s>
<s> there is no mode in which capitalists can compensate themselves for a high cost of labor through any action on values or prices <\s>
<s> it can not be prevented from taking its effect in low profits <\s>
<s> if the laborers really get more that is get the produce of more labor a smaller percentage must remain for profit <\s>
<s> the monopolist can fix the value as high as he pleases short of what the consumer either could not or would not pay but he can only do so by limiting the supply <\s>
<s> monopoly value therefore does not depend on any peculiar principle but is a mere variety of the ordinary case of demand and supply <\s>
<s> again though there are few commodities which are at all times and forever unsusceptible of increase of supply any commodity whatever may be temporarily so and with some commodities this is habitually the case <\s>
<s> agricultural produce for example can not be increased in quantity before the next harvest the quantity of corn already existing in the world is all that can be had for sometimes a year to come <\s>
<s> during that interval corn is practically assimilated to things of which the quantity can not be increased <\s>
<s> in the case of most commodities it requires a certain time to increase their quantity and if the demand increases then until a corresponding supply can be brought forward that is until the supply can accommodate itself to the demand the value will so rise as to accommodate the demand to the supply <\s>
<s> there is another case the exact converse of this <\s>
<s> there are some articles of which the supply may be indefinitely increased but can not be rapidly diminished <\s>
<s> there are things so durable that the quantity in existence is at all times very great in comparison with the annual produce <\s>
<s> gold and the more durable metals are things of this sort and also houses <\s>
<s> the supply of such things might be at once diminished by destroying them but to do this could only be the interest of the possessor if he had a monopoly of the article and could repay himself for the destruction of a part by the increased value of the remainder <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such things may continue for a long time so low either from excess of supply or falling off in the demand as to put a complete stop to further production the diminution of supply by wearing out being so slow a process that a long time is requisite even under a total suspension of production to restore the original value <\s>
<s> during that interval the value will be regulated solely by supply and demand and will rise very gradually as the existing stock wears out until there is again a remunerating value and production resumes its course <\s>
<s> the total value of gold and silver in the world is variously estimated at from 10,000 000,000 to 14,000 000,000 while the annual production of both gold and silver in the world during 1882 211 was only 212,000 000 <\s>
<s> the loss of gold by abrasion is about 1/1000 annually and of silver about 1/700 but much depends on the size of the coin <\s>
<s> a change in the annual production of the precious metals can have a perceptible effect on their value only after such a time as will permit the change to affect the existing quantity in a way somewhat comparable with its previous amount <\s>
<s> the quantity however of wheat produced is nearly all consumed between harvests and the annual supply bears a very large ratio to the existing quantity <\s>
<s> consequently the price of wheat will be very seriously affected by the quantity coming from the annual product <\s>
<s> finally there are commodities of which though capable of being increased or diminished to a great and even an unlimited extent the value never depends upon anything but demand and supply <\s>
<s> this is the case in particular with the commodity labor of the value of which we have treated copiously in the preceding book and there are many cases besides in which we shall find it necessary to call in this principle to solve difficult questions of exchange value <\s>

<s> commodities which are susceptible of indefinite multiplication without increase of cost <\s>
<s> law of their value cost of production <\s>
<s> when the production of a commodity is the effect of labor and expenditure whether the commodity is susceptible of unlimited multiplication or not there is a minimum value which is the essential condition of its being permanently produced <\s>
<s> the value at any particular time is the result of supply and demand and is always that which is necessary to create a market for the existing supply <\s>
<s> but unless that value is sufficient to repay the cost of production and to afford besides the ordinary expectation of profit the commodity will not continue to be produced <\s>
<s> capitalists will not go on permanently producing at a loss <\s>
<s> when such profit is evidently not to be had if people do not actually withdraw their capital they at least abstain from replacing it when consumed <\s>
<s> the cost of production together with the ordinary profit may therefore be called the necessary price or value of all things made by labor and capital <\s>
<s> nobody willingly produces in the prospect of loss <\s>
<s> when a commodity is not only made by labor and capital but can be made by them in indefinite quantity this necessary value the minimum with which the producers will be content is also if competition is free and active the maximum which they can expect <\s>
<s> if the value of a commodity is such that it repays the cost of production not only with the customary but with a higher rate of profit capital rushes to share in this extra gain and by increasing the supply of the article reduces its value <\s>
<s> this is not a mere supposition or surmise but a fact familiar to those conversant with commercial operations <\s>
<s> whenever a new line of business presents itself offering a hope of unusual profits and whenever any established trade or manufacture is believed to be yielding a greater profit than customary there is sure to be in a short time so large a production or importation of the commodity as not only destroys the extra profit but generally goes beyond the mark and sinks the value as much too low as it had before been raised too high until the over supply is corrected by a total or partial suspension of further production <\s>
<s> as already intimated 212 these variations in the quantity produced do not presuppose or require that any person should change his employment <\s>
<s> those whose business is thriving increase their produce by availing themselves more largely of their credit while those who are not making the ordinary profit restrict their operations and in manufacturing phrase work short time <\s>
<s> in this mode is surely and speedily effected the equalization not of profits perhaps but of the expectations of profit in different occupations <\s>
<s> as a general rule then things tend to exchange for one another at such values as will enable each producer to be repaid the cost of production with the ordinary profit in other words such as will give to all producers the same rate of profit on their outlay <\s>
<s> but in order that the profit may be equal where the outlay that is the cost of production is equal things must on the average exchange for one another in the ratio of their cost of production things of which the cost of production is the same must be of the same value <\s>
<s> mill has here used cost of production almost exactly in the sense of cost of labor and as excluding profit while in the next chapter he includes some part of profit in the analysis <\s>

<s> having thus pointed out what is mr <\s>
<s> mills conception of cost of production it will remain for us in the next chapter to consider whether any other view of it is more satisfactory <\s>
<s> adam smith and ricardo have called that value of a thing which is proportional to its cost of production its natural value or its natural price <\s>
<s> they meant by this the point about which the value oscillates and to which it always tends to return the center value toward which as adam smith expresses it the market value of a thing is constantly gravitating and any deviation from which is but a temporary irregularity which the moment it exists sets forces in motion tending to correct it <\s>
<s> on an average of years sufficient to enable the oscillations on one side of the central line to be compensated by those on the other the market value agrees with the natural value but it very seldom coincides exactly with it at any particular time <\s>
<s> the sea everywhere tends to a level but it never is at an exact level its surface is always ruffled by waves and often agitated by storms <\s>

<s> the value of these commodities confirm in the long run to their cost of production through the operation of demand and supply <\s>
<s> the latent influence by which the values of things are made to conform in the long run to the cost of production is the variation that would otherwise take place in the supply of the commodity <\s>
<s> the supply would be increased if the thing continued to sell above the ratio of its cost of production and would be diminished if it fell below that ratio <\s>
<s> if one dollar covers the expense of making one spade then when a spade by virtue of a sudden demand rises in value to one dollar and ten cents the manufacturers get an extra profit of ten cents <\s>
<s> this could not long remain so because other capital would enter this industry and so increase the supply that one spade would sell for only one dollar then all would receive the average profit <\s>
<s> if owing to a cessation of demand for spades the price fell to ninety cents then the manufacturers would lose ten cents on each one made and sold <\s>
<s> thereupon they would cease to do a losing business capital would be withdrawn and spades would not be made until the supply was suited to the necessary expense of making them one dollar <\s>
<s> in this way whenever there is a departure of the value from the normal cost there is set in motion ipso facto a series of forces which automatically restores the value to that cost <\s>
<s> so here again we see the nature of an economic law the value may not often correspond exactly with cost of production but there is a tendency in all values to conform to that cost and this tendency they irresistibly obey <\s>
<s> a body possessing weight does not move downward under all circumstances stones may be thrown upward but the law of gravitation holds true nevertheless <\s>
<s> there is no need that there should be any actual alteration of supply and when there is the alteration if permanent is not the cause but the consequence of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> if indeed the supply could not be increased no diminution in the cost of production would lower the value but there is by no means any necessity that it should <\s>

<s> before the electric light was yet known as a feasible means of lighting in 1878 the mere rumor of edisons invention before it was made public and long before it became practicable caused a serious fall in the price of gas stocks <\s>

<s> what the production of a thing costs to its producer or its series of producers is the labor expended in producing it <\s>
<s> if we consider as the producer the capitalist who makes the advances the word labor may be replaced by the word wages what the produce costs to him is the wages which he has had to pay <\s>
<s> at the first glance indeed this seems to be only a part of his outlay since he has not only paid wages to laborers but has likewise provided them with tools materials and perhaps buildings <\s>
<s> these tools materials and buildings however were produced by labor and capital and their value like that of the article to the production of which they are subservient depends on cost of production which again is resolvable into labor <\s>
<s> the cost of production of broadcloth does not wholly consist in the wages of weavers which alone are directly paid by the cloth manufacturer <\s>
<s> it consists also of the wages of spinners and wool combers and it may be added of shepherds all of which the clothier has paid for in the price of yarn <\s>
<s> it consists too of the wages of builders and brick makers which he has reimbursed in the contract price of erecting his factory <\s>
<s> it partly consists of the wages of machine makers iron founders and miners <\s>
<s> and to these must be added the wages of the carriers who transported any of the means and appliances of the production to the place where they were to be used and the product itself to the place where it is to be sold <\s>
<s> confirmation is here given in the above words of the opinion that in mr <\s>
<s> mills mind cost of production was looked at wholly from the stand point of the capitalist and was identical with cost of labor to the capitalist <\s>
<s> the value of commodities therefore depends principally we shall presently see whether it depends solely on the quantity of labor required for their production including in the idea of production that of conveyance to the market <\s>
<s> but since the cost of production to the capitalist is not labor but wages and since wages may be either greater or less the quantity of labor being the same it would seem that the value of the product can not be determined solely by the quantity of labor but by the quantity together with the remuneration and that values must partly depend on wages <\s>
<s> now the relation of one thing to another can not be altered by any cause which affects them both alike <\s>
<s> a rise or fall of general wages is a fact which affects all commodities in the same manner and therefore affords no reason why they should exchange for each other in one rather than in another proportion <\s>
<s> though there is no such thing as a general rise of values there is such a thing as a general rise of prices <\s>
<s> as soon as we form distinctly the idea of values we see that high or low wages can have nothing to do with them but that high wages make high prices is a popular and widely spread opinion <\s>
<s> the whole amount of error involved in this proposition can only be seen thoroughly when we come to the theory of money at present we need only say that if it be true there can be no such thing as a real rise of wages for if wages could not rise without a proportional rise of the price of everything they could not for any substantial purpose rise at all <\s>
<s> it must be remembered too that general high prices even supposing them to exist can be of no use to a producer or dealer considered as such for if they increase his money returns they increase in the same degree all his expenses <\s>
<s> there is no mode in which capitalists can compensate themselves for a high cost of labor through any action on values or prices <\s>
<s> it can not be prevented from taking its effect in low profits <\s>
<s> if the laborers really get more that is get the produce of more labor a smaller percentage must remain for profit <\s>
<s> the monopolist can fix the value as high as he pleases short of what the consumer either could not or would not pay but he can only do so by limiting the supply <\s>
<s> monopoly value therefore does not depend on any peculiar principle but is a mere variety of the ordinary case of demand and supply <\s>
<s> again though there are few commodities which are at all times and forever unsusceptible of increase of supply any commodity whatever may be temporarily so and with some commodities this is habitually the case <\s>
<s> agricultural produce for example can not be increased in quantity before the next harvest the quantity of corn already existing in the world is all that can be had for sometimes a year to come <\s>
<s> during that interval corn is practically assimilated to things of which the quantity can not be increased <\s>
<s> in the case of most commodities it requires a certain time to increase their quantity and if the demand increases then until a corresponding supply can be brought forward that is until the supply can accommodate itself to the demand the value will so rise as to accommodate the demand to the supply <\s>
<s> there is another case the exact converse of this <\s>
<s> there are some articles of which the supply may be indefinitely increased but can not be rapidly diminished <\s>
<s> there are things so durable that the quantity in existence is at all times very great in comparison with the annual produce <\s>
<s> gold and the more durable metals are things of this sort and also houses <\s>
<s> the supply of such things might be at once diminished by destroying them but to do this could only be the interest of the possessor if he had a monopoly of the article and could repay himself for the destruction of a part by the increased value of the remainder <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such things may continue for a long time so low either from excess of supply or falling off in the demand as to put a complete stop to further production the diminution of supply by wearing out being so slow a process that a long time is requisite even under a total suspension of production to restore the original value <\s>
<s> during that interval the value will be regulated solely by supply and demand and will rise very gradually as the existing stock wears out until there is again a remunerating value and production resumes its course <\s>
<s> the total value of gold and silver in the world is variously estimated at from 10,000 000,000 to 14,000 000,000 while the annual production of both gold and silver in the world during 1882 211 was only 212,000 000 <\s>
<s> the loss of gold by abrasion is about 1/1000 annually and of silver about 1/700 but much depends on the size of the coin <\s>
<s> a change in the annual production of the precious metals can have a perceptible effect on their value only after such a time as will permit the change to affect the existing quantity in a way somewhat comparable with its previous amount <\s>
<s> the quantity however of wheat produced is nearly all consumed between harvests and the annual supply bears a very large ratio to the existing quantity <\s>
<s> consequently the price of wheat will be very seriously affected by the quantity coming from the annual product <\s>
<s> finally there are commodities of which though capable of being increased or diminished to a great and even an unlimited extent the value never depends upon anything but demand and supply <\s>
<s> this is the case in particular with the commodity labor of the value of which we have treated copiously in the preceding book and there are many cases besides in which we shall find it necessary to call in this principle to solve difficult questions of exchange value <\s>

<s> commodities which are susceptible of indefinite multiplication without increase of cost <\s>
<s> law of their value cost of production <\s>
<s> when the production of a commodity is the effect of labor and expenditure whether the commodity is susceptible of unlimited multiplication or not there is a minimum value which is the essential condition of its being permanently produced <\s>
<s> the value at any particular time is the result of supply and demand and is always that which is necessary to create a market for the existing supply <\s>
<s> but unless that value is sufficient to repay the cost of production and to afford besides the ordinary expectation of profit the commodity will not continue to be produced <\s>
<s> capitalists will not go on permanently producing at a loss <\s>
<s> when such profit is evidently not to be had if people do not actually withdraw their capital they at least abstain from replacing it when consumed <\s>
<s> the cost of production together with the ordinary profit may therefore be called the necessary price or value of all things made by labor and capital <\s>
<s> nobody willingly produces in the prospect of loss <\s>
<s> when a commodity is not only made by labor and capital but can be made by them in indefinite quantity this necessary value the minimum with which the producers will be content is also if competition is free and active the maximum which they can expect <\s>
<s> if the value of a commodity is such that it repays the cost of production not only with the customary but with a higher rate of profit capital rushes to share in this extra gain and by increasing the supply of the article reduces its value <\s>
<s> this is not a mere supposition or surmise but a fact familiar to those conversant with commercial operations <\s>
<s> whenever a new line of business presents itself offering a hope of unusual profits and whenever any established trade or manufacture is believed to be yielding a greater profit than customary there is sure to be in a short time so large a production or importation of the commodity as not only destroys the extra profit but generally goes beyond the mark and sinks the value as much too low as it had before been raised too high until the over supply is corrected by a total or partial suspension of further production <\s>
<s> as already intimated 212 these variations in the quantity produced do not presuppose or require that any person should change his employment <\s>
<s> those whose business is thriving increase their produce by availing themselves more largely of their credit while those who are not making the ordinary profit restrict their operations and in manufacturing phrase work short time <\s>
<s> in this mode is surely and speedily effected the equalization not of profits perhaps but of the expectations of profit in different occupations <\s>
<s> as a general rule then things tend to exchange for one another at such values as will enable each producer to be repaid the cost of production with the ordinary profit in other words such as will give to all producers the same rate of profit on their outlay <\s>
<s> but in order that the profit may be equal where the outlay that is the cost of production is equal things must on the average exchange for one another in the ratio of their cost of production things of which the cost of production is the same must be of the same value <\s>
<s> mill has here used cost of production almost exactly in the sense of cost of labor and as excluding profit while in the next chapter he includes some part of profit in the analysis <\s>

<s> having thus pointed out what is mr <\s>
<s> mills conception of cost of production it will remain for us in the next chapter to consider whether any other view of it is more satisfactory <\s>
<s> adam smith and ricardo have called that value of a thing which is proportional to its cost of production its natural value or its natural price <\s>
<s> they meant by this the point about which the value oscillates and to which it always tends to return the center value toward which as adam smith expresses it the market value of a thing is constantly gravitating and any deviation from which is but a temporary irregularity which the moment it exists sets forces in motion tending to correct it <\s>
<s> on an average of years sufficient to enable the oscillations on one side of the central line to be compensated by those on the other the market value agrees with the natural value but it very seldom coincides exactly with it at any particular time <\s>
<s> the sea everywhere tends to a level but it never is at an exact level its surface is always ruffled by waves and often agitated by storms <\s>

<s> the value of these commodities confirm in the long run to their cost of production through the operation of demand and supply <\s>
<s> the latent influence by which the values of things are made to conform in the long run to the cost of production is the variation that would otherwise take place in the supply of the commodity <\s>
<s> the supply would be increased if the thing continued to sell above the ratio of its cost of production and would be diminished if it fell below that ratio <\s>
<s> if one dollar covers the expense of making one spade then when a spade by virtue of a sudden demand rises in value to one dollar and ten cents the manufacturers get an extra profit of ten cents <\s>
<s> this could not long remain so because other capital would enter this industry and so increase the supply that one spade would sell for only one dollar then all would receive the average profit <\s>
<s> if owing to a cessation of demand for spades the price fell to ninety cents then the manufacturers would lose ten cents on each one made and sold <\s>
<s> thereupon they would cease to do a losing business capital would be withdrawn and spades would not be made until the supply was suited to the necessary expense of making them one dollar <\s>
<s> in this way whenever there is a departure of the value from the normal cost there is set in motion ipso facto a series of forces which automatically restores the value to that cost <\s>
<s> so here again we see the nature of an economic law the value may not often correspond exactly with cost of production but there is a tendency in all values to conform to that cost and this tendency they irresistibly obey <\s>
<s> a body possessing weight does not move downward under all circumstances stones may be thrown upward but the law of gravitation holds true nevertheless <\s>
<s> there is no need that there should be any actual alteration of supply and when there is the alteration if permanent is not the cause but the consequence of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> if indeed the supply could not be increased no diminution in the cost of production would lower the value but there is by no means any necessity that it should <\s>

<s> before the electric light was yet known as a feasible means of lighting in 1878 the mere rumor of edisons invention before it was made public and long before it became practicable caused a serious fall in the price of gas stocks <\s>

<s> what the production of a thing costs to its producer or its series of producers is the labor expended in producing it <\s>
<s> if we consider as the producer the capitalist who makes the advances the word labor may be replaced by the word wages what the produce costs to him is the wages which he has had to pay <\s>
<s> at the first glance indeed this seems to be only a part of his outlay since he has not only paid wages to laborers but has likewise provided them with tools materials and perhaps buildings <\s>
<s> these tools materials and buildings however were produced by labor and capital and their value like that of the article to the production of which they are subservient depends on cost of production which again is resolvable into labor <\s>
<s> the cost of production of broadcloth does not wholly consist in the wages of weavers which alone are directly paid by the cloth manufacturer <\s>
<s> it consists also of the wages of spinners and wool combers and it may be added of shepherds all of which the clothier has paid for in the price of yarn <\s>
<s> it consists too of the wages of builders and brick makers which he has reimbursed in the contract price of erecting his factory <\s>
<s> it partly consists of the wages of machine makers iron founders and miners <\s>
<s> and to these must be added the wages of the carriers who transported any of the means and appliances of the production to the place where they were to be used and the product itself to the place where it is to be sold <\s>
<s> confirmation is here given in the above words of the opinion that in mr <\s>
<s> mills mind cost of production was looked at wholly from the stand point of the capitalist and was identical with cost of labor to the capitalist <\s>
<s> the value of commodities therefore depends principally we shall presently see whether it depends solely on the quantity of labor required for their production including in the idea of production that of conveyance to the market <\s>
<s> but since the cost of production to the capitalist is not labor but wages and since wages may be either greater or less the quantity of labor being the same it would seem that the value of the product can not be determined solely by the quantity of labor but by the quantity together with the remuneration and that values must partly depend on wages <\s>
<s> now the relation of one thing to another can not be altered by any cause which affects them both alike <\s>
<s> a rise or fall of general wages is a fact which affects all commodities in the same manner and therefore affords no reason why they should exchange for each other in one rather than in another proportion <\s>
<s> though there is no such thing as a general rise of values there is such a thing as a general rise of prices <\s>
<s> as soon as we form distinctly the idea of values we see that high or low wages can have nothing to do with them but that high wages make high prices is a popular and widely spread opinion <\s>
<s> the whole amount of error involved in this proposition can only be seen thoroughly when we come to the theory of money at present we need only say that if it be true there can be no such thing as a real rise of wages for if wages could not rise without a proportional rise of the price of everything they could not for any substantial purpose rise at all <\s>
<s> it must be remembered too that general high prices even supposing them to exist can be of no use to a producer or dealer considered as such for if they increase his money returns they increase in the same degree all his expenses <\s>
<s> there is no mode in which capitalists can compensate themselves for a high cost of labor through any action on values or prices <\s>
<s> it can not be prevented from taking its effect in low profits <\s>
<s> if the laborers really get more that is get the produce of more labor a smaller percentage must remain for profit <\s>
<s> the monopolist can fix the value as high as he pleases short of what the consumer either could not or would not pay but he can only do so by limiting the supply <\s>
<s> monopoly value therefore does not depend on any peculiar principle but is a mere variety of the ordinary case of demand and supply <\s>
<s> again though there are few commodities which are at all times and forever unsusceptible of increase of supply any commodity whatever may be temporarily so and with some commodities this is habitually the case <\s>
<s> agricultural produce for example can not be increased in quantity before the next harvest the quantity of corn already existing in the world is all that can be had for sometimes a year to come <\s>
<s> during that interval corn is practically assimilated to things of which the quantity can not be increased <\s>
<s> in the case of most commodities it requires a certain time to increase their quantity and if the demand increases then until a corresponding supply can be brought forward that is until the supply can accommodate itself to the demand the value will so rise as to accommodate the demand to the supply <\s>
<s> there is another case the exact converse of this <\s>
<s> there are some articles of which the supply may be indefinitely increased but can not be rapidly diminished <\s>
<s> there are things so durable that the quantity in existence is at all times very great in comparison with the annual produce <\s>
<s> gold and the more durable metals are things of this sort and also houses <\s>
<s> the supply of such things might be at once diminished by destroying them but to do this could only be the interest of the possessor if he had a monopoly of the article and could repay himself for the destruction of a part by the increased value of the remainder <\s>
<s> the value therefore of such things may continue for a long time so low either from excess of supply or falling off in the demand as to put a complete stop to further production the diminution of supply by wearing out being so slow a process that a long time is requisite even under a total suspension of production to restore the original value <\s>
<s> during that interval the value will be regulated solely by supply and demand and will rise very gradually as the existing stock wears out until there is again a remunerating value and production resumes its course <\s>
<s> the total value of gold and silver in the world is variously estimated at from 10,000 000,000 to 14,000 000,000 while the annual production of both gold and silver in the world during 1882 211 was only 212,000 000 <\s>
<s> the loss of gold by abrasion is about 1/1000 annually and of silver about 1/700 but much depends on the size of the coin <\s>
<s> a change in the annual production of the precious metals can have a perceptible effect on their value only after such a time as will permit the change to affect the existing quantity in a way somewhat comparable with its previous amount <\s>
<s> the quantity however of wheat produced is nearly all consumed between harvests and the annual supply bears a very large ratio to the existing quantity <\s>
<s> consequently the price of wheat will be very seriously affected by the quantity coming from the annual product <\s>
<s> finally there are commodities of which though capable of being increased or diminished to a great and even an unlimited extent the value never depends upon anything but demand and supply <\s>
<s> this is the case in particular with the commodity labor of the value of which we have treated copiously in the preceding book and there are many cases besides in which we shall find it necessary to call in this principle to solve difficult questions of exchange value <\s>

<s> commodities which are susceptible of indefinite multiplication without increase of cost <\s>
<s> law of their value cost of production <\s>
<s> when the production of a commodity is the effect of labor and expenditure whether the commodity is susceptible of unlimited multiplication or not there is a minimum value which is the essential condition of its being permanently produced <\s>
<s> the value at any particular time is the result of supply and demand and is always that which is necessary to create a market for the existing supply <\s>
<s> but unless that value is sufficient to repay the cost of production and to afford besides the ordinary expectation of profit the commodity will not continue to be produced <\s>
<s> capitalists will not go on permanently producing at a loss <\s>
<s> when such profit is evidently not to be had if people do not actually withdraw their capital they at least abstain from replacing it when consumed <\s>
<s> the cost of production together with the ordinary profit may therefore be called the necessary price or value of all things made by labor and capital <\s>
<s> nobody willingly produces in the prospect of loss <\s>
<s> when a commodity is not only made by labor and capital but can be made by them in indefinite quantity this necessary value the minimum with which the producers will be content is also if competition is free and active the maximum which they can expect <\s>
<s> if the value of a commodity is such that it repays the cost of production not only with the customary but with a higher rate of profit capital rushes to share in this extra gain and by increasing the supply of the article reduces its value <\s>
<s> this is not a mere supposition or surmise but a fact familiar to those conversant with commercial operations <\s>
<s> whenever a new line of business presents itself offering a hope of unusual profits and whenever any established trade or manufacture is believed to be yielding a greater profit than customary there is sure to be in a short time so large a production or importation of the commodity as not only destroys the extra profit but generally goes beyond the mark and sinks the value as much too low as it had before been raised too high until the over supply is corrected by a total or partial suspension of further production <\s>
<s> as already intimated 212 these variations in the quantity produced do not presuppose or require that any person should change his employment <\s>
<s> those whose business is thriving increase their produce by availing themselves more largely of their credit while those who are not making the ordinary profit restrict their operations and in manufacturing phrase work short time <\s>
<s> in this mode is surely and speedily effected the equalization not of profits perhaps but of the expectations of profit in different occupations <\s>
<s> as a general rule then things tend to exchange for one another at such values as will enable each producer to be repaid the cost of production with the ordinary profit in other words such as will give to all producers the same rate of profit on their outlay <\s>
<s> but in order that the profit may be equal where the outlay that is the cost of production is equal things must on the average exchange for one another in the ratio of their cost of production things of which the cost of production is the same must be of the same value <\s>
<s> mill has here used cost of production almost exactly in the sense of cost of labor and as excluding profit while in the next chapter he includes some part of profit in the analysis <\s>

<s> having thus pointed out what is mr <\s>
<s> mills conception of cost of production it will remain for us in the next chapter to consider whether any other view of it is more satisfactory <\s>
<s> adam smith and ricardo have called that value of a thing which is proportional to its cost of production its natural value or its natural price <\s>
<s> they meant by this the point about which the value oscillates and to which it always tends to return the center value toward which as adam smith expresses it the market value of a thing is constantly gravitating and any deviation from which is but a temporary irregularity which the moment it exists sets forces in motion tending to correct it <\s>
<s> on an average of years sufficient to enable the oscillations on one side of the central line to be compensated by those on the other the market value agrees with the natural value but it very seldom coincides exactly with it at any particular time <\s>
<s> the sea everywhere tends to a level but it never is at an exact level its surface is always ruffled by waves and often agitated by storms <\s>

<s> the value of these commodities confirm in the long run to their cost of production through the operation of demand and supply <\s>
<s> the latent influence by which the values of things are made to conform in the long run to the cost of production is the variation that would otherwise take place in the supply of the commodity <\s>
<s> the supply would be increased if the thing continued to sell above the ratio of its cost of production and would be diminished if it fell below that ratio <\s>
<s> if one dollar covers the expense of making one spade then when a spade by virtue of a sudden demand rises in value to one dollar and ten cents the manufacturers get an extra profit of ten cents <\s>
<s> this could not long remain so because other capital would enter this industry and so increase the supply that one spade would sell for only one dollar then all would receive the average profit <\s>
<s> if owing to a cessation of demand for spades the price fell to ninety cents then the manufacturers would lose ten cents on each one made and sold <\s>
<s> thereupon they would cease to do a losing business capital would be withdrawn and spades would not be made until the supply was suited to the necessary expense of making them one dollar <\s>
<s> in this way whenever there is a departure of the value from the normal cost there is set in motion ipso facto a series of forces which automatically restores the value to that cost <\s>
<s> so here again we see the nature of an economic law the value may not often correspond exactly with cost of production but there is a tendency in all values to conform to that cost and this tendency they irresistibly obey <\s>
<s> a body possessing weight does not move downward under all circumstances stones may be thrown upward but the law of gravitation holds true nevertheless <\s>
<s> there is no need that there should be any actual alteration of supply and when there is the alteration if permanent is not the cause but the consequence of the alteration in value <\s>
<s> if indeed the supply could not be increased no diminution in the cost of production would lower the value but there is by no means any necessity that it should <\s>

<s> before the electric light was yet known as a feasible means of lighting in 1878 the mere rumor of edisons invention before it was made public and long before it became practicable caused a serious fall in the price of gas stocks <\s>

<s> the component elements of cost of production have been set forth in the first part of this inquiry 214 the principal of them and so much the principal as to be nearly the sole was found to be labor <\s>
<s> what the production of a thing costs to its producer or its series of producers is the labor expended in producing it <\s>
<s> if we consider as the producer the capitalist who makes the advances the word labor may be replaced by the word wages what the produce costs to him is the wages which he has had to pay <\s>
<s> at the first glance indeed this seems to be only a part of his outlay since he has not only paid wages to laborers but has likewise provided them with tools materials and perhaps buildings <\s>
<s> these tools materials and buildings however were produced by labor and capital and their value like that of the article to the production of which they are subservient depends on cost of production which again is resolvable into labor <\s>
<s> the cost of production of broadcloth does not wholly consist in the wages of weavers which alone are directly paid by the cloth manufacturer <\s>
<s> it consists also of the wages of spinners and wool combers and it may be added of shepherds all of which the clothier has paid for in the price of yarn <\s>
<s> it consists too of the wages of builders and brick makers which he has reimbursed in the contract price of erecting his factory <\s>
<s> it partly consists of the wages of machine makers iron founders and miners <\s>
<s> and to these must be added the wages of the carriers who transported any of the means and appliances of the production to the place where they were to be used and the product itself to the place where it is to be sold <\s>
<s> confirmation is here given in the above words of the opinion that in mr <\s>
<s> mills mind cost of production was looked at wholly from the stand point of the capitalist and was identical with cost of labor to the capitalist <\s>
<s> the value of commodities therefore depends principally we shall presently see whether it depends solely on the quantity of labor required for their production including in the idea of production that of conveyance to the market <\s>
<s> but since the cost of production to the capitalist is not labor but wages and since wages may be either greater or less the quantity of labor being the same it would seem that the value of the product can not be determined solely by the quantity of labor but by the quantity together with the remuneration and that values must partly depend on wages <\s>
<s> now the relation of one thing to another can not be altered by any cause which affects them both alike <\s>
<s> a rise or fall of general wages is a fact which affects all commodities in the same manner and therefore affords no reason why they should exchange for each other in one rather than in another proportion <\s>
<s> though there is no such thing as a general rise of values there is such a thing as a general rise of prices <\s>
<s> as soon as we form distinctly the idea of values we see that high or low wages can have nothing to do with them but that high wages make high prices is a popular and widely spread opinion <\s>
<s> the whole amount of error involved in this proposition can only be seen thoroughly when we come to the theory of money at present we need only say that if it be true there can be no such thing as a real rise of wages for if wages could not rise without a proportional rise of the price of everything they could not for any substantial purpose rise at all <\s>
<s> it must be remembered too that general high prices even supposing them to exist can be of no use to a producer or dealer considered as such for if they increase his money returns they increase in the same degree all his expenses <\s>
<s> there is no mode in which capitalists can compensate themselves for a high cost of labor through any action on values or prices <\s>
<s> it can not be prevented from taking its effect in low profits <\s>
<s> if the laborers really get more that is get the produce of more labor a smaller percentage must remain for profit <\s>

<s> i have never for a moment recommended or countenanced any protecting industry except for the purpose of enabling the protected branch of industry in a very moderate time to become independent of protection <\s>

<s> the rates of wages measured in money are higher in the united states than in europe and therefore it is argued the cost of producing commodities is higher .... <\s>
<s> the high rates of wages in the united states are not peculiar to any branch of industry but are universal throughout its whole range <\s>
<s> if therefore a high rate of wages proves a high cost of production and a high cost of production proves a need of protection it follows that the farmers of illinois and the cotton planters of the southern states stand in as much need of fostering legislation as the cotton spinners of new england or the iron masters of pennsylvania <\s>
<s> a criterion which leads to such results must i think be regarded as sufficiently condemned <\s>

<s> if a high rate of wages in the first of these states be consistent with a low cost of production why may not a high rate of wages in pennsylvania be consistent with a low cost of producing coal and iron <\s>

<s> and now we may see what this claim for protection to american industry founded on the high scale of american remuneration really comes to it is a demand for special legislative aid in consideration of the possession of special industrial facilitiesa complaint in short against the exceptional bounty of nature <\s>
<s>    perhaps i shall here be asked how if the case be soif the high rate of industrial remuneration in america be only evidence of a low cost of productionthe fact is to be explained since fact it undoubtedly is that the people of the united states are unable to compete in neutral markets in the sale of certain important wares with england and other european countries 367 no one will say that the people of new england new york and pennsylvania are deficient in any industrial qualities possessed by the workmen of any country in the world <\s>
<s> how happens it then that enjoying industrial advantages superior to other countries they are yet unable to hold their own against them in the general markets of commerce <\s>
<s> i shall endeavor to meet this objection fairly and in the first place let me state what my contention is with regard to the cost of production in america <\s>
<s> i do not contend that it is low in the case of all commodities capable of being produced in the country but only in that of a large very important but still limited group <\s>
<s> with regard to commodities lying outside this group i hold that the rate of wages is simply no evidence as to the cost of their production one way or the other <\s>
<s> but secondly i beg the reader to consider what is meant by the alleged    inability    of new england and pennsylvania to compete let us say with manchester and sheffield in the manufacture of calico and cutlery <\s>
<s> what it means and what it only can mean is that they are unable to do so consistently with obtaining that rate of remuneration on their industry which is current in the united states <\s>
<s> if only american laborers and capitalists would be content with the wages and profits current in great britain there is nothing that i know of to prevent them from holding their own in any markets to which manchester and sheffield can send their wares <\s>
<s> and this brings us to the heart of the question <\s>
<s> over a large portion of the great field of industry the people of the united states enjoy as compared with those of europe 1 advantages of a very exceptional kind over the rest 2 the advantage is less decided or 3 they stand on a par with europeans or 4 possibly they are in some instances at a disadvantage <\s>
<s> engaging in the branches of industry in which their advantage over europe is great they reap industrial returns proportionally great and so long as they confine themselves to these occupations they can compete in neutral markets against all the world and still secure the high rewards accruing from their exceptionally rich resources <\s>
<s> but the people of the union decline to confine themselves within these liberal bounds <\s>
<s> they would cover the whole domain of industrial activity and think it hard that they should not reap the same rich harvests from every part of the field <\s>
<s> they must descend into the arena with sheffield and manchester and yet secure the rewards of chicago and st <\s>
<s> they must employ european conditions of production and obtain american results <\s>
<s> what is this but to quarrel with the laws of nature <\s>
<s> these laws have assigned to an extensive range of industries carried on in the united states a high scale of return far in excess of what europe can command to a few others a return on a scale not exceeding the european proportion <\s>
<s> american enterprise would engage in all departments alike and obtain upon all the high rewards which nature has assigned only to some <\s>
<s> here we find the real meaning of the    inability    of americans to compete with the    pauper labor    of europe <\s>
<s> they can not do so and at the same time secure the american rate of return on their work <\s>
<s> the inability no doubt exists but it is one created not by the drawbacks but by the exceptional advantages of their position <\s>
<s> it is as if a skilled artisan should complain that he could not compete with the hedger and ditcher <\s>
<s> let him only be content with the hedger and ditchers rate of pay and there will be nothing to prevent him from entering the lists even against this rival    368 it is often said that wages are kept at a high rate in the united states by the existence of protected industries <\s>
<s> on the other hand the truth is that the protected industries must pay the current high rate of wages fixed by the general productiveness of all industries in the country <\s>
<s> when the facts are investigated it is surprising how small a portion of the laborers of the united states are employed in occupations which owe their existence to the tariff <\s>
<s> a general view of the relative numbers engaged in different occupations may be seen by reference to chart no <\s>

<s> chart showing for the united states in 1880 the ratio between the total population over ten years of age and the number of persons reported as engaged in each principal class of gainful occupations <\s>
<s> compiled from the returns of the tenth census by the editor note    the interior square represents the proportion of the population which is accounted for as engaged in gainful occupations <\s>

<s> this class it is to be noted in the census returns includes bakers blacksmiths brick makers builders butchers cabinet makers carpenters carriage makers and so on through the whole list of similar occupations practically unaffected by the tariff so far as protection to them is concerned <\s>
<s> so that at the most there are less than a million laborers engaged in industries directly dependent on the tariff and the number is undoubtedly very much less than a million <\s>
<s> when some writers assert therefore that the existence of customs duties allows industries even including all those employed in producing cotton wool iron and steel to employ less than a million laborers in such a way that the remuneration is fixed for the remaining 16,000 000 laborers in the united states keeping wages high for 16,000 000 by paying current wages for less than a million the extravagance and ignorance of the statement are at once apparent while on the other hand it is distinctly seen that the causes fixing the generally high rates of wages for the 16,000 000 are those governing the majority of occupations and that the less than one million must be paid the wages which can be obtained elsewhere in the more productive industries <\s>
<s> the facts thus strikingly bear out the principles as stated above <\s>
<s> confirmationif confirmation now seems necessarymay be found in a study 370 by our ablest statistician francis a <\s>
<s> walker upon the causes which have operated on the growth of american manufactures <\s>
<s> this growth has not been commensurate he finds with the remarkable inventive and industrial capacity of our people and with the richness of our national resources    i answer that the cause of that comparative failure is found primarily and principally in the extraordinary success of our agriculture as already intimated in what has been said of the investment of capital <\s>
<s> the enormous profits of cultivating a virgin soil without the need of artificial fertilization the advantages which a sparse population derives from the privilege of selecting for tillage only the choicest spots 371 those most accessible most fertile most easily brought under the plow and the consequent abundance of food and other necessaries enjoyed by the agricultural class have tended continually to disparage mechanical industries in the eyes alike of the capitalist looking to the most remunerative investment of his savings and of the laborer seeking that avocation which should promise the most liberal and constant support <\s>
<s>    it has been the competition of the farm with the shop which throughout the entire century of our national independence has most effectually hindered the growth of manufactures <\s>
<s> a people who are privileged to cultivate a reasonably fertile soil under the conditions indicated above can secure for themselves subsistence up to the highest limit of physical well being <\s>
<s> if that people possess the added advantage of great skill in the use of tools and great adroitness in meeting the large and the little exigencies of the occupation and cultivation of the soil the fruits of their labor will include not only everything which is essential to health and comfort but much that is of the nature of luxury    it remains to be said in this connection that workmen are already discerning the practical and real causes at work affecting their wagesaffecting them more directly than any tariff system possibly couldby showing no small alarm at the immigration of foreigners such as the hungarian miners and italian laborers who willingly underbid them <\s>
<s> in other words they are beginning to realize in a practical way the truth that increasing numbers are far more potent than anything else in reducing wages <\s>
<s> so long as immigration is free to any race or nationality there is no such thing as    protection to home laborers    the only protection to themnot that i am urging the desirability of such measurescan come solely from forces which limit the number of workmen who enter into competition with them <\s>
<s> any other protection to laboring men than the prohibition of immigrationwhich no one thinks of except for the chinese    is an economic delusion <\s>
<s> instead of    protecting    them to the extent of affording higher wages the tariff increases the cost of woolen clothing and other articles of their consumption in addition to forcing capital into employments which yield a less return and so insure lower wages <\s>
<s>    on the ground of creating a diversity of industries <\s>
<s> it must be kept in mind that political economy deals only with the phenomena of material wealth it does not supply ethical or political grounds of action <\s>
<s> it is quite conceivable that a legislator in coming to a decision may have to balance economic gains against moral or political losses and may choose to give up the former to prevent the latter <\s>
<s> but the economic truth remains unchanged <\s>
<s> political economy for instance to the question is there any gain in international trade <\s>
<s> would it be a loss of wealth to the community to have the goods formerly bought abroad now produced at home <\s>
<s> the answer is certainly it would <\s>
<s> but here it has been ably urged by intelligent writers that a state has other ends to gain than the accumulation of mere riches that it must aim to secure the greatest moral social and elevating influences possible for the working classes and that while free exchange of goods may add to wealth it may injure the social and political well being of a nation <\s>
<s> so far as these are social and political questions they do not belong to political economy <\s>
<s> but the commonest form of argument is that under free exchange the united states would become purely an    agricultural    country its social horizon would become narrowed and a lower standard of industrial activity would then ensue instead of which it is said we should by protection keep in existence diversified industries by which the national mind may be better stimulated and greater enterprise may be encouraged in all branches of industry <\s>
<s> this argument for    diversity of industries    however is not merely a sociological question it can only be fully discussed from an economic stand point and deserves even more than the brief attention we can give it here <\s>
<s> in the first place as soon as any purely agricultural country gains even a slight density of populationa density only such as to warrant the introduction of the principle of division of laborthere comes an inevitable differentiation of pursuits wholly outside of legislation and through the operation of natural causes <\s>
<s> not all of any population is required in agriculture to provide the whole with food <\s>
<s> the superiority of one country over another in a branch of production often arises only from having begun it sooner <\s>
<s> there may be no inherent advantage on one part or disadvantage on the other but only a present superiority of acquired skill and experience <\s>

<s> this growth has not been commensurate he finds with the remarkable inventive and industrial capacity of our people and with the richness of our national resources    i answer that the cause of that comparative failure is found primarily and principally in the extraordinary success of our agriculture as already intimated in what has been said of the investment of capital <\s>
<s> the enormous profits of cultivating a virgin soil without the need of artificial fertilization the advantages which a sparse population derives from the privilege of selecting for tillage only the choicest spots 371 those most accessible most fertile most easily brought under the plow and the consequent abundance of food and other necessaries enjoyed by the agricultural class have tended continually to disparage mechanical industries in the eyes alike of the capitalist looking to the most remunerative investment of his savings and of the laborer seeking that avocation which should promise the most liberal and constant support <\s>
<s>    it has been the competition of the farm with the shop which throughout the entire century of our national independence has most effectually hindered the growth of manufactures <\s>
<s> a people who are privileged to cultivate a reasonably fertile soil under the conditions indicated above can secure for themselves subsistence up to the highest limit of physical well being <\s>
<s> if that people possess the added advantage of great skill in the use of tools and great adroitness in meeting the large and the little exigencies of the occupation and cultivation of the soil the fruits of their labor will include not only everything which is essential to health and comfort but much that is of the nature of luxury    it remains to be said in this connection that workmen are already discerning the practical and real causes at work affecting their wagesaffecting them more directly than any tariff system possibly couldby showing no small alarm at the immigration of foreigners such as the hungarian miners and italian laborers who willingly underbid them <\s>
<s> in other words they are beginning to realize in a practical way the truth that increasing numbers are far more potent than anything else in reducing wages <\s>
<s> so long as immigration is free to any race or nationality there is no such thing as    protection to home laborers    the only protection to themnot that i am urging the desirability of such measurescan come solely from forces which limit the number of workmen who enter into competition with them <\s>
<s> any other protection to laboring men than the prohibition of immigrationwhich no one thinks of except for the chinese    is an economic delusion <\s>
<s> instead of    protecting    them to the extent of affording higher wages the tariff increases the cost of woolen clothing and other articles of their consumption in addition to forcing capital into employments which yield a less return and so insure lower wages <\s>
<s>    on the ground of creating a diversity of industries <\s>
<s> it must be kept in mind that political economy deals only with the phenomena of material wealth it does not supply ethical or political grounds of action <\s>
<s> it is quite conceivable that a legislator in coming to a decision may have to balance economic gains against moral or political losses and may choose to give up the former to prevent the latter <\s>
<s> but the economic truth remains unchanged <\s>
<s> political economy for instance to the question is there any gain in international trade <\s>
<s> would it be a loss of wealth to the community to have the goods formerly bought abroad now produced at home <\s>
<s> the answer is certainly it would <\s>
<s> but here it has been ably urged by intelligent writers that a state has other ends to gain than the accumulation of mere riches that it must aim to secure the greatest moral social and elevating influences possible for the working classes and that while free exchange of goods may add to wealth it may injure the social and political well being of a nation <\s>
<s> so far as these are social and political questions they do not belong to political economy <\s>
<s> but the commonest form of argument is that under free exchange the united states would become purely an    agricultural    country its social horizon would become narrowed and a lower standard of industrial activity would then ensue instead of which it is said we should by protection keep in existence diversified industries by which the national mind may be better stimulated and greater enterprise may be encouraged in all branches of industry <\s>
<s> this argument for    diversity of industries    however is not merely a sociological question it can only be fully discussed from an economic stand point and deserves even more than the brief attention we can give it here <\s>
<s> in the first place as soon as any purely agricultural country gains even a slight density of populationa density only such as to warrant the introduction of the principle of division of laborthere comes an inevitable differentiation of pursuits wholly outside of legislation and through the operation of natural causes <\s>
<s> not all of any population is required in agriculture to provide the whole with food <\s>
<s> the superiority of one country over another in a branch of production often arises only from having begun it sooner <\s>
<s> there may be no inherent advantage on one part or disadvantage on the other but only a present superiority of acquired skill and experience <\s>
<s> a country which has this skill and experience yet to acquire may in other respects be better adapted to the production than those which were earlier in the field and besides it is a just remark of mr <\s>
<s> rae that nothing has a greater tendency to promote improvements in any branch of production than its trial under a new set of conditions <\s>
<s> but it can not be expected that individuals should at their own risk or rather to their certain loss introduce a new manufacture and bear the burden of carrying it on until the producers have been educated up to the level of those with whom the processes are traditional <\s>
<s> a protecting duty continued for a reasonable time will sometimes be the least inconvenient mode in which the nation can tax itself for the support of such an experiment <\s>
<s> but the protection should be confined to cases in which there is good ground of assurance that the industry which it fosters will after a time be able to dispense with it nor should the domestic producers ever be allowed to expect that it will be continued to them beyond the time necessary for a fair trial of what they are capable of accomplishing <\s>
<s> the great difficulty with this proposal is that it introduces what is inconsistent with mr <\s>
<s> mills general system the socialistic basis of state help instead of self help <\s>
<s> if industries will never support themselves then of course it is a misappropriation of the property of its citizens whenever a government takes a slice by taxation from productive industries and gives it to a less productive one to make up its deficiencies <\s>
<s> the only possible theory of protection to young industries is that if protected for a season the industries may soon grow strong and stand alone <\s>
<s> mill never contemplated anything else <\s>
<s> but the difficulty is constantly met with in putting this theory into practice that the industry once that it has learned to depend on the help of the state never reaches a stage when it is willing to give up the assistance of the duties <\s>
<s> dependence on legislation begets a want of self reliance and destroys the stimulus to progress and good management <\s>
<s> it is said    there has never been an instance in the history of the country where the representatives of such industries who have enjoyed protection for a long series of years have been willing to submit to a reduction of the tariff or have proposed it <\s>
<s> but on the contrary their demands for still higher and higher duties are insatiable and never intermitted    362 the question of fact as to whether or not the united states is indebted for its present manufacturing position to protection when our industries were young seems to be capable of answer and an answer which shows that protection was imposed generally after the industries got a foothold and that very little assistance was derived from the duties on imports 363 the following explanation by mr <\s>
<s> mill 364 of the meaning put upon his argument of protection to young industries by those who have applied it to the united states will be of no slight interest    the passage has been made use of to show the inapplicability of free trade to the united states and for similar purpose in the australian colonies erroneously in my opinion but certainly with more plausibility than can be the case in the united states for australia really is a new country whose capabilities for carrying on manufactures can not yet be said to have been tested but the manufacturing parts of the united statesnew england and pennsylvaniaare no longer new countries they have carried on manufactures on a large scale and with the benefit of high protecting duties for at least two generations their operatives have had full time to acquire the manufacturing skill in which those of england had preceded them there has been ample experience to prove that the alleged inability of their manufactures to compete in the american market with those of great britain does not arise merely from the more recent date of their establishment but from the fact that american labor and capital can in the present circumstances of america be employed with greater return and greater advantage to the national wealth in the production of other articles <\s>
<s> i have never for a moment recommended or countenanced any protecting industry except for the purpose of enabling the protected branch of industry in a very moderate time to become independent of protection <\s>
<s> that moderate time in the united states has been exceeded and if the cotton and iron of america still need protection against those of the other hemisphere it is in my eyes a complete proof that they aught not to have it and that the longer it is continued the greater the injustice and the waste of national resources will be    there is only one part of the protectionist scheme which requires any further notice its policy toward colonies and foreign dependencies that of compelling them to trade exclusively with the dominant country <\s>
<s> a country which thus secures to itself an extra foreign demand for its commodities undoubtedly gives itself some advantage in the distribution of the general gains of the commercial world <\s>
<s> since however it causes the industry and capital of the colony to be diverted from channels which are proved to be the most productive inasmuch as they are those into which industry and capital spontaneously tend to flow there is a loss on the whole to the productive powers of the world and the mother country does not gain so much as she makes the colony lose <\s>
<s> if therefore the mother country refuses to acknowledge any reciprocity of obligations she imposes a tribute on the colony in an indirect mode greatly more oppressive and injurious than the direct <\s>
<s>    on the ground of high wages <\s>
<s> the discussion by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes on the question of wages as affected by the tariff is such that i have quoted it as fully as possible    the position taken in the united states is that protection is only needed and only asked for where american industry is placed under a disadvantage as compared with the industry of foreign countries .... <\s>
<s> the rates of wages measured in money are higher in the united states than in europe and therefore it is argued the cost of producing commodities is higher .... <\s>
<s> the high rates of wages in the united states are not peculiar to any branch of industry but are universal throughout its whole range <\s>
<s> if therefore a high rate of wages proves a high cost of production and a high cost of production proves a need of protection it follows that the farmers of illinois and the cotton planters of the southern states stand in as much need of fostering legislation as the cotton spinners of new england or the iron masters of pennsylvania <\s>
<s> a criterion which leads to such results must i think be regarded as sufficiently condemned <\s>
<s> the fallacy is in truth ... <\s>
<s> that all industries are not in each country equally favored or disfavored by nature and have not therefore equal need of this protecting care <\s>
<s> if american protectionists are not prepared to demand protective duties in favor of the illinois farmer against the competition of his english rival they are bound to admit either that a high cost of production is not incompatible with effective competition or else that a high rate of wages does not prove a high cost of production and if this is not so in illinois then i wish to know why the case should be different in pennsylvania or in new england <\s>
<s> if a high rate of wages in the first of these states be consistent with a low cost of production why may not a high rate of wages in pennsylvania be consistent with a low cost of producing coal and iron <\s>
<s>    the rate of wages whether measured in money or in the real remuneration of the laborer affords an approximate criterion of the cost of production 365 either of money or of the commodities that enter into the laborers real remuneration but in a sense the inverse of that in which it is understood in the argument under consideration in other words a high rate of wages indicates not a high but a low cost of production 366 ... <\s>
<s> thus in the united states the rate of wages is high whether measured in gold or in the most important articles of the laborers consumptiona fact which proves that the cost of producing gold as well as that of producing those other commodities is low in the united states .... <\s>
<s> i would ask objectors to consider what are the true causes of the high remuneration of american industry <\s>
<s> it will surely be admitted that in the last resort these resolve themselves into the one great fact of its high productive power .... <\s>
<s> i must therefore contend that the high scale of industrial remuneration in america instead of being evidence of a high cost of production in that country is distinctly evidence of a low cost of productionof a low cost of production that is to say in the first place of gold and in the next of the commodities which mainly constitute the real wages of labora description which embraces at once the most important raw materials of industry and the most important articles of general consumption <\s>
<s> as regards commodities not included in this description the criterion of wages stands in no constant relation of any kind to their cost and is therefore simply irrelevant to the point at issue <\s>
<s> and now we may see what this claim for protection to american industry founded on the high scale of american remuneration really comes to it is a demand for special legislative aid in consideration of the possession of special industrial facilitiesa complaint in short against the exceptional bounty of nature <\s>
<s>    perhaps i shall here be asked how if the case be soif the high rate of industrial remuneration in america be only evidence of a low cost of productionthe fact is to be explained since fact it undoubtedly is that the people of the united states are unable to compete in neutral markets in the sale of certain important wares with england and other european countries 367 no one will say that the people of new england new york and pennsylvania are deficient in any industrial qualities possessed by the workmen of any country in the world <\s>
<s> how happens it then that enjoying industrial advantages superior to other countries they are yet unable to hold their own against them in the general markets of commerce <\s>
<s> i shall endeavor to meet this objection fairly and in the first place let me state what my contention is with regard to the cost of production in america <\s>
<s> i do not contend that it is low in the case of all commodities capable of being produced in the country but only in that of a large very important but still limited group <\s>
<s> with regard to commodities lying outside this group i hold that the rate of wages is simply no evidence as to the cost of their production one way or the other <\s>
<s> but secondly i beg the reader to consider what is meant by the alleged    inability    of new england and pennsylvania to compete let us say with manchester and sheffield in the manufacture of calico and cutlery <\s>
<s> what it means and what it only can mean is that they are unable to do so consistently with obtaining that rate of remuneration on their industry which is current in the united states <\s>
<s> if only american laborers and capitalists would be content with the wages and profits current in great britain there is nothing that i know of to prevent them from holding their own in any markets to which manchester and sheffield can send their wares <\s>
<s> and this brings us to the heart of the question <\s>
<s> over a large portion of the great field of industry the people of the united states enjoy as compared with those of europe 1 advantages of a very exceptional kind over the rest 2 the advantage is less decided or 3 they stand on a par with europeans or 4 possibly they are in some instances at a disadvantage <\s>
<s> engaging in the branches of industry in which their advantage over europe is great they reap industrial returns proportionally great and so long as they confine themselves to these occupations they can compete in neutral markets against all the world and still secure the high rewards accruing from their exceptionally rich resources <\s>
<s> but the people of the union decline to confine themselves within these liberal bounds <\s>
<s> they would cover the whole domain of industrial activity and think it hard that they should not reap the same rich harvests from every part of the field <\s>
<s> they must descend into the arena with sheffield and manchester and yet secure the rewards of chicago and st <\s>
<s> they must employ european conditions of production and obtain american results <\s>
<s> what is this but to quarrel with the laws of nature <\s>
<s> these laws have assigned to an extensive range of industries carried on in the united states a high scale of return far in excess of what europe can command to a few others a return on a scale not exceeding the european proportion <\s>
<s> american enterprise would engage in all departments alike and obtain upon all the high rewards which nature has assigned only to some <\s>
<s> here we find the real meaning of the    inability    of americans to compete with the    pauper labor    of europe <\s>
<s> they can not do so and at the same time secure the american rate of return on their work <\s>
<s> the inability no doubt exists but it is one created not by the drawbacks but by the exceptional advantages of their position <\s>
<s> it is as if a skilled artisan should complain that he could not compete with the hedger and ditcher <\s>
<s> let him only be content with the hedger and ditchers rate of pay and there will be nothing to prevent him from entering the lists even against this rival    368 it is often said that wages are kept at a high rate in the united states by the existence of protected industries <\s>
<s> on the other hand the truth is that the protected industries must pay the current high rate of wages fixed by the general productiveness of all industries in the country <\s>
<s> when the facts are investigated it is surprising how small a portion of the laborers of the united states are employed in occupations which owe their existence to the tariff <\s>
<s> a general view of the relative numbers engaged in different occupations may be seen by reference to chart no <\s>
<s> xxiv based on the returns for the census of 1880 <\s>
<s> the data are well worth examination :( 369 1 agriculture 7,670 493 2 manufacturing 3,837 112 mechanical and mining 3 trade and transportation 1,810 256 4 professional and personal 4,074 238 services all occupations 17,392 099 illustration chart xxiv chart xxiv <\s>
<s> chart showing for the united states in 1880 the ratio between the total population over ten years of age and the number of persons reported as engaged in each principal class of gainful occupations <\s>
<s> compiled from the returns of the tenth census by the editor note    the interior square represents the proportion of the population which is accounted for as engaged in gainful occupations <\s>
<s> the unshaded space between the inner and outer squares represents the proportion of the population not so accounted for <\s>
<s> of the second class less than 450,000 work people are engaged in the chief protected industriescotton woolen and iron and steel combined <\s>

<s> productive and unproductive consumption <\s>

<s> productive and unproductive consumption <\s>
<s> the distinction of productive and unproductive is applicable to consumption as well as to labor <\s>

<s> that alone is productive consumption which goes to maintain and increase the productive powers of the community either those residing in its soil in its materials in the number and efficiency of its instruments of production or in its people <\s>

<s> productive and unproductive consumption <\s>
<s> the distinction of productive and unproductive is applicable to consumption as well as to labor <\s>

<s> definition of productive and unproductive labor <\s>
<s> labor is indispensable to production but has not always production for its effect <\s>
<s> there is much labor and of a high order of usefulness of which production is not the object <\s>

<s> productive labor means labor productive of wealth <\s>
<s> we are recalled therefore to the question touched upon in our preliminary remarks what wealth is <\s>
<s> by unproductive labor on the contrary will be understood labor which does not terminate in the creation of material wealth <\s>
<s> and all labor according to our present definition must be classed as unproductive which terminates in a permanent benefit however important provided that an increase of material products forms no part of that benefit <\s>
<s> the labor of saving a friends life is not productive unless the friend is a productive laborer and produces more than he consumes <\s>
<s> the principle on which the distinction is made is perfectly clear but in many cases persons may be misled chiefly in regard to matters of fact <\s>
<s> a clergyman may at first sight be classed as an unproductive laborer but until we know the facts we can not apply the principle of our definition <\s>
<s> unless we know that no clergyman by inculcating rules of morality and self control ever caused an idler or wrong doer to become a steady laborer we can not say that a clergyman is a laborer unproductive of material wealth <\s>
<s> likewise the army or the officers of our government at washington may or may not have aided in producing material wealth according as they do or do not in fact accomplish the protective purposes for which they exist <\s>
<s> there is however no disparagement implied in the word unproductive it is merely an economic question and has to do only with forces affecting the production of wealth <\s>
<s> unproductive may be as useful as productive labor it may be more useful even in point of permanent advantage or its use may consist only in pleasurable sensation which when gone leaves no trace or it may not afford even this but may be absolute waste <\s>
<s> in any case society or mankind grow no richer by it but poorer <\s>
<s> all material products consumed by any one while he produces nothing are so much subtracted for the time from the material products which society would otherwise have possessed <\s>
<s> to be wasted however is a liability not confined to unproductive labor <\s>
<s> productive labor may equally be waste if more of it is expended than really conduces to production <\s>
<s> if defect of skill in laborers or of judgment in those who direct them causes a misapplication of productive industry labor is wasted <\s>
<s> productive labor may render a nation poorer if the wealth it produces that is the increase it makes in the stock of useful or agreeable things be of a kind not immediately wanted as when a commodity is unsalable because produced in a quantity beyond the present demand or when speculators build docks and warehouses before there is any trade <\s>
<s> productive and unproductive consumption <\s>
<s> the distinction of productive and unproductive is applicable to consumption as well as to labor <\s>
<s> all the members of the community are not laborers but all are consumers and consume either unproductively or productively <\s>

<s> the only productive consumers are productive laborers the labor of direction being of course included as well as that of execution <\s>

<s> there is unproductive consumption by productive consumers <\s>
<s> what they consume in keeping up or improving their health strength and capacities of work or in rearing other productive laborers to succeed them is productive consumption <\s>
<s> but consumption on pleasures or luxuries whether by the idle or by the industrious since production is neither its object nor is in any way advanced by it must be reckoned unproductive with a reservation perhaps of a certain quantum of enjoyment which may be classed among necessaries since anything short of it would not be consistent with the greatest efficiency of labor <\s>
<s> that alone is productive consumption which goes to maintain and increase the productive powers of the community either those residing in its soil in its materials in the number and efficiency of its instruments of production or in its people <\s>
<s> i grant that no labor really tends to the enrichment of society which is employed in producing things for the use of unproductive consumers <\s>
<s> the tailor who makes a coat for a man who produces nothing is a productive laborer but in a few weeks or months the coat is worn out while the wearer has not produced anything to replace it and the community is then no richer by the labor of the tailor than if the same sum had been paid for a stall at the opera <\s>

<s> we see however by this that there is a distinction more important to the wealth of a community than even that between productive and unproductive labor the distinction namely between labor for the supply of productive and for the supply of unproductive consumption between labor employed in keeping up or in adding to the productive resources of the country and that which is employed otherwise <\s>

<s> definition of productive and unproductive labor <\s>
<s> labor is indispensable to production but has not always production for its effect <\s>
<s> there is much labor and of a high order of usefulness of which production is not the object <\s>
<s> labor has accordingly been distinguished into productive and unproductive <\s>
<s> productive labor means labor productive of wealth <\s>
<s> we are recalled therefore to the question touched upon in our preliminary remarks what wealth is <\s>
<s> by unproductive labor on the contrary will be understood labor which does not terminate in the creation of material wealth <\s>
<s> and all labor according to our present definition must be classed as unproductive which terminates in a permanent benefit however important provided that an increase of material products forms no part of that benefit <\s>
<s> the labor of saving a friends life is not productive unless the friend is a productive laborer and produces more than he consumes <\s>
<s> the principle on which the distinction is made is perfectly clear but in many cases persons may be misled chiefly in regard to matters of fact <\s>
<s> a clergyman may at first sight be classed as an unproductive laborer but until we know the facts we can not apply the principle of our definition <\s>
<s> unless we know that no clergyman by inculcating rules of morality and self control ever caused an idler or wrong doer to become a steady laborer we can not say that a clergyman is a laborer unproductive of material wealth <\s>
<s> likewise the army or the officers of our government at washington may or may not have aided in producing material wealth according as they do or do not in fact accomplish the protective purposes for which they exist <\s>
<s> there is however no disparagement implied in the word unproductive it is merely an economic question and has to do only with forces affecting the production of wealth <\s>
<s> unproductive may be as useful as productive labor it may be more useful even in point of permanent advantage or its use may consist only in pleasurable sensation which when gone leaves no trace or it may not afford even this but may be absolute waste <\s>
<s> in any case society or mankind grow no richer by it but poorer <\s>
<s> all material products consumed by any one while he produces nothing are so much subtracted for the time from the material products which society would otherwise have possessed <\s>
<s> to be wasted however is a liability not confined to unproductive labor <\s>
<s> productive labor may equally be waste if more of it is expended than really conduces to production <\s>
<s> if defect of skill in laborers or of judgment in those who direct them causes a misapplication of productive industry labor is wasted <\s>
<s> productive labor may render a nation poorer if the wealth it produces that is the increase it makes in the stock of useful or agreeable things be of a kind not immediately wanted as when a commodity is unsalable because produced in a quantity beyond the present demand or when speculators build docks and warehouses before there is any trade <\s>
<s> productive and unproductive consumption <\s>
<s> the distinction of productive and unproductive is applicable to consumption as well as to labor <\s>
<s> all the members of the community are not laborers but all are consumers and consume either unproductively or productively <\s>
<s> whoever contributes nothing directly or indirectly to production is an unproductive consumer <\s>
<s> the only productive consumers are productive laborers the labor of direction being of course included as well as that of execution <\s>
<s> but the consumption even of productive laborers is not all of it productive consumption <\s>
<s> there is unproductive consumption by productive consumers <\s>
<s> what they consume in keeping up or improving their health strength and capacities of work or in rearing other productive laborers to succeed them is productive consumption <\s>
<s> but consumption on pleasures or luxuries whether by the idle or by the industrious since production is neither its object nor is in any way advanced by it must be reckoned unproductive with a reservation perhaps of a certain quantum of enjoyment which may be classed among necessaries since anything short of it would not be consistent with the greatest efficiency of labor <\s>
<s> that alone is productive consumption which goes to maintain and increase the productive powers of the community either those residing in its soil in its materials in the number and efficiency of its instruments of production or in its people <\s>
<s> i grant that no labor really tends to the enrichment of society which is employed in producing things for the use of unproductive consumers <\s>
<s> the tailor who makes a coat for a man who produces nothing is a productive laborer but in a few weeks or months the coat is worn out while the wearer has not produced anything to replace it and the community is then no richer by the labor of the tailor than if the same sum had been paid for a stall at the opera <\s>
<s> nevertheless society has been richer by the labor while the coat lasted <\s>
<s> these things also such as lace and pine apples are wealth until they have been consumed <\s>
<s> distinction between labor for the supply of productive consumption and labor for the supply of unproductive consumption <\s>
<s> we see however by this that there is a distinction more important to the wealth of a community than even that between productive and unproductive labor the distinction namely between labor for the supply of productive and for the supply of unproductive consumption between labor employed in keeping up or in adding to the productive resources of the country and that which is employed otherwise <\s>
<s> of the produce of the country a part only is destined to be consumed productively the remainder supplies the unproductive consumption of producers and the entire consumption of the unproductive class <\s>
<s> suppose that the proportion of the annual produce applied to the first purpose amounts to half then one half the productive laborers of the country are all that are employed in the operations on which the permanent wealth of the country depends <\s>
<s> the other half are occupied from year to year and from generation to generation in producing things which are consumed and disappear without return and whatever this half consume is as completely lost as to any permanent effect on the national resources as if it were consumed unproductively <\s>
<s> suppose that this second half of the laboring population ceased to work and that the government maintained them in idleness for a whole year the first half would suffice to produce as they had done before their own necessaries and the necessaries of the second half and to keep the stock of materials and implements undiminished the unproductive classes indeed would be either starved or obliged to produce their own subsistence and the whole community would be reduced during a year to bare necessaries but the sources of production would be unimpaired and the next year there would not necessarily be a smaller produce than if no such interval of inactivity had occurred while if the case had been reversed if the first half of the laborers had suspended their accustomed occupations and the second half had continued theirs the country at the end of the twelvemonth would have been entirely impoverished <\s>
<s> it would be a great error to regret the large proportion of the annual produce which in an opulent country goes to supply unproductive consumption <\s>
<s> that so great a surplus should be available for such purposes and that it should be applied to them can only be a subject of congratulation <\s>
<s> this principle may be seen by the following classification a idlers or unproductive laborerse g actors <\s>
<s> b productive laborerse g farmers <\s>
<s> c producing wealth for productive consumption one half the annual produce <\s>
<s> d producing wealth for unproductive consumption a one half the annual produce <\s>
<s> group d are productive laborers and their own necessaries are productively consumed but they are supplied by c who keep themselves and d in existence <\s>
<s> so long as c work both c and d can go on producing <\s>
<s> if d stopped working they could be still subsisted as before by c but a would be forced to produce for themselves <\s>
<s> but if c stopped working d and c would be left without the necessaries of life and would be obliged to cease their usual work <\s>
<s> in this way it may be seen how much more important to the increase of material wealth c are than d who labor    for the supply of unproductive consumption    of course group d are desirable on other than economic grounds because their labor represents what can be enjoyed beyond the necessities of life <\s>
<s> capital is wealth appropriated to reproductive employment <\s>
<s> it has been seen in the preceding chapters that besides the primary and universal requisites of production labor and natural agents there is another requisite without which no productive operations beyond the rude and scanty beginnings of primitive industry are possiblenamely a stock previously accumulated of the products of former labor <\s>
<s> this accumulated stock of the produce of labor is termed capital <\s>
<s> what capital does for production is to afford the shelter protection tools and materials which the work requires and to feed and otherwise maintain the laborers during the process <\s>
<s> these are the services which present labor requires from past and from the produce of past labor <\s>
<s> whatever things are destined for this usedestined to supply productive labor with these various prerequisitesare capital <\s>
<s> when there is more land wanted for cultivation than a place possesses or than it possesses of a certain quality and certain advantages of situation land of that quality and situation may be sold for a price or let for an annual rent <\s>
<s> the second requisite of production labor <\s>
<s> it is now our purpose to describe the second requisite of production labor and point out that it can be either direct or indirect <\s>
<s> this division and subdivision can be seen from the classification given below <\s>
<s> under the head of indirect labor are to be arranged all the many employments subsidiary to the production of any one article and which as they furnish but a small part of labor for the one article e g bread are subsidiary to the production of a vast number of other articles and hence we see the interdependence of one employment on another which comes out so conspicuously at the time of a commercial depression <\s>
<s>    we think it little to sit down to a table covered with articles from all quarters of the globe and from the remotest isles of the seawith tea from china coffee from brazil spices from the east and sugar from the west indies knives from sheffield made with iron from sweden and ivory from africa with silver from mexico and cotton from south carolina all being lighted with oil brought from new zealand or the arctic circle <\s>
<s> still less do we think of the great number of persons whose united agency is required to bring any one of these finished products to our homesof the merchants insurers sailors ship builders cordage and sail makers astronomical instrument makers men of science and others before a pound of tea can appear in our market    101 the labor 102 which terminates in the production of an article fitted for some human use is either employed directly about the thing or in previous operations destined to facilitate perhaps essential to the possibility of the subsequent ones <\s>
<s> in making bread for example the labor employed about the thing itself is that of the baker but the labor of the miller though employed directly in the production not of bread but of flour is equally part of the aggregate sum of labor by which the bread is produced as is also the labor of the sower and of the reaper <\s>
<s> some may think that all these persons ought to be considered as employing their labor directly about the thing the corn the flour and the bread being one substance in three different states <\s>
<s> without disputing about this question of mere language there is still the plowman who prepared the ground for the seed and whose labor never came in contact with the substance in any of its states and the plow maker whose share in the result was still more remote <\s>
<s> we must add yet another kind of labor that of transporting the produce from the place of its production to the place of its destined use the labor of carrying the corn to market and from market to the millers the flour from the millers to the bakers and the bread from the bakers to the place of its final consumption <\s>
<s> besides the two classes of indirect laborers here mentioned those engaged in producing materials and those in transportation there are several others who are paid fractions out of the bread <\s>
<s> subsidiary to the direct labor of the bread maker is the labor of all those who make the instruments employed in the process as e g the oven <\s>
<s> materials are completely changed in character by one use as when the coal is burned or the flour baked into bread while an instrument like an oven is capable of remaining intact throughout many operations <\s>
<s> the producer of materials and the transporter are paid by the bread maker in the price of his coal and flour when left at his door so that the price of the loaf is influenced by these payments <\s>
<s> those persons moreover who like the police and officers of our government act to protect property and life are also to be classed as laborers indirectly aiding in the production of the given article bread and by his taxes the bread maker helps pay the wages of these officials <\s>
<s> shading off into a more distant although essential connection is another classthat of those laborers who train human beings in the branches of knowledge necessary to the attainment of proper skill in managing the processes and instruments of an industry <\s>
<s> the acquisition of the rudiments of education and in many cases the most profound knowledge of chemistry physics and recondite studies are essential to production and teachers are indirect laborers in producing almost every article in the market <\s>
<s> in this country especially are inventors a class of indirect laborers essential to all ultimate production as it now goes on <\s>
<s> the improvements in the instruments of production are the results of an inventive ability which has made american machinery known all over the world <\s>
<s> they too as well as the teacher are paid a small fraction of course out of the ultimate result by an indirect path and materially change the ease or difficulty cheapness or dearness of production in nearly every branch of industry <\s>
<s> in the particular illustration given they have improved the ovens ranges and stoves so that the same or better articles are produced at a less cost than formerly <\s>
<s> all these indirect laborers receive in the way of remuneration a fraction some more some less the farther they are removed from the direct process of the value of the final result <\s>
<s> of capital as a requisite of production <\s>
<s> but another set of laborers are to be placed in distinct contrast with these so far as the grounds on which they receive their remuneration is concerned <\s>
<s> these are the men engaged previously in providing the subsistence and articles by which the former classes of labor can carry on their operations <\s>
<s> the previous employment of labor is an indispensable condition to every productive operation on any other than the very smallest scale <\s>
<s> except the labor of the hunter and fisher there is scarcely any kind of labor to which the returns are immediate <\s>
<s> productive operations require to be continued a certain time before their fruits are obtained <\s>
<s> unless the laborer before commencing his work possesses a store of food or can obtain access to the stores of some one else in sufficient quantity to maintain him until the production is completed he can undertake no labor but such as can be carried on at odd intervals concurrently with the pursuit of his subsistence <\s>
<s> the possession of capital is thus a third requisite of production together with land and labor as noted above <\s>
<s> henry george    progress and poverty    chap <\s>
<s> iv holds an opposite opinion    the subsistence of the laborers who built the pyramids was drawn not from a previously hoarded stock    does he not forget the story of josephs store of corn    but from the constantly recurring crops of the nile valley    he can not obtain food itself in any abundance for every mode of so obtaining it requires that there be already food in store <\s>
<s> agriculture only brings forth food after the lapse of months and though the labors of the agriculturist are not necessarily continuous during the whole period they must occupy a considerable part of it <\s>
<s> not only is agriculture impossible without food produced in advance but there must be a very great quantity in advance to enable any considerable community to support itself wholly by agriculture <\s>
<s> a country like england or the united states is only able to carry on the agriculture of the present year because that of past years has provided in those countries or somewhere else sufficient food to support their agricultural population until the next harvest <\s>
<s> they are only enabled to produce so many other things besides food because the food which was in store at the close of the last harvest suffices to maintain not only the agricultural laborers but a large industrious population besides <\s>
<s> the claim to remuneration founded on the possession of food available for the maintenance of laborers is of another kind remuneration for abstinence not for labor <\s>
<s> if a person has a store of food he has it in his power to consume it himself in idleness or in feeding others to attend on him or to fight for him or to sing or dance for him <\s>
<s> if instead of these things he gives it to productive laborers to support them during their work he can and naturally will claim a remuneration from the produce <\s>
<s> he will not be content with simple repayment if he receives merely that he is only in the same situation as at first and has derived no advantage from delaying to apply his savings to his own benefit or pleasure <\s>
<s> he will look for some equivalent for this forbearance :( 103 he will expect his advance of food to come back to him with an increase called in the language of business a profit and the hope of this profit will generally have been a part of the inducement which made him accumulate a stock by economizing in his own consumption or at any rate which made him forego the application of it when accumulated to his personal ease or satisfaction <\s>

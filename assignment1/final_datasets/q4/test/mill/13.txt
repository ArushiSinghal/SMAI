<s> values of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>
<s> but when the demand for both is such as to require that each should be grown not only on the soils peculiarly fitted for it but on the medium soils which without being specifically adapted to either are about equally suited for both the cost of production on those medium soils will determine the relative value of the two grains while the rent of the soils specifically adapted to each will be regulated by their productive power considered with reference to that one grain alone to which they are peculiarly applicable <\s>
<s> thus far the question presents no difficulty to any one to whom the general principles of value are familiar <\s>
<s> illustration agricultural produce this may be easily shown by a diagram in which a represents the grade of land best adapted for oats b c d respectively lands of diminishing productiveness for oats until e is reached which is perhaps equally good for oats or wheat a b c d and e likewise represent the wheat lands the best beginning with a <\s>
<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>

<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>
<s> running downward through e with c <\s>
<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>

<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>

<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>

<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>
<s> running downward through e with c <\s>
<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>

<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>
<s> but when the demand for both is such as to require that each should be grown not only on the soils peculiarly fitted for it but on the medium soils which without being specifically adapted to either are about equally suited for both the cost of production on those medium soils will determine the relative value of the two grains while the rent of the soils specifically adapted to each will be regulated by their productive power considered with reference to that one grain alone to which they are peculiarly applicable <\s>
<s> thus far the question presents no difficulty to any one to whom the general principles of value are familiar <\s>
<s> illustration agricultural produce this may be easily shown by a diagram in which a represents the grade of land best adapted for oats b c d respectively lands of diminishing productiveness for oats until e is reached which is perhaps equally good for oats or wheat a b c d and e likewise represent the wheat lands the best beginning with a <\s>
<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>
<s> so if all the wheat lands are cultivated land a or b is compared with e but in regard to the capacity of e to produce wheat <\s>
<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>
<s> running downward through e with c <\s>
<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>

<s> the explanation which would be popularly given of this would be that it is cheaper to import than to produce them and this is the true reason <\s>

<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>

<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>

<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>

<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>

<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>

<s> the demand consequently contracting the production will be somewhat reduced and prices will become stationary when by the joint effect of the rise of gas and the fall of coke so much less of the first is sold and so much more of the second that there is now a market for all the coke which results from the existing extent of the gas manufacture <\s>

<s> values of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>

<s> thus far the question presents no difficulty to any one to whom the general principles of value are familiar <\s>
<s> illustration agricultural produce this may be easily shown by a diagram in which a represents the grade of land best adapted for oats b c d respectively lands of diminishing productiveness for oats until e is reached which is perhaps equally good for oats or wheat a b c d and e likewise represent the wheat lands the best beginning with a <\s>
<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>

<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>
<s> running downward through e with c <\s>
<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>

<s> the explanation which would be popularly given of this would be that it is cheaper to import than to produce them and this is the true reason <\s>

<s> are things never imported but from places where they can be produced with less labor or less of the other element of cost time than in the place to which they are brought <\s>
<s> does the law that permanent value is proportioned to cost of production hold good between commodities produced in distant places as it does between those produced in adjacent places <\s>
<s> we shall find that it does not <\s>
<s> a thing may sometimes be sold cheapest by being produced in some other place than that at which it can be produced with the smallest amount of labor and abstinence <\s>

<s> to illustrate the cases in which interchange of commodities will not and those in which it will take place between two countries the supposition may be made that the united states has an advantage over england in the production both of iron and of corn <\s>

<s> the demand consequently contracting the production will be somewhat reduced and prices will become stationary when by the joint effect of the rise of gas and the fall of coke so much less of the first is sold and so much more of the second that there is now a market for all the coke which results from the existing extent of the gas manufacture <\s>

<s> values of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>
<s> but when the demand for both is such as to require that each should be grown not only on the soils peculiarly fitted for it but on the medium soils which without being specifically adapted to either are about equally suited for both the cost of production on those medium soils will determine the relative value of the two grains while the rent of the soils specifically adapted to each will be regulated by their productive power considered with reference to that one grain alone to which they are peculiarly applicable <\s>
<s> thus far the question presents no difficulty to any one to whom the general principles of value are familiar <\s>
<s> illustration agricultural produce this may be easily shown by a diagram in which a represents the grade of land best adapted for oats b c d respectively lands of diminishing productiveness for oats until e is reached which is perhaps equally good for oats or wheat a b c d and e likewise represent the wheat lands the best beginning with a <\s>
<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>
<s> so if all the wheat lands are cultivated land a or b is compared with e but in regard to the capacity of e to produce wheat <\s>
<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>
<s> running downward through e with c <\s>
<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>

<s> the explanation which would be popularly given of this would be that it is cheaper to import than to produce them and this is the true reason <\s>

<s> are things never imported but from places where they can be produced with less labor or less of the other element of cost time than in the place to which they are brought <\s>
<s> does the law that permanent value is proportioned to cost of production hold good between commodities produced in distant places as it does between those produced in adjacent places <\s>
<s> we shall find that it does not <\s>
<s> a thing may sometimes be sold cheapest by being produced in some other place than that at which it can be produced with the smallest amount of labor and abstinence <\s>

<s> but between distant places and especially between different countries profits may continue different because persons do not usually remove themselves or their capitals to a distant place without a very strong motive <\s>

<s> a tendency may even now be observed toward such a state of things capital is becoming more and more cosmopolitan there is so much greater similarity of manners and institutions than formerly and so much less alienation of feeling among the more civilized countries that both population and capital now move from one of those countries to another on much less temptation than heretofore <\s>

<s> so that england also got her iron at an advantage over sweden of one half of ten days    labor and yet england had an absolute advantage over sweden in iron of a less amount i e of one fourth of twelve days    labor <\s>
<s> it is to be distinctly understood that by difference in comparative cost we mean a difference in the comparative cost of producing two or more articles in the same country and not the difference of cost of the same article in the different trading countries <\s>

<s> to illustrate the cases in which interchange of commodities will not and those in which it will take place between two countries the supposition may be made that the united states has an advantage over england in the production both of iron and of corn <\s>
<s> it may first be supposed that the advantage is of equal amount in both commodities the iron and the corn each of which required 100 days    labor in the united states requiring each 150 days    labor in england <\s>
<s> it would follow that the iron of 150 days    labor in england if sent to the united states would be equal to the iron of 100 days    labor in the united states if exchanged for corn therefore it would exchange for the corn of only 100 days    labor <\s>

<s> there are not a few instances of commodities thus associated in their production <\s>
<s> for example coke and coal gas are both produced from the same material and by the same operation <\s>
<s> in a more partial sense mutton and wool are an example beef hides and tallow calves and dairy produce chickens and eggs <\s>
<s> cost of production can have nothing to do with deciding the value of the associated commodities relatively to each other <\s>
<s> it only decides their joint value <\s>
<s> cost of production does not determine their prices but the sum of their prices <\s>
<s> a principle is wanting to apportion the expenses of production between the two <\s>
<s> since cost of production here fails us we must revert to a law of value anterior to cost of production and more fundamental the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> the law is that the demand for a commodity varies with its value and that the value adjusts itself so that the demand shall be equal to the supply <\s>
<s> this supplies the principle of repartition which we are in quest of <\s>
<s> suppose that a certain quantity of gas is produced and sold at a certain price and that the residuum of coke is offered at a price which together with that of the gas repays the expenses with the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> suppose too that at the price put upon the gas and coke respectively the whole of the gas finds an easy market without either surplus or deficiency but that purchasers can not be found for all the coke corresponding to it <\s>
<s> the coke will be offered at a lower price in order to force a market <\s>
<s> but this lower price together with the price of the gas will not be remunerating the manufacture as a whole will not pay its expenses with the ordinary profit and will not on these terms continue to be carried on <\s>
<s> the gas therefore must be sold at a higher price to make up for the deficiency on the coke <\s>
<s> the demand consequently contracting the production will be somewhat reduced and prices will become stationary when by the joint effect of the rise of gas and the fall of coke so much less of the first is sold and so much more of the second that there is now a market for all the coke which results from the existing extent of the gas manufacture <\s>
<s> or suppose the reverse case that more coke is wanted at the present prices than can be supplied by the operations required by the existing demand for gas <\s>
<s> coke being now in deficiency will rise in price <\s>

<s> the unsatisfied demand for coke will be supplied but this can not be done without increasing the supply of gas too and as the existing demand was fully supplied already an increased quantity can only find a market by lowering the price <\s>
<s> equilibrium will be attained when the demand for each article fits so well with the demand for the other that the quantity required of each is exactly as much as is generated in producing the quantity required of the other <\s>

<s> values of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>
<s> but when the demand for both is such as to require that each should be grown not only on the soils peculiarly fitted for it but on the medium soils which without being specifically adapted to either are about equally suited for both the cost of production on those medium soils will determine the relative value of the two grains while the rent of the soils specifically adapted to each will be regulated by their productive power considered with reference to that one grain alone to which they are peculiarly applicable <\s>
<s> thus far the question presents no difficulty to any one to whom the general principles of value are familiar <\s>
<s> illustration agricultural produce this may be easily shown by a diagram in which a represents the grade of land best adapted for oats b c d respectively lands of diminishing productiveness for oats until e is reached which is perhaps equally good for oats or wheat a b c d and e likewise represent the wheat lands the best beginning with a <\s>
<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>
<s> so if all the wheat lands are cultivated land a or b is compared with e but in regard to the capacity of e to produce wheat <\s>
<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>
<s> running downward through e with c <\s>
<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>
<s> here then we obtain a fresh illustration in a somewhat different manner of the operation of demand not as an occasional disturber of value but as a permanent regulator of it conjoined with or supplementary to cost of production <\s>
<s> cost of production not a regulator of international values <\s>
<s> extension of the word    international    some things it is physically impossible to produce except in particular circumstances of heat soil water or atmosphere <\s>

<s> the explanation which would be popularly given of this would be that it is cheaper to import than to produce them and this is the true reason <\s>

<s> are things never imported but from places where they can be produced with less labor or less of the other element of cost time than in the place to which they are brought <\s>
<s> does the law that permanent value is proportioned to cost of production hold good between commodities produced in distant places as it does between those produced in adjacent places <\s>

<s> a tendency may even now be observed toward such a state of things capital is becoming more and more cosmopolitan there is so much greater similarity of manners and institutions than formerly and so much less alienation of feeling among the more civilized countries that both population and capital now move from one of those countries to another on much less temptation than heretofore <\s>

<s> to illustrate the cases in which interchange of commodities will not and those in which it will take place between two countries the supposition may be made that the united states has an advantage over england in the production both of iron and of corn <\s>
<s> it may first be supposed that the advantage is of equal amount in both commodities the iron and the corn each of which required 100 days    labor in the united states requiring each 150 days    labor in england <\s>

<s> there are not a few instances of commodities thus associated in their production <\s>
<s> for example coke and coal gas are both produced from the same material and by the same operation <\s>
<s> in a more partial sense mutton and wool are an example beef hides and tallow calves and dairy produce chickens and eggs <\s>

<s> it only decides their joint value <\s>
<s> cost of production does not determine their prices but the sum of their prices <\s>
<s> a principle is wanting to apportion the expenses of production between the two <\s>
<s> since cost of production here fails us we must revert to a law of value anterior to cost of production and more fundamental the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> the law is that the demand for a commodity varies with its value and that the value adjusts itself so that the demand shall be equal to the supply <\s>
<s> this supplies the principle of repartition which we are in quest of <\s>
<s> suppose that a certain quantity of gas is produced and sold at a certain price and that the residuum of coke is offered at a price which together with that of the gas repays the expenses with the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> suppose too that at the price put upon the gas and coke respectively the whole of the gas finds an easy market without either surplus or deficiency but that purchasers can not be found for all the coke corresponding to it <\s>
<s> the coke will be offered at a lower price in order to force a market <\s>
<s> but this lower price together with the price of the gas will not be remunerating the manufacture as a whole will not pay its expenses with the ordinary profit and will not on these terms continue to be carried on <\s>
<s> the gas therefore must be sold at a higher price to make up for the deficiency on the coke <\s>
<s> the demand consequently contracting the production will be somewhat reduced and prices will become stationary when by the joint effect of the rise of gas and the fall of coke so much less of the first is sold and so much more of the second that there is now a market for all the coke which results from the existing extent of the gas manufacture <\s>
<s> or suppose the reverse case that more coke is wanted at the present prices than can be supplied by the operations required by the existing demand for gas <\s>
<s> coke being now in deficiency will rise in price <\s>
<s> the whole operation will yield more than the usual rate of profit and additional capital will be attracted to the manufacture <\s>
<s> the unsatisfied demand for coke will be supplied but this can not be done without increasing the supply of gas too and as the existing demand was fully supplied already an increased quantity can only find a market by lowering the price <\s>
<s> equilibrium will be attained when the demand for each article fits so well with the demand for the other that the quantity required of each is exactly as much as is generated in producing the quantity required of the other <\s>

<s> values of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>
<s> but when the demand for both is such as to require that each should be grown not only on the soils peculiarly fitted for it but on the medium soils which without being specifically adapted to either are about equally suited for both the cost of production on those medium soils will determine the relative value of the two grains while the rent of the soils specifically adapted to each will be regulated by their productive power considered with reference to that one grain alone to which they are peculiarly applicable <\s>
<s> thus far the question presents no difficulty to any one to whom the general principles of value are familiar <\s>
<s> illustration agricultural produce this may be easily shown by a diagram in which a represents the grade of land best adapted for oats b c d respectively lands of diminishing productiveness for oats until e is reached which is perhaps equally good for oats or wheat a b c d and e likewise represent the wheat lands the best beginning with a <\s>
<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>
<s> so if all the wheat lands are cultivated land a or b is compared with e but in regard to the capacity of e to produce wheat <\s>
<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>
<s> running downward through e with c <\s>
<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>
<s> here then we obtain a fresh illustration in a somewhat different manner of the operation of demand not as an occasional disturber of value but as a permanent regulator of it conjoined with or supplementary to cost of production <\s>
<s> cost of production not a regulator of international values <\s>
<s> extension of the word    international    some things it is physically impossible to produce except in particular circumstances of heat soil water or atmosphere <\s>

<s> the explanation which would be popularly given of this would be that it is cheaper to import than to produce them and this is the true reason <\s>

<s> are things never imported but from places where they can be produced with less labor or less of the other element of cost time than in the place to which they are brought <\s>
<s> does the law that permanent value is proportioned to cost of production hold good between commodities produced in distant places as it does between those produced in adjacent places <\s>
<s> we shall find that it does not <\s>
<s> a thing may sometimes be sold cheapest by being produced in some other place than that at which it can be produced with the smallest amount of labor and abstinence <\s>

<s> but between distant places and especially between different countries profits may continue different because persons do not usually remove themselves or their capitals to a distant place without a very strong motive <\s>

<s> a tendency may even now be observed toward such a state of things capital is becoming more and more cosmopolitan there is so much greater similarity of manners and institutions than formerly and so much less alienation of feeling among the more civilized countries that both population and capital now move from one of those countries to another on much less temptation than heretofore <\s>
<s> but there are still extraordinary differences both of wages and of profits between different parts of the world <\s>

<s> it might seem that a special theory of value is required for international trade as compared with domestic trade for the particular reason that in the former there exists no free movement of labor and capital from one trading country to another <\s>

<s> the demand consequently contracting the production will be somewhat reduced and prices will become stationary when by the joint effect of the rise of gas and the fall of coke so much less of the first is sold and so much more of the second that there is now a market for all the coke which results from the existing extent of the gas manufacture <\s>

<s> values of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>
<s> but when the demand for both is such as to require that each should be grown not only on the soils peculiarly fitted for it but on the medium soils which without being specifically adapted to either are about equally suited for both the cost of production on those medium soils will determine the relative value of the two grains while the rent of the soils specifically adapted to each will be regulated by their productive power considered with reference to that one grain alone to which they are peculiarly applicable <\s>
<s> thus far the question presents no difficulty to any one to whom the general principles of value are familiar <\s>
<s> illustration agricultural produce this may be easily shown by a diagram in which a represents the grade of land best adapted for oats b c d respectively lands of diminishing productiveness for oats until e is reached which is perhaps equally good for oats or wheat a b c d and e likewise represent the wheat lands the best beginning with a <\s>
<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>

<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>
<s> running downward through e with c <\s>
<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>

<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>

<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>
<s> but when the demand for both is such as to require that each should be grown not only on the soils peculiarly fitted for it but on the medium soils which without being specifically adapted to either are about equally suited for both the cost of production on those medium soils will determine the relative value of the two grains while the rent of the soils specifically adapted to each will be regulated by their productive power considered with reference to that one grain alone to which they are peculiarly applicable <\s>

<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>

<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>

<s> to illustrate the cases in which interchange of commodities will not and those in which it will take place between two countries the supposition may be made that the united states has an advantage over england in the production both of iron and of corn <\s>

<s> there are not a few instances of commodities thus associated in their production <\s>
<s> for example coke and coal gas are both produced from the same material and by the same operation <\s>
<s> in a more partial sense mutton and wool are an example beef hides and tallow calves and dairy produce chickens and eggs <\s>
<s> cost of production can have nothing to do with deciding the value of the associated commodities relatively to each other <\s>
<s> it only decides their joint value <\s>
<s> cost of production does not determine their prices but the sum of their prices <\s>
<s> a principle is wanting to apportion the expenses of production between the two <\s>
<s> since cost of production here fails us we must revert to a law of value anterior to cost of production and more fundamental the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> the law is that the demand for a commodity varies with its value and that the value adjusts itself so that the demand shall be equal to the supply <\s>
<s> this supplies the principle of repartition which we are in quest of <\s>
<s> suppose that a certain quantity of gas is produced and sold at a certain price and that the residuum of coke is offered at a price which together with that of the gas repays the expenses with the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> suppose too that at the price put upon the gas and coke respectively the whole of the gas finds an easy market without either surplus or deficiency but that purchasers can not be found for all the coke corresponding to it <\s>

<s> but this lower price together with the price of the gas will not be remunerating the manufacture as a whole will not pay its expenses with the ordinary profit and will not on these terms continue to be carried on <\s>
<s> the gas therefore must be sold at a higher price to make up for the deficiency on the coke <\s>
<s> the demand consequently contracting the production will be somewhat reduced and prices will become stationary when by the joint effect of the rise of gas and the fall of coke so much less of the first is sold and so much more of the second that there is now a market for all the coke which results from the existing extent of the gas manufacture <\s>
<s> or suppose the reverse case that more coke is wanted at the present prices than can be supplied by the operations required by the existing demand for gas <\s>

<s> the unsatisfied demand for coke will be supplied but this can not be done without increasing the supply of gas too and as the existing demand was fully supplied already an increased quantity can only find a market by lowering the price <\s>
<s> equilibrium will be attained when the demand for each article fits so well with the demand for the other that the quantity required of each is exactly as much as is generated in producing the quantity required of the other <\s>

<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>

<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>

<s> there are not a few instances of commodities thus associated in their production <\s>
<s> for example coke and coal gas are both produced from the same material and by the same operation <\s>

<s> values of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>

<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>

<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>

<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>

<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>

<s> the demand consequently contracting the production will be somewhat reduced and prices will become stationary when by the joint effect of the rise of gas and the fall of coke so much less of the first is sold and so much more of the second that there is now a market for all the coke which results from the existing extent of the gas manufacture <\s>

<s> values of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>

<s> thus far the question presents no difficulty to any one to whom the general principles of value are familiar <\s>
<s> illustration agricultural produce this may be easily shown by a diagram in which a represents the grade of land best adapted for oats b c d respectively lands of diminishing productiveness for oats until e is reached which is perhaps equally good for oats or wheat a b c d and e likewise represent the wheat lands the best beginning with a <\s>
<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>

<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>
<s> running downward through e with c <\s>
<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>

<s> the explanation which would be popularly given of this would be that it is cheaper to import than to produce them and this is the true reason <\s>

<s> are things never imported but from places where they can be produced with less labor or less of the other element of cost time than in the place to which they are brought <\s>
<s> does the law that permanent value is proportioned to cost of production hold good between commodities produced in distant places as it does between those produced in adjacent places <\s>
<s> we shall find that it does not <\s>
<s> a thing may sometimes be sold cheapest by being produced in some other place than that at which it can be produced with the smallest amount of labor and abstinence <\s>

<s> to illustrate the cases in which interchange of commodities will not and those in which it will take place between two countries the supposition may be made that the united states has an advantage over england in the production both of iron and of corn <\s>

<s> the demand consequently contracting the production will be somewhat reduced and prices will become stationary when by the joint effect of the rise of gas and the fall of coke so much less of the first is sold and so much more of the second that there is now a market for all the coke which results from the existing extent of the gas manufacture <\s>

<s> values of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>
<s> but when the demand for both is such as to require that each should be grown not only on the soils peculiarly fitted for it but on the medium soils which without being specifically adapted to either are about equally suited for both the cost of production on those medium soils will determine the relative value of the two grains while the rent of the soils specifically adapted to each will be regulated by their productive power considered with reference to that one grain alone to which they are peculiarly applicable <\s>
<s> thus far the question presents no difficulty to any one to whom the general principles of value are familiar <\s>
<s> illustration agricultural produce this may be easily shown by a diagram in which a represents the grade of land best adapted for oats b c d respectively lands of diminishing productiveness for oats until e is reached which is perhaps equally good for oats or wheat a b c d and e likewise represent the wheat lands the best beginning with a <\s>
<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>
<s> so if all the wheat lands are cultivated land a or b is compared with e but in regard to the capacity of e to produce wheat <\s>
<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>
<s> running downward through e with c <\s>
<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>

<s> the explanation which would be popularly given of this would be that it is cheaper to import than to produce them and this is the true reason <\s>

<s> are things never imported but from places where they can be produced with less labor or less of the other element of cost time than in the place to which they are brought <\s>
<s> does the law that permanent value is proportioned to cost of production hold good between commodities produced in distant places as it does between those produced in adjacent places <\s>
<s> we shall find that it does not <\s>
<s> a thing may sometimes be sold cheapest by being produced in some other place than that at which it can be produced with the smallest amount of labor and abstinence <\s>

<s> but between distant places and especially between different countries profits may continue different because persons do not usually remove themselves or their capitals to a distant place without a very strong motive <\s>

<s> a tendency may even now be observed toward such a state of things capital is becoming more and more cosmopolitan there is so much greater similarity of manners and institutions than formerly and so much less alienation of feeling among the more civilized countries that both population and capital now move from one of those countries to another on much less temptation than heretofore <\s>

<s> so that england also got her iron at an advantage over sweden of one half of ten days    labor and yet england had an absolute advantage over sweden in iron of a less amount i e of one fourth of twelve days    labor <\s>
<s> it is to be distinctly understood that by difference in comparative cost we mean a difference in the comparative cost of producing two or more articles in the same country and not the difference of cost of the same article in the different trading countries <\s>

<s> to illustrate the cases in which interchange of commodities will not and those in which it will take place between two countries the supposition may be made that the united states has an advantage over england in the production both of iron and of corn <\s>
<s> it may first be supposed that the advantage is of equal amount in both commodities the iron and the corn each of which required 100 days    labor in the united states requiring each 150 days    labor in england <\s>
<s> it would follow that the iron of 150 days    labor in england if sent to the united states would be equal to the iron of 100 days    labor in the united states if exchanged for corn therefore it would exchange for the corn of only 100 days    labor <\s>

<s> there are not a few instances of commodities thus associated in their production <\s>
<s> for example coke and coal gas are both produced from the same material and by the same operation <\s>
<s> in a more partial sense mutton and wool are an example beef hides and tallow calves and dairy produce chickens and eggs <\s>
<s> cost of production can have nothing to do with deciding the value of the associated commodities relatively to each other <\s>
<s> it only decides their joint value <\s>
<s> cost of production does not determine their prices but the sum of their prices <\s>
<s> a principle is wanting to apportion the expenses of production between the two <\s>
<s> since cost of production here fails us we must revert to a law of value anterior to cost of production and more fundamental the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> the law is that the demand for a commodity varies with its value and that the value adjusts itself so that the demand shall be equal to the supply <\s>
<s> this supplies the principle of repartition which we are in quest of <\s>
<s> suppose that a certain quantity of gas is produced and sold at a certain price and that the residuum of coke is offered at a price which together with that of the gas repays the expenses with the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> suppose too that at the price put upon the gas and coke respectively the whole of the gas finds an easy market without either surplus or deficiency but that purchasers can not be found for all the coke corresponding to it <\s>
<s> the coke will be offered at a lower price in order to force a market <\s>
<s> but this lower price together with the price of the gas will not be remunerating the manufacture as a whole will not pay its expenses with the ordinary profit and will not on these terms continue to be carried on <\s>
<s> the gas therefore must be sold at a higher price to make up for the deficiency on the coke <\s>
<s> the demand consequently contracting the production will be somewhat reduced and prices will become stationary when by the joint effect of the rise of gas and the fall of coke so much less of the first is sold and so much more of the second that there is now a market for all the coke which results from the existing extent of the gas manufacture <\s>
<s> or suppose the reverse case that more coke is wanted at the present prices than can be supplied by the operations required by the existing demand for gas <\s>
<s> coke being now in deficiency will rise in price <\s>

<s> the unsatisfied demand for coke will be supplied but this can not be done without increasing the supply of gas too and as the existing demand was fully supplied already an increased quantity can only find a market by lowering the price <\s>
<s> equilibrium will be attained when the demand for each article fits so well with the demand for the other that the quantity required of each is exactly as much as is generated in producing the quantity required of the other <\s>

<s> values of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>
<s> but when the demand for both is such as to require that each should be grown not only on the soils peculiarly fitted for it but on the medium soils which without being specifically adapted to either are about equally suited for both the cost of production on those medium soils will determine the relative value of the two grains while the rent of the soils specifically adapted to each will be regulated by their productive power considered with reference to that one grain alone to which they are peculiarly applicable <\s>
<s> thus far the question presents no difficulty to any one to whom the general principles of value are familiar <\s>
<s> illustration agricultural produce this may be easily shown by a diagram in which a represents the grade of land best adapted for oats b c d respectively lands of diminishing productiveness for oats until e is reached which is perhaps equally good for oats or wheat a b c d and e likewise represent the wheat lands the best beginning with a <\s>
<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>
<s> so if all the wheat lands are cultivated land a or b is compared with e but in regard to the capacity of e to produce wheat <\s>
<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>
<s> running downward through e with c <\s>
<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>
<s> here then we obtain a fresh illustration in a somewhat different manner of the operation of demand not as an occasional disturber of value but as a permanent regulator of it conjoined with or supplementary to cost of production <\s>
<s> cost of production not a regulator of international values <\s>
<s> extension of the word    international    some things it is physically impossible to produce except in particular circumstances of heat soil water or atmosphere <\s>

<s> the explanation which would be popularly given of this would be that it is cheaper to import than to produce them and this is the true reason <\s>

<s> are things never imported but from places where they can be produced with less labor or less of the other element of cost time than in the place to which they are brought <\s>
<s> does the law that permanent value is proportioned to cost of production hold good between commodities produced in distant places as it does between those produced in adjacent places <\s>

<s> a tendency may even now be observed toward such a state of things capital is becoming more and more cosmopolitan there is so much greater similarity of manners and institutions than formerly and so much less alienation of feeling among the more civilized countries that both population and capital now move from one of those countries to another on much less temptation than heretofore <\s>

<s> to illustrate the cases in which interchange of commodities will not and those in which it will take place between two countries the supposition may be made that the united states has an advantage over england in the production both of iron and of corn <\s>
<s> it may first be supposed that the advantage is of equal amount in both commodities the iron and the corn each of which required 100 days    labor in the united states requiring each 150 days    labor in england <\s>

<s> there are not a few instances of commodities thus associated in their production <\s>
<s> for example coke and coal gas are both produced from the same material and by the same operation <\s>
<s> in a more partial sense mutton and wool are an example beef hides and tallow calves and dairy produce chickens and eggs <\s>

<s> it only decides their joint value <\s>
<s> cost of production does not determine their prices but the sum of their prices <\s>
<s> a principle is wanting to apportion the expenses of production between the two <\s>
<s> since cost of production here fails us we must revert to a law of value anterior to cost of production and more fundamental the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> the law is that the demand for a commodity varies with its value and that the value adjusts itself so that the demand shall be equal to the supply <\s>
<s> this supplies the principle of repartition which we are in quest of <\s>
<s> suppose that a certain quantity of gas is produced and sold at a certain price and that the residuum of coke is offered at a price which together with that of the gas repays the expenses with the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> suppose too that at the price put upon the gas and coke respectively the whole of the gas finds an easy market without either surplus or deficiency but that purchasers can not be found for all the coke corresponding to it <\s>
<s> the coke will be offered at a lower price in order to force a market <\s>
<s> but this lower price together with the price of the gas will not be remunerating the manufacture as a whole will not pay its expenses with the ordinary profit and will not on these terms continue to be carried on <\s>
<s> the gas therefore must be sold at a higher price to make up for the deficiency on the coke <\s>
<s> the demand consequently contracting the production will be somewhat reduced and prices will become stationary when by the joint effect of the rise of gas and the fall of coke so much less of the first is sold and so much more of the second that there is now a market for all the coke which results from the existing extent of the gas manufacture <\s>
<s> or suppose the reverse case that more coke is wanted at the present prices than can be supplied by the operations required by the existing demand for gas <\s>
<s> coke being now in deficiency will rise in price <\s>
<s> the whole operation will yield more than the usual rate of profit and additional capital will be attracted to the manufacture <\s>
<s> the unsatisfied demand for coke will be supplied but this can not be done without increasing the supply of gas too and as the existing demand was fully supplied already an increased quantity can only find a market by lowering the price <\s>
<s> equilibrium will be attained when the demand for each article fits so well with the demand for the other that the quantity required of each is exactly as much as is generated in producing the quantity required of the other <\s>

<s> values of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>
<s> but when the demand for both is such as to require that each should be grown not only on the soils peculiarly fitted for it but on the medium soils which without being specifically adapted to either are about equally suited for both the cost of production on those medium soils will determine the relative value of the two grains while the rent of the soils specifically adapted to each will be regulated by their productive power considered with reference to that one grain alone to which they are peculiarly applicable <\s>
<s> thus far the question presents no difficulty to any one to whom the general principles of value are familiar <\s>
<s> illustration agricultural produce this may be easily shown by a diagram in which a represents the grade of land best adapted for oats b c d respectively lands of diminishing productiveness for oats until e is reached which is perhaps equally good for oats or wheat a b c d and e likewise represent the wheat lands the best beginning with a <\s>
<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>
<s> so if all the wheat lands are cultivated land a or b is compared with e but in regard to the capacity of e to produce wheat <\s>
<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>
<s> running downward through e with c <\s>
<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>
<s> here then we obtain a fresh illustration in a somewhat different manner of the operation of demand not as an occasional disturber of value but as a permanent regulator of it conjoined with or supplementary to cost of production <\s>
<s> cost of production not a regulator of international values <\s>
<s> extension of the word    international    some things it is physically impossible to produce except in particular circumstances of heat soil water or atmosphere <\s>

<s> the explanation which would be popularly given of this would be that it is cheaper to import than to produce them and this is the true reason <\s>

<s> are things never imported but from places where they can be produced with less labor or less of the other element of cost time than in the place to which they are brought <\s>
<s> does the law that permanent value is proportioned to cost of production hold good between commodities produced in distant places as it does between those produced in adjacent places <\s>
<s> we shall find that it does not <\s>
<s> a thing may sometimes be sold cheapest by being produced in some other place than that at which it can be produced with the smallest amount of labor and abstinence <\s>

<s> but between distant places and especially between different countries profits may continue different because persons do not usually remove themselves or their capitals to a distant place without a very strong motive <\s>

<s> a tendency may even now be observed toward such a state of things capital is becoming more and more cosmopolitan there is so much greater similarity of manners and institutions than formerly and so much less alienation of feeling among the more civilized countries that both population and capital now move from one of those countries to another on much less temptation than heretofore <\s>
<s> but there are still extraordinary differences both of wages and of profits between different parts of the world <\s>

<s> it might seem that a special theory of value is required for international trade as compared with domestic trade for the particular reason that in the former there exists no free movement of labor and capital from one trading country to another <\s>

<s> the demand consequently contracting the production will be somewhat reduced and prices will become stationary when by the joint effect of the rise of gas and the fall of coke so much less of the first is sold and so much more of the second that there is now a market for all the coke which results from the existing extent of the gas manufacture <\s>

<s> values of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>
<s> but when the demand for both is such as to require that each should be grown not only on the soils peculiarly fitted for it but on the medium soils which without being specifically adapted to either are about equally suited for both the cost of production on those medium soils will determine the relative value of the two grains while the rent of the soils specifically adapted to each will be regulated by their productive power considered with reference to that one grain alone to which they are peculiarly applicable <\s>
<s> thus far the question presents no difficulty to any one to whom the general principles of value are familiar <\s>
<s> illustration agricultural produce this may be easily shown by a diagram in which a represents the grade of land best adapted for oats b c d respectively lands of diminishing productiveness for oats until e is reached which is perhaps equally good for oats or wheat a b c d and e likewise represent the wheat lands the best beginning with a <\s>
<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>

<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>
<s> running downward through e with c <\s>
<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>

<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>

<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>
<s> but when the demand for both is such as to require that each should be grown not only on the soils peculiarly fitted for it but on the medium soils which without being specifically adapted to either are about equally suited for both the cost of production on those medium soils will determine the relative value of the two grains while the rent of the soils specifically adapted to each will be regulated by their productive power considered with reference to that one grain alone to which they are peculiarly applicable <\s>

<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>

<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>

<s> to illustrate the cases in which interchange of commodities will not and those in which it will take place between two countries the supposition may be made that the united states has an advantage over england in the production both of iron and of corn <\s>

<s> there are not a few instances of commodities thus associated in their production <\s>
<s> for example coke and coal gas are both produced from the same material and by the same operation <\s>
<s> in a more partial sense mutton and wool are an example beef hides and tallow calves and dairy produce chickens and eggs <\s>
<s> cost of production can have nothing to do with deciding the value of the associated commodities relatively to each other <\s>
<s> it only decides their joint value <\s>
<s> cost of production does not determine their prices but the sum of their prices <\s>
<s> a principle is wanting to apportion the expenses of production between the two <\s>
<s> since cost of production here fails us we must revert to a law of value anterior to cost of production and more fundamental the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> the law is that the demand for a commodity varies with its value and that the value adjusts itself so that the demand shall be equal to the supply <\s>
<s> this supplies the principle of repartition which we are in quest of <\s>
<s> suppose that a certain quantity of gas is produced and sold at a certain price and that the residuum of coke is offered at a price which together with that of the gas repays the expenses with the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> suppose too that at the price put upon the gas and coke respectively the whole of the gas finds an easy market without either surplus or deficiency but that purchasers can not be found for all the coke corresponding to it <\s>

<s> but this lower price together with the price of the gas will not be remunerating the manufacture as a whole will not pay its expenses with the ordinary profit and will not on these terms continue to be carried on <\s>
<s> the gas therefore must be sold at a higher price to make up for the deficiency on the coke <\s>
<s> the demand consequently contracting the production will be somewhat reduced and prices will become stationary when by the joint effect of the rise of gas and the fall of coke so much less of the first is sold and so much more of the second that there is now a market for all the coke which results from the existing extent of the gas manufacture <\s>
<s> or suppose the reverse case that more coke is wanted at the present prices than can be supplied by the operations required by the existing demand for gas <\s>

<s> the unsatisfied demand for coke will be supplied but this can not be done without increasing the supply of gas too and as the existing demand was fully supplied already an increased quantity can only find a market by lowering the price <\s>
<s> equilibrium will be attained when the demand for each article fits so well with the demand for the other that the quantity required of each is exactly as much as is generated in producing the quantity required of the other <\s>

<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>

<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>

<s> there are not a few instances of commodities thus associated in their production <\s>
<s> for example coke and coal gas are both produced from the same material and by the same operation <\s>

<s> values of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>

<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>

<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>

<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>

<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>

<s> the demand consequently contracting the production will be somewhat reduced and prices will become stationary when by the joint effect of the rise of gas and the fall of coke so much less of the first is sold and so much more of the second that there is now a market for all the coke which results from the existing extent of the gas manufacture <\s>

<s> values of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>

<s> thus far the question presents no difficulty to any one to whom the general principles of value are familiar <\s>
<s> illustration agricultural produce this may be easily shown by a diagram in which a represents the grade of land best adapted for oats b c d respectively lands of diminishing productiveness for oats until e is reached which is perhaps equally good for oats or wheat a b c d and e likewise represent the wheat lands the best beginning with a <\s>
<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>

<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>
<s> running downward through e with c <\s>
<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>

<s> the explanation which would be popularly given of this would be that it is cheaper to import than to produce them and this is the true reason <\s>

<s> are things never imported but from places where they can be produced with less labor or less of the other element of cost time than in the place to which they are brought <\s>
<s> does the law that permanent value is proportioned to cost of production hold good between commodities produced in distant places as it does between those produced in adjacent places <\s>
<s> we shall find that it does not <\s>
<s> a thing may sometimes be sold cheapest by being produced in some other place than that at which it can be produced with the smallest amount of labor and abstinence <\s>

<s> to illustrate the cases in which interchange of commodities will not and those in which it will take place between two countries the supposition may be made that the united states has an advantage over england in the production both of iron and of corn <\s>

<s> the demand consequently contracting the production will be somewhat reduced and prices will become stationary when by the joint effect of the rise of gas and the fall of coke so much less of the first is sold and so much more of the second that there is now a market for all the coke which results from the existing extent of the gas manufacture <\s>

<s> values of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>
<s> but when the demand for both is such as to require that each should be grown not only on the soils peculiarly fitted for it but on the medium soils which without being specifically adapted to either are about equally suited for both the cost of production on those medium soils will determine the relative value of the two grains while the rent of the soils specifically adapted to each will be regulated by their productive power considered with reference to that one grain alone to which they are peculiarly applicable <\s>
<s> thus far the question presents no difficulty to any one to whom the general principles of value are familiar <\s>
<s> illustration agricultural produce this may be easily shown by a diagram in which a represents the grade of land best adapted for oats b c d respectively lands of diminishing productiveness for oats until e is reached which is perhaps equally good for oats or wheat a b c d and e likewise represent the wheat lands the best beginning with a <\s>
<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>
<s> so if all the wheat lands are cultivated land a or b is compared with e but in regard to the capacity of e to produce wheat <\s>
<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>
<s> running downward through e with c <\s>
<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>

<s> the explanation which would be popularly given of this would be that it is cheaper to import than to produce them and this is the true reason <\s>

<s> are things never imported but from places where they can be produced with less labor or less of the other element of cost time than in the place to which they are brought <\s>
<s> does the law that permanent value is proportioned to cost of production hold good between commodities produced in distant places as it does between those produced in adjacent places <\s>
<s> we shall find that it does not <\s>
<s> a thing may sometimes be sold cheapest by being produced in some other place than that at which it can be produced with the smallest amount of labor and abstinence <\s>

<s> but between distant places and especially between different countries profits may continue different because persons do not usually remove themselves or their capitals to a distant place without a very strong motive <\s>

<s> a tendency may even now be observed toward such a state of things capital is becoming more and more cosmopolitan there is so much greater similarity of manners and institutions than formerly and so much less alienation of feeling among the more civilized countries that both population and capital now move from one of those countries to another on much less temptation than heretofore <\s>

<s> so that england also got her iron at an advantage over sweden of one half of ten days    labor and yet england had an absolute advantage over sweden in iron of a less amount i e of one fourth of twelve days    labor <\s>
<s> it is to be distinctly understood that by difference in comparative cost we mean a difference in the comparative cost of producing two or more articles in the same country and not the difference of cost of the same article in the different trading countries <\s>

<s> to illustrate the cases in which interchange of commodities will not and those in which it will take place between two countries the supposition may be made that the united states has an advantage over england in the production both of iron and of corn <\s>
<s> it may first be supposed that the advantage is of equal amount in both commodities the iron and the corn each of which required 100 days    labor in the united states requiring each 150 days    labor in england <\s>
<s> it would follow that the iron of 150 days    labor in england if sent to the united states would be equal to the iron of 100 days    labor in the united states if exchanged for corn therefore it would exchange for the corn of only 100 days    labor <\s>

<s> there are not a few instances of commodities thus associated in their production <\s>
<s> for example coke and coal gas are both produced from the same material and by the same operation <\s>
<s> in a more partial sense mutton and wool are an example beef hides and tallow calves and dairy produce chickens and eggs <\s>
<s> cost of production can have nothing to do with deciding the value of the associated commodities relatively to each other <\s>
<s> it only decides their joint value <\s>
<s> cost of production does not determine their prices but the sum of their prices <\s>
<s> a principle is wanting to apportion the expenses of production between the two <\s>
<s> since cost of production here fails us we must revert to a law of value anterior to cost of production and more fundamental the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> the law is that the demand for a commodity varies with its value and that the value adjusts itself so that the demand shall be equal to the supply <\s>
<s> this supplies the principle of repartition which we are in quest of <\s>
<s> suppose that a certain quantity of gas is produced and sold at a certain price and that the residuum of coke is offered at a price which together with that of the gas repays the expenses with the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> suppose too that at the price put upon the gas and coke respectively the whole of the gas finds an easy market without either surplus or deficiency but that purchasers can not be found for all the coke corresponding to it <\s>
<s> the coke will be offered at a lower price in order to force a market <\s>
<s> but this lower price together with the price of the gas will not be remunerating the manufacture as a whole will not pay its expenses with the ordinary profit and will not on these terms continue to be carried on <\s>
<s> the gas therefore must be sold at a higher price to make up for the deficiency on the coke <\s>
<s> the demand consequently contracting the production will be somewhat reduced and prices will become stationary when by the joint effect of the rise of gas and the fall of coke so much less of the first is sold and so much more of the second that there is now a market for all the coke which results from the existing extent of the gas manufacture <\s>
<s> or suppose the reverse case that more coke is wanted at the present prices than can be supplied by the operations required by the existing demand for gas <\s>
<s> coke being now in deficiency will rise in price <\s>

<s> the unsatisfied demand for coke will be supplied but this can not be done without increasing the supply of gas too and as the existing demand was fully supplied already an increased quantity can only find a market by lowering the price <\s>
<s> equilibrium will be attained when the demand for each article fits so well with the demand for the other that the quantity required of each is exactly as much as is generated in producing the quantity required of the other <\s>

<s> values of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>
<s> but when the demand for both is such as to require that each should be grown not only on the soils peculiarly fitted for it but on the medium soils which without being specifically adapted to either are about equally suited for both the cost of production on those medium soils will determine the relative value of the two grains while the rent of the soils specifically adapted to each will be regulated by their productive power considered with reference to that one grain alone to which they are peculiarly applicable <\s>
<s> thus far the question presents no difficulty to any one to whom the general principles of value are familiar <\s>
<s> illustration agricultural produce this may be easily shown by a diagram in which a represents the grade of land best adapted for oats b c d respectively lands of diminishing productiveness for oats until e is reached which is perhaps equally good for oats or wheat a b c d and e likewise represent the wheat lands the best beginning with a <\s>
<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>
<s> so if all the wheat lands are cultivated land a or b is compared with e but in regard to the capacity of e to produce wheat <\s>
<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>
<s> running downward through e with c <\s>
<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>
<s> here then we obtain a fresh illustration in a somewhat different manner of the operation of demand not as an occasional disturber of value but as a permanent regulator of it conjoined with or supplementary to cost of production <\s>
<s> cost of production not a regulator of international values <\s>
<s> extension of the word    international    some things it is physically impossible to produce except in particular circumstances of heat soil water or atmosphere <\s>

<s> the explanation which would be popularly given of this would be that it is cheaper to import than to produce them and this is the true reason <\s>

<s> are things never imported but from places where they can be produced with less labor or less of the other element of cost time than in the place to which they are brought <\s>
<s> does the law that permanent value is proportioned to cost of production hold good between commodities produced in distant places as it does between those produced in adjacent places <\s>

<s> a tendency may even now be observed toward such a state of things capital is becoming more and more cosmopolitan there is so much greater similarity of manners and institutions than formerly and so much less alienation of feeling among the more civilized countries that both population and capital now move from one of those countries to another on much less temptation than heretofore <\s>

<s> to illustrate the cases in which interchange of commodities will not and those in which it will take place between two countries the supposition may be made that the united states has an advantage over england in the production both of iron and of corn <\s>
<s> it may first be supposed that the advantage is of equal amount in both commodities the iron and the corn each of which required 100 days    labor in the united states requiring each 150 days    labor in england <\s>

<s> there are not a few instances of commodities thus associated in their production <\s>
<s> for example coke and coal gas are both produced from the same material and by the same operation <\s>
<s> in a more partial sense mutton and wool are an example beef hides and tallow calves and dairy produce chickens and eggs <\s>

<s> it only decides their joint value <\s>
<s> cost of production does not determine their prices but the sum of their prices <\s>
<s> a principle is wanting to apportion the expenses of production between the two <\s>
<s> since cost of production here fails us we must revert to a law of value anterior to cost of production and more fundamental the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> the law is that the demand for a commodity varies with its value and that the value adjusts itself so that the demand shall be equal to the supply <\s>
<s> this supplies the principle of repartition which we are in quest of <\s>
<s> suppose that a certain quantity of gas is produced and sold at a certain price and that the residuum of coke is offered at a price which together with that of the gas repays the expenses with the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> suppose too that at the price put upon the gas and coke respectively the whole of the gas finds an easy market without either surplus or deficiency but that purchasers can not be found for all the coke corresponding to it <\s>
<s> the coke will be offered at a lower price in order to force a market <\s>
<s> but this lower price together with the price of the gas will not be remunerating the manufacture as a whole will not pay its expenses with the ordinary profit and will not on these terms continue to be carried on <\s>
<s> the gas therefore must be sold at a higher price to make up for the deficiency on the coke <\s>
<s> the demand consequently contracting the production will be somewhat reduced and prices will become stationary when by the joint effect of the rise of gas and the fall of coke so much less of the first is sold and so much more of the second that there is now a market for all the coke which results from the existing extent of the gas manufacture <\s>
<s> or suppose the reverse case that more coke is wanted at the present prices than can be supplied by the operations required by the existing demand for gas <\s>
<s> coke being now in deficiency will rise in price <\s>
<s> the whole operation will yield more than the usual rate of profit and additional capital will be attracted to the manufacture <\s>
<s> the unsatisfied demand for coke will be supplied but this can not be done without increasing the supply of gas too and as the existing demand was fully supplied already an increased quantity can only find a market by lowering the price <\s>
<s> equilibrium will be attained when the demand for each article fits so well with the demand for the other that the quantity required of each is exactly as much as is generated in producing the quantity required of the other <\s>

<s> values of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>
<s> but when the demand for both is such as to require that each should be grown not only on the soils peculiarly fitted for it but on the medium soils which without being specifically adapted to either are about equally suited for both the cost of production on those medium soils will determine the relative value of the two grains while the rent of the soils specifically adapted to each will be regulated by their productive power considered with reference to that one grain alone to which they are peculiarly applicable <\s>
<s> thus far the question presents no difficulty to any one to whom the general principles of value are familiar <\s>
<s> illustration agricultural produce this may be easily shown by a diagram in which a represents the grade of land best adapted for oats b c d respectively lands of diminishing productiveness for oats until e is reached which is perhaps equally good for oats or wheat a b c d and e likewise represent the wheat lands the best beginning with a <\s>
<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>
<s> so if all the wheat lands are cultivated land a or b is compared with e but in regard to the capacity of e to produce wheat <\s>
<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>
<s> running downward through e with c <\s>
<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>
<s> here then we obtain a fresh illustration in a somewhat different manner of the operation of demand not as an occasional disturber of value but as a permanent regulator of it conjoined with or supplementary to cost of production <\s>
<s> cost of production not a regulator of international values <\s>
<s> extension of the word    international    some things it is physically impossible to produce except in particular circumstances of heat soil water or atmosphere <\s>

<s> the explanation which would be popularly given of this would be that it is cheaper to import than to produce them and this is the true reason <\s>

<s> are things never imported but from places where they can be produced with less labor or less of the other element of cost time than in the place to which they are brought <\s>
<s> does the law that permanent value is proportioned to cost of production hold good between commodities produced in distant places as it does between those produced in adjacent places <\s>
<s> we shall find that it does not <\s>
<s> a thing may sometimes be sold cheapest by being produced in some other place than that at which it can be produced with the smallest amount of labor and abstinence <\s>

<s> but between distant places and especially between different countries profits may continue different because persons do not usually remove themselves or their capitals to a distant place without a very strong motive <\s>

<s> a tendency may even now be observed toward such a state of things capital is becoming more and more cosmopolitan there is so much greater similarity of manners and institutions than formerly and so much less alienation of feeling among the more civilized countries that both population and capital now move from one of those countries to another on much less temptation than heretofore <\s>
<s> but there are still extraordinary differences both of wages and of profits between different parts of the world <\s>

<s> it might seem that a special theory of value is required for international trade as compared with domestic trade for the particular reason that in the former there exists no free movement of labor and capital from one trading country to another <\s>

<s> the demand consequently contracting the production will be somewhat reduced and prices will become stationary when by the joint effect of the rise of gas and the fall of coke so much less of the first is sold and so much more of the second that there is now a market for all the coke which results from the existing extent of the gas manufacture <\s>

<s> values of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>
<s> but when the demand for both is such as to require that each should be grown not only on the soils peculiarly fitted for it but on the medium soils which without being specifically adapted to either are about equally suited for both the cost of production on those medium soils will determine the relative value of the two grains while the rent of the soils specifically adapted to each will be regulated by their productive power considered with reference to that one grain alone to which they are peculiarly applicable <\s>
<s> thus far the question presents no difficulty to any one to whom the general principles of value are familiar <\s>
<s> illustration agricultural produce this may be easily shown by a diagram in which a represents the grade of land best adapted for oats b c d respectively lands of diminishing productiveness for oats until e is reached which is perhaps equally good for oats or wheat a b c d and e likewise represent the wheat lands the best beginning with a <\s>
<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>

<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>
<s> running downward through e with c <\s>
<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>

<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>

<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>
<s> but when the demand for both is such as to require that each should be grown not only on the soils peculiarly fitted for it but on the medium soils which without being specifically adapted to either are about equally suited for both the cost of production on those medium soils will determine the relative value of the two grains while the rent of the soils specifically adapted to each will be regulated by their productive power considered with reference to that one grain alone to which they are peculiarly applicable <\s>

<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>

<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>

<s> to illustrate the cases in which interchange of commodities will not and those in which it will take place between two countries the supposition may be made that the united states has an advantage over england in the production both of iron and of corn <\s>

<s> there are not a few instances of commodities thus associated in their production <\s>
<s> for example coke and coal gas are both produced from the same material and by the same operation <\s>
<s> in a more partial sense mutton and wool are an example beef hides and tallow calves and dairy produce chickens and eggs <\s>
<s> cost of production can have nothing to do with deciding the value of the associated commodities relatively to each other <\s>
<s> it only decides their joint value <\s>
<s> cost of production does not determine their prices but the sum of their prices <\s>
<s> a principle is wanting to apportion the expenses of production between the two <\s>
<s> since cost of production here fails us we must revert to a law of value anterior to cost of production and more fundamental the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> the law is that the demand for a commodity varies with its value and that the value adjusts itself so that the demand shall be equal to the supply <\s>
<s> this supplies the principle of repartition which we are in quest of <\s>
<s> suppose that a certain quantity of gas is produced and sold at a certain price and that the residuum of coke is offered at a price which together with that of the gas repays the expenses with the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> suppose too that at the price put upon the gas and coke respectively the whole of the gas finds an easy market without either surplus or deficiency but that purchasers can not be found for all the coke corresponding to it <\s>

<s> but this lower price together with the price of the gas will not be remunerating the manufacture as a whole will not pay its expenses with the ordinary profit and will not on these terms continue to be carried on <\s>
<s> the gas therefore must be sold at a higher price to make up for the deficiency on the coke <\s>
<s> the demand consequently contracting the production will be somewhat reduced and prices will become stationary when by the joint effect of the rise of gas and the fall of coke so much less of the first is sold and so much more of the second that there is now a market for all the coke which results from the existing extent of the gas manufacture <\s>
<s> or suppose the reverse case that more coke is wanted at the present prices than can be supplied by the operations required by the existing demand for gas <\s>

<s> the unsatisfied demand for coke will be supplied but this can not be done without increasing the supply of gas too and as the existing demand was fully supplied already an increased quantity can only find a market by lowering the price <\s>
<s> equilibrium will be attained when the demand for each article fits so well with the demand for the other that the quantity required of each is exactly as much as is generated in producing the quantity required of the other <\s>

<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>

<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>

<s> there are not a few instances of commodities thus associated in their production <\s>
<s> for example coke and coal gas are both produced from the same material and by the same operation <\s>

<s> values of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>

<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>

<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>

<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>

<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>

<s> the demand consequently contracting the production will be somewhat reduced and prices will become stationary when by the joint effect of the rise of gas and the fall of coke so much less of the first is sold and so much more of the second that there is now a market for all the coke which results from the existing extent of the gas manufacture <\s>

<s> values of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>

<s> thus far the question presents no difficulty to any one to whom the general principles of value are familiar <\s>
<s> illustration agricultural produce this may be easily shown by a diagram in which a represents the grade of land best adapted for oats b c d respectively lands of diminishing productiveness for oats until e is reached which is perhaps equally good for oats or wheat a b c d and e likewise represent the wheat lands the best beginning with a <\s>
<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>

<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>
<s> running downward through e with c <\s>
<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>

<s> the explanation which would be popularly given of this would be that it is cheaper to import than to produce them and this is the true reason <\s>

<s> are things never imported but from places where they can be produced with less labor or less of the other element of cost time than in the place to which they are brought <\s>
<s> does the law that permanent value is proportioned to cost of production hold good between commodities produced in distant places as it does between those produced in adjacent places <\s>
<s> we shall find that it does not <\s>
<s> a thing may sometimes be sold cheapest by being produced in some other place than that at which it can be produced with the smallest amount of labor and abstinence <\s>

<s> to illustrate the cases in which interchange of commodities will not and those in which it will take place between two countries the supposition may be made that the united states has an advantage over england in the production both of iron and of corn <\s>

<s> the demand consequently contracting the production will be somewhat reduced and prices will become stationary when by the joint effect of the rise of gas and the fall of coke so much less of the first is sold and so much more of the second that there is now a market for all the coke which results from the existing extent of the gas manufacture <\s>

<s> values of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>
<s> but when the demand for both is such as to require that each should be grown not only on the soils peculiarly fitted for it but on the medium soils which without being specifically adapted to either are about equally suited for both the cost of production on those medium soils will determine the relative value of the two grains while the rent of the soils specifically adapted to each will be regulated by their productive power considered with reference to that one grain alone to which they are peculiarly applicable <\s>
<s> thus far the question presents no difficulty to any one to whom the general principles of value are familiar <\s>
<s> illustration agricultural produce this may be easily shown by a diagram in which a represents the grade of land best adapted for oats b c d respectively lands of diminishing productiveness for oats until e is reached which is perhaps equally good for oats or wheat a b c d and e likewise represent the wheat lands the best beginning with a <\s>
<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>
<s> so if all the wheat lands are cultivated land a or b is compared with e but in regard to the capacity of e to produce wheat <\s>
<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>
<s> running downward through e with c <\s>
<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>

<s> the explanation which would be popularly given of this would be that it is cheaper to import than to produce them and this is the true reason <\s>

<s> are things never imported but from places where they can be produced with less labor or less of the other element of cost time than in the place to which they are brought <\s>
<s> does the law that permanent value is proportioned to cost of production hold good between commodities produced in distant places as it does between those produced in adjacent places <\s>
<s> we shall find that it does not <\s>
<s> a thing may sometimes be sold cheapest by being produced in some other place than that at which it can be produced with the smallest amount of labor and abstinence <\s>

<s> but between distant places and especially between different countries profits may continue different because persons do not usually remove themselves or their capitals to a distant place without a very strong motive <\s>

<s> a tendency may even now be observed toward such a state of things capital is becoming more and more cosmopolitan there is so much greater similarity of manners and institutions than formerly and so much less alienation of feeling among the more civilized countries that both population and capital now move from one of those countries to another on much less temptation than heretofore <\s>

<s> so that england also got her iron at an advantage over sweden of one half of ten days    labor and yet england had an absolute advantage over sweden in iron of a less amount i e of one fourth of twelve days    labor <\s>
<s> it is to be distinctly understood that by difference in comparative cost we mean a difference in the comparative cost of producing two or more articles in the same country and not the difference of cost of the same article in the different trading countries <\s>

<s> to illustrate the cases in which interchange of commodities will not and those in which it will take place between two countries the supposition may be made that the united states has an advantage over england in the production both of iron and of corn <\s>
<s> it may first be supposed that the advantage is of equal amount in both commodities the iron and the corn each of which required 100 days    labor in the united states requiring each 150 days    labor in england <\s>
<s> it would follow that the iron of 150 days    labor in england if sent to the united states would be equal to the iron of 100 days    labor in the united states if exchanged for corn therefore it would exchange for the corn of only 100 days    labor <\s>

<s> there are not a few instances of commodities thus associated in their production <\s>
<s> for example coke and coal gas are both produced from the same material and by the same operation <\s>
<s> in a more partial sense mutton and wool are an example beef hides and tallow calves and dairy produce chickens and eggs <\s>
<s> cost of production can have nothing to do with deciding the value of the associated commodities relatively to each other <\s>
<s> it only decides their joint value <\s>
<s> cost of production does not determine their prices but the sum of their prices <\s>
<s> a principle is wanting to apportion the expenses of production between the two <\s>
<s> since cost of production here fails us we must revert to a law of value anterior to cost of production and more fundamental the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> the law is that the demand for a commodity varies with its value and that the value adjusts itself so that the demand shall be equal to the supply <\s>
<s> this supplies the principle of repartition which we are in quest of <\s>
<s> suppose that a certain quantity of gas is produced and sold at a certain price and that the residuum of coke is offered at a price which together with that of the gas repays the expenses with the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> suppose too that at the price put upon the gas and coke respectively the whole of the gas finds an easy market without either surplus or deficiency but that purchasers can not be found for all the coke corresponding to it <\s>
<s> the coke will be offered at a lower price in order to force a market <\s>
<s> but this lower price together with the price of the gas will not be remunerating the manufacture as a whole will not pay its expenses with the ordinary profit and will not on these terms continue to be carried on <\s>
<s> the gas therefore must be sold at a higher price to make up for the deficiency on the coke <\s>
<s> the demand consequently contracting the production will be somewhat reduced and prices will become stationary when by the joint effect of the rise of gas and the fall of coke so much less of the first is sold and so much more of the second that there is now a market for all the coke which results from the existing extent of the gas manufacture <\s>
<s> or suppose the reverse case that more coke is wanted at the present prices than can be supplied by the operations required by the existing demand for gas <\s>
<s> coke being now in deficiency will rise in price <\s>

<s> the unsatisfied demand for coke will be supplied but this can not be done without increasing the supply of gas too and as the existing demand was fully supplied already an increased quantity can only find a market by lowering the price <\s>
<s> equilibrium will be attained when the demand for each article fits so well with the demand for the other that the quantity required of each is exactly as much as is generated in producing the quantity required of the other <\s>

<s> values of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>
<s> but when the demand for both is such as to require that each should be grown not only on the soils peculiarly fitted for it but on the medium soils which without being specifically adapted to either are about equally suited for both the cost of production on those medium soils will determine the relative value of the two grains while the rent of the soils specifically adapted to each will be regulated by their productive power considered with reference to that one grain alone to which they are peculiarly applicable <\s>
<s> thus far the question presents no difficulty to any one to whom the general principles of value are familiar <\s>
<s> illustration agricultural produce this may be easily shown by a diagram in which a represents the grade of land best adapted for oats b c d respectively lands of diminishing productiveness for oats until e is reached which is perhaps equally good for oats or wheat a b c d and e likewise represent the wheat lands the best beginning with a <\s>
<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>
<s> so if all the wheat lands are cultivated land a or b is compared with e but in regard to the capacity of e to produce wheat <\s>
<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>
<s> running downward through e with c <\s>
<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>
<s> here then we obtain a fresh illustration in a somewhat different manner of the operation of demand not as an occasional disturber of value but as a permanent regulator of it conjoined with or supplementary to cost of production <\s>
<s> cost of production not a regulator of international values <\s>
<s> extension of the word    international    some things it is physically impossible to produce except in particular circumstances of heat soil water or atmosphere <\s>

<s> the explanation which would be popularly given of this would be that it is cheaper to import than to produce them and this is the true reason <\s>

<s> are things never imported but from places where they can be produced with less labor or less of the other element of cost time than in the place to which they are brought <\s>
<s> does the law that permanent value is proportioned to cost of production hold good between commodities produced in distant places as it does between those produced in adjacent places <\s>

<s> a tendency may even now be observed toward such a state of things capital is becoming more and more cosmopolitan there is so much greater similarity of manners and institutions than formerly and so much less alienation of feeling among the more civilized countries that both population and capital now move from one of those countries to another on much less temptation than heretofore <\s>

<s> to illustrate the cases in which interchange of commodities will not and those in which it will take place between two countries the supposition may be made that the united states has an advantage over england in the production both of iron and of corn <\s>
<s> it may first be supposed that the advantage is of equal amount in both commodities the iron and the corn each of which required 100 days    labor in the united states requiring each 150 days    labor in england <\s>

<s> there are not a few instances of commodities thus associated in their production <\s>
<s> for example coke and coal gas are both produced from the same material and by the same operation <\s>
<s> in a more partial sense mutton and wool are an example beef hides and tallow calves and dairy produce chickens and eggs <\s>

<s> it only decides their joint value <\s>
<s> cost of production does not determine their prices but the sum of their prices <\s>
<s> a principle is wanting to apportion the expenses of production between the two <\s>
<s> since cost of production here fails us we must revert to a law of value anterior to cost of production and more fundamental the law of demand and supply <\s>
<s> the law is that the demand for a commodity varies with its value and that the value adjusts itself so that the demand shall be equal to the supply <\s>
<s> this supplies the principle of repartition which we are in quest of <\s>
<s> suppose that a certain quantity of gas is produced and sold at a certain price and that the residuum of coke is offered at a price which together with that of the gas repays the expenses with the ordinary rate of profit <\s>
<s> suppose too that at the price put upon the gas and coke respectively the whole of the gas finds an easy market without either surplus or deficiency but that purchasers can not be found for all the coke corresponding to it <\s>
<s> the coke will be offered at a lower price in order to force a market <\s>
<s> but this lower price together with the price of the gas will not be remunerating the manufacture as a whole will not pay its expenses with the ordinary profit and will not on these terms continue to be carried on <\s>
<s> the gas therefore must be sold at a higher price to make up for the deficiency on the coke <\s>
<s> the demand consequently contracting the production will be somewhat reduced and prices will become stationary when by the joint effect of the rise of gas and the fall of coke so much less of the first is sold and so much more of the second that there is now a market for all the coke which results from the existing extent of the gas manufacture <\s>
<s> or suppose the reverse case that more coke is wanted at the present prices than can be supplied by the operations required by the existing demand for gas <\s>
<s> coke being now in deficiency will rise in price <\s>
<s> the whole operation will yield more than the usual rate of profit and additional capital will be attracted to the manufacture <\s>
<s> the unsatisfied demand for coke will be supplied but this can not be done without increasing the supply of gas too and as the existing demand was fully supplied already an increased quantity can only find a market by lowering the price <\s>
<s> equilibrium will be attained when the demand for each article fits so well with the demand for the other that the quantity required of each is exactly as much as is generated in producing the quantity required of the other <\s>

<s> values of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce <\s>
<s> the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils <\s>
<s> the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops <\s>
<s> for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats <\s>
<s> if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value <\s>
<s> if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value <\s>
<s> the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either <\s>
<s> it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another <\s>
<s> but when the demand for both is such as to require that each should be grown not only on the soils peculiarly fitted for it but on the medium soils which without being specifically adapted to either are about equally suited for both the cost of production on those medium soils will determine the relative value of the two grains while the rent of the soils specifically adapted to each will be regulated by their productive power considered with reference to that one grain alone to which they are peculiarly applicable <\s>
<s> thus far the question presents no difficulty to any one to whom the general principles of value are familiar <\s>
<s> illustration agricultural produce this may be easily shown by a diagram in which a represents the grade of land best adapted for oats b c d respectively lands of diminishing productiveness for oats until e is reached which is perhaps equally good for oats or wheat a b c d and e likewise represent the wheat lands the best beginning with a <\s>
<s> the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least return as e for example <\s>
<s> so if all the wheat lands are cultivated land a or b is compared with e but in regard to the capacity of e to produce wheat <\s>
<s> it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats <\s>
<s> to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land <\s>
<s> their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown <\s>
<s> if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed <\s>
<s> as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c <\s>
<s> then the value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the productiveness of a b etc <\s>
<s> running downward through e with c <\s>
<s> the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or e <\s>
<s> here then we obtain a fresh illustration in a somewhat different manner of the operation of demand not as an occasional disturber of value but as a permanent regulator of it conjoined with or supplementary to cost of production <\s>
<s> cost of production not a regulator of international values <\s>
<s> extension of the word    international    some things it is physically impossible to produce except in particular circumstances of heat soil water or atmosphere <\s>

<s> the explanation which would be popularly given of this would be that it is cheaper to import than to produce them and this is the true reason <\s>

<s> are things never imported but from places where they can be produced with less labor or less of the other element of cost time than in the place to which they are brought <\s>
<s> does the law that permanent value is proportioned to cost of production hold good between commodities produced in distant places as it does between those produced in adjacent places <\s>
<s> we shall find that it does not <\s>
<s> a thing may sometimes be sold cheapest by being produced in some other place than that at which it can be produced with the smallest amount of labor and abstinence <\s>

<s> but between distant places and especially between different countries profits may continue different because persons do not usually remove themselves or their capitals to a distant place without a very strong motive <\s>

<s> a tendency may even now be observed toward such a state of things capital is becoming more and more cosmopolitan there is so much greater similarity of manners and institutions than formerly and so much less alienation of feeling among the more civilized countries that both population and capital now move from one of those countries to another on much less temptation than heretofore <\s>
<s> but there are still extraordinary differences both of wages and of profits between different parts of the world <\s>

<s> it might seem that a special theory of value is required for international trade as compared with domestic trade for the particular reason that in the former there exists no free movement of labor and capital from one trading country to another <\s>

<s> but the corn of 100 days    labor in the united states was supposed to be the same quantity with that of 150 days    labor in england <\s>
<s> with 150 days    labor in iron therefore england would only get as much corn in the united states as she could raise with 150 days    labor at home and she would in importing it have the cost of carriage besides <\s>

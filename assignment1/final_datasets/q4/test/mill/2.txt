<s> but german economists are of interest inasmuch as they have established a new school who urge the use of the historical method in political economy and it is about the question of method that much of the interest of to day centers <\s>
<s> in 1814 savigny introduced this method into jurisprudence and about 1850 it was applied to political economy <\s>
<s> the new school claim that the english    orthodox    writers begin by an a priori process and by deductions reach conclusions which are possibly true of imaginary cases but are not true of man as he really acts <\s>
<s> they therefore assert that economic laws can only be truly discovered by induction or a study of phenomena first as the means of reaching a generalization <\s>
<s> to them bagehot (8 0 answers that scientific bookkeeping or collections of facts in themselves give no results ending in scientific laws for instance since the facts of banking change and vary every day no one can by induction alone reach any laws of banking or for example the study of a panic from the concrete phenomena would be like trying to explain the bursting of a boiler without a theory of steam <\s>
<s> more lately (8 1 since it seems that the new school claim that induction does not preclude deduction and as the old school never intended to disconnect themselves from    comparing conclusions with external facts    there is not such a cause of difference as has previously appeared <\s>
<s> doubtless the insistence upon the merits of induction will be fruitful of good to    orthodox    writers in the more general resort to the collection of statistics and means of verification <\s>
<s> it is suggestive also that the leaders of the new school in germany and england have reached no different results by their new method and in the main agree with the laws evolved by the old english school <\s>
<s> the economist does not pretend that his assumptions are descriptions of economic conditions existing at a given time he simply considers them as forces often acting many on one point or occasion to be inquired into separately inasmuch as concrete phenomena are the resultants of several forces not to be known until we know the separate operation of each of the conjoined forces <\s>
<s> the most prominent of the new school is wilhelm roscher (8 2 of leipsic who wrote a systematic treatise    system der volkswirthschaft    1854 sixteenth edition 1883 in the first division of which the notes contain a marvelous collection of facts and authorities <\s>
<s> he agrees in results with adam smith ricardo malthus and mill but does not seem to have known much of cairnes <\s>
<s> this book however is only a first of four treatises eventually intended to include the political economy of 2 agriculture 3 industry and commerce and 4 the state and commune <\s>
<s> the ablest contemporary of roscher who was probably the first to urge the historical method is karl knies (8 3 in    die politische oekonomie vom standpunkte der geschichtlichen methode    1853 second edition 1881 1883 <\s>
<s> the third of the group who founded the historical school is bruno hildebrand (8 4 of jena author of    die nationalkonomie der gegenwart und zukunft    1848 <\s>
<s> the german mind has always been familiar with the interference of the state and a class of writers has arisen not only advocating the inductive method but strongly imbued with a belief in a close connection of the state with industry and inasmuch as the essence of modern socialism is a resort to state help this body of men with wagner at their head has received the name of    socialists (8 5 of the chair    and now wield a wide influence in germany <\s>
<s> of these writers (8 6 wagner engel schmoller von scheel brentano held schnberg and schffle are the most prominent <\s>
<s> the historical school has received the adhesion of   mile de laveleye (8 7 in belgium and other economists in england and the united states <\s>
<s> while cliffe leslie has been the most vigorous opponent of the methods of the old school there have been many others of less distinction <\s>
<s> indeed the period the close of which is marked by j <\s>
<s> mccullochs book was one in which the old school had seemingly come to an end of its progress from too close an adhesion to deductions from assumed premises <\s>
<s> mills great merit was that he began the movement to better adapt political economy to society as it actually existed and the historical school will probably give a most desirable impetus to the same results even though its exaggerated claims as to the true method (8 8) can not possibly be admitted <\s>
<s> italian writers have not received hitherto the attention they deserve <\s>
<s> after 1830 besides rossi who went to france there was romagnosi who dealt more with the relations of economics to other studies cattanes who turned to rural questions and free trade combating the german list ); scialoja at the university of turin and francesco ferrara also at turin from 1849 to 1858 <\s>
<s> the latter was a follower of bastiat and carey as regards value and rent and at the same time was a radical believer in laissez faire <\s>
<s> since the union of italy there has been a new interest in economic study as with us after our war <\s>
<s> the most eminent living italian economist is said to be angelo messedaglia holding a chair at padua since 1858 <\s>
<s> he has excelled in statistical and financial subjects and is now engaged on a treatise on money    moneta    of which one part has been issued 1882 <\s>
<s> marco minghetti and fedele lampertico stand above others the former for a study of the connection of political economy with morals and for his public career as a statesman the latter for his studies on paper money and other subjects <\s>
<s> carlo ferrais presented a good monograph on    money and the forced currency    1879 ); and boccardo issued a library of selected works of the best economists and a large dictionary of political economy    dizionario universale di economia politica e di commercio    2 vols second edition 1875 <\s>
<s> luigi luzzati is a vigorous advocate of co operation and elia lattes has made a serious study of the early venetian banks <\s>
<s> political economy has gained little from american writers <\s>
<s> of our statesmen none have made any additions to the science and only hamilton and gallatin can properly be called economists <\s>
<s> hamilton in his famous    report on manufactures    1791 shared in some of the erroneous conceptions of his day but this paper together with his reports on a national bank and the public credit are evidences of a real economic power <\s>
<s> gallatins    memorial in favor of tariff reform    1832 is as able as hamiltons report on manufactures and a strong argument against protection <\s>
<s> both men made a reputation as practical financiers <\s>

<s> in simpler terms value is measured by the cost of reproduction <\s>
<s> the value of every article thus declines as the arts advance while the general command of commodities constantly increases <\s>
<s> this causes a constant fall in the value of accumulated capital as compared with the results of present labor from which is inferred a tendency toward harmony rather than divergence of interests between capitalist and laborer    this theory of value 93 he applied to land and even to man in his desire to give it universality <\s>
<s> he next claimed to have discovered a law of increasing production from land in his    past present and future    1848 which was diametrically opposed to ricardos law of diminishing returns <\s>
<s> his proof was an historical one that in fact the poorer not the richer lands were first taken into cultivation <\s>
<s> this however did not explain the fact that different grades of land are simultaneously under cultivation on which ricardos doctrine of rent is based <\s>
<s> the constantly increasing production of land naturally led carey to believe in the indefinite increase of population <\s>
<s> he however was logically brought to accept the supposed law of an ultimate limit to numbers suggested by herbert spencer based on a diminution of human fertility <\s>
<s> he tried to identify physical and social laws and fused his political economy in a system of    social science    1853 and his    unity of law    1872 <\s>
<s> from about 1845 he became a protectionist and his writings were vigorously controversial <\s>
<s> in his doctrines on money he is distinctly a mercantilist ;( 94 but by his earnest attacks on all that has been gained in the science up to his day he has done a great service in stimulating inquiry and causing a better statement of results <\s>
<s> while undoubtedly the best known of american writers yet because of a prolix style and an illogical habit of mind he has had no extended influence on his countrymen 95 the effect of the civil war is now beginning to show itself in an unmistakable drift toward the investigation of economic questions and there is a distinctly energetic tone which may bring new contributions from american writers <\s>
<s> walker 96 in his study on    the wages question    1876 has combated the wages fund theory and proposed in its place a doctrine that wages are paid out of the product and not out of accumulated capital <\s>
<s> sumner 97 is a vigorous writer in the school of mill and cairnes and has done good work in the cause of sound money doctrines <\s>
<s> both general walker and professor sumner hold to the method of economic investigation as expounded by mr <\s>
<s> cairnes although several younger economists show the influence of the german school <\s>
<s> perry 98 of williams college adopted bastiats theory of value <\s>
<s> he also accepts the wages fund theory rejects the law of malthus and although believing in the law of diminishing returns from land regards rent as the reward for a service rendered <\s>
<s> another writer henry george 99 has gained an abnormal prominence by a plausible book    progress and poverty    1880 which rejects the doctrine of malthus and argues that the increase of production of any kind augments the demand for land and so raises its value <\s>
<s> his conclusions lead him to advocate the nationalization of land <\s>
<s> although in opposition to almost all that political economy has yet produced his writing has drawn to him very unusual notice <\s>
<s> the increasing interest in social questions and the general lack of economic training which prevents a right estimate of his reasoning by people in general sufficiently account for the wide attention he has received <\s>

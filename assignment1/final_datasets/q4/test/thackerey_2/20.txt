<s> she had but to raise her finger and he would come back from ever so far she had but to say i have discarded such and such an adorer and the poor infatuated wretch would be sure to come and roder about her mother's house willing to be put on the ranks of suitors though he knew he might be cast off the next week <\s>
<s> if he were like ulysses in his folly at least she was in so far like penelope that she had a crowd of suitors and undid day after day and night after night the handiwork of fascination and the web of coquetry with which she was wont to allure and entertain them <\s>
<s> part of her coquetry may have come from her position about the court where the beautiful maid of honor was the light about which a thousand beaux came and fluttered where she was sure to have a ring of admirers round her crowding to listen to her repartees as much as to admire her beauty and where she spoke and listened to much free talk such as one never would have thought the lips or ears of rachel castlewood's daughter would have uttered or heard <\s>
<s> when in waiting at windsor or hampton the court ladies and gentlemen would be making riding parties together mrs <\s>
<s> beatrix in a horseman's coat and hat the foremost after the stag hounds and over the park fences a crowd of young fellows at her heels <\s>
<s> if the english country ladies at this time were the most pure and modest of any ladies in the world the english town and court ladies permitted themselves words and behavior that were neither modest nor pure and claimed some of them a freedom which those who love that sex most would never wish to grant them <\s>

<s> swift and others what was the conversation and what the habits of our time <\s>
<s> the most beautiful woman in england in 1712 when esmond returned to this country a lady of high birth and though of no fortune to be sure with a thousand fascinations of wit and manners beatrix esmond was now six and twenty years old and beatrix esmond still <\s>
<s> of her hundred adorers she had not chosen one for a husband and those who had asked had been jilted by her and more still had left her <\s>
<s> a succession of near ten years crops of beauties had come up since her time and had been reaped by proper husbandmen if we may make an agricultural simile and had been housed comfortably long ago <\s>
<s> her own contemporaries were sober mothers by this time girls with not a tithe of her charms or her wit having made good matches and now claiming precedence over the spinster who but lately had derided and outshone them <\s>
<s> the young beauties were beginning to look down on beatrix as an old maid and sneer and call her one of charles ii s ladies and ask whether her portrait was not in the hampton court gallery <\s>
<s> but still she reigned at least in one man's opinion superior over all the little misses that were the toasts of the young lads and in esmond's eyes was ever perfectly lovely and young <\s>
<s> who knows how many were nearly made happy by possessing her or rather how many were fortunate in escaping this siren <\s>
<s> tis a marvel to think that her mother was the purest and simplest woman in the whole world and that this girl should have been born from her <\s>
<s> i am inclined to fancy my mistress who never said a harsh word to her children and but twice or thrice only to one person must have been too fond and pressing with the maternal authority for her son and her daughter both revolted early nor after their first flight from the nest could they ever be brought back quite to the fond mother's bosom <\s>
<s> lady castlewood and perhaps it was as well knew little of her daughter's life and real thoughts <\s>
<s> how was she to apprehend what passes in queen's ante chambers and at court tables <\s>
<s> beatrix asserted her own authority so resolutely that her mother quickly gave in <\s>
<s> the maid of honor had her own equipage went from home and came back at her own will her mother was alike powerless to resist her or to lead her or to command or to persuade her <\s>
<s> she had been engaged once twice thrice to be married esmond believed <\s>
<s> when he quitted home it hath been said she was promised to my lord ashburnham and now on his return behold his lordship was just married to lady mary butler the duke of ormonde's daughter and his fine houses and twelve thousand a year of fortune for which miss beatrix had rather coveted him was out of her power <\s>
<s> to her esmond could say nothing in regard to the breaking of this match and asking his mistress about it all lady castlewood answered was do not speak to me about it harry <\s>
<s> i cannot tell you how or why they parted and i fear to inquire <\s>
<s> i have told you before that with all her kindness and wit and generosity and that sort of splendor of nature she has i can say but little good of poor beatrix and look with dread at the marriage she will form <\s>
<s> her mind is fixed on ambition only and making a great figure and this achieved she will tire of it as she does of everything <\s>
<s> heaven help her husband whoever he shall be <\s>
<s> my lord ashburnham was a most excellent young man gentle and yet manly of very good parts so they told me and as my little conversation would enable me to judge and a kind temper kind and enduring i'm sure he must have been from all that he had to endure <\s>
<s> but he quitted her at last from some crowning piece of caprice or tyranny of hers and now he has married a young woman that will make him a thousand times happier than my poor girl ever could <\s>
<s> the rupture whatever its cause was i heard the scandal but indeed shall not take pains to repeat at length in this diary the trumpery coffee house story caused a good deal of low talk and mr <\s>
<s> esmond was present at my lord's appearance at the birthday with his bride over whom the revenge that beatrix took was to look so imperial and lovely that the modest downcast young lady could not appear beside her and lord ashburnham who had his reasons for wishing to avoid her slunk away quite shamefaced and very early <\s>
<s> this time his grace the duke of hamilton whom esmond had seen about her before was constant at miss beatrix's side he was one of the most splendid gentlemen of europe accomplished by books by travel by long command of the best company distinguished as a statesman having been ambassador in king williamn's time and a noble speaker in the scots parliament where he had led the party that was against the union and though now five or six and forty years of age a gentleman so high in stature accomplished in wit and favored in person that he might pretend to the hand of any princess in europe <\s>

<s> but to return to our little spectator paper and the conversation which grew out of it <\s>
<s> miss beatrix at first was quite bit as the phrase of that day was and did not smoke the authorship of the story indeed esmond had tried to imitate as well as he could mr <\s>
<s> steele's manner as for the other author of the spectator his prose style i think is altogether inimitable ); and dick who was the idlest and best natured of men would have let the piece pass into his journal and go to posterity as one of his own lucubrations but that esmond did not care to have a lady's name whom he loved sent forth to the world in a light so unfavorable <\s>
<s> beatrix pished and psha'd over the paper colonel esmond watching with no little interest her countenance as she read it <\s>
<s> how stupid your friend mr <\s>
<s> will he never have done with epsom and tunbridge and with beaux at church and jocastas and lindamiras <\s>
<s> why does he not call women nelly and betty as their godfathers and godmothers did for them in their baptism <\s>
<s> says her mother speak gravely of grave things <\s>
<s> mamma thinks the church catechism came from heaven i believe says beatrix with a laugh and was brought down by a bishop from a mountain <\s>
<s> oh how i used to break my heart over it <\s>
<s> besides i had a popish godmother mamma why did you give me one <\s>
<s> i gave you the queen's name says her mother blushing <\s>

<s> beatrix went on reading spell my name with a y why you wretch says she turning round to colonel esmond you have been telling my story to mr <\s>
<s> steele or stop you have written the paper yourself to turn me into ridicule <\s>
<s> esmond felt rather frightened and told a truth which was nevertheless an entire falsehood <\s>
<s> upon my honor says he i have not even read the spectator of this morning <\s>
<s> nor had he for that was not the spectator but a sham newspaper put in its place <\s>
<s> she went on reading her face rather flushed as she read <\s>

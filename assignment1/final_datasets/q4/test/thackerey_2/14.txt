<s> esmond wished to cut short the good father's theology and succeeded and the other sighing over his pupil's invincible ignorance did not withdraw his affection from him but gave him his utmost confidence as much that is to say as a priest can give more than most do; for he was naturally garrulous and too eager to speak <\s>

<s> she became with child of you was cursed by her own parents at that discovery though she never upbraided except by her involuntary tears and the misery depicted on her countenance the author of her wretchedness and ruin <\s>
<s> thomas esmond captain thomas as he was called became engaged in a gaming house brawl of which the consequence was a duel and a wound so severe that he never his surgeon said could outlive it <\s>
<s> thinking his death certain and touched with remorse he sent for a priest of the very church of st <\s>
<s> gudule where i met you and on the same day after his making submission to our church was married to your mother a few weeks before you were born <\s>
<s> my lord viscount castlewood marquis of esmond by king james's patent which i myself took to your father your lordship was christened at st <\s>
<s> gudule by the same cure who married your parents and by the name of henry thomas son of e <\s>
<s> thomas officier anglois and gertrude maes <\s>
<s> you see you belong to us from your birth and why i did not christen you when you became my dear little pupil at castlewood <\s>
<s> your father's wound took a favorable turn perhaps his conscience was eased by the right he had done and to the surprise of the doctors he recovered <\s>
<s> but as his health came back his wicked nature too returned <\s>
<s> he was tired of the poor girl whom he had ruined and receiving some remittance from his uncle my lord the old viscount then in england he pretended business promised return and never saw your poor mother more <\s>
<s> he owned to me in confession first but afterwards in talk before your aunt his wife else i never could have disclosed what i now tell you that on coming to london he writ a pretended confession to poor gertrude maes gertrude esmond of his having been married in england previously before uniting himself with her said that his name was not thomas that he was about to quit europe for the virginian plantations where indeed your family had a grant of land from king charles the first sent her a supply of money the half of the last hundred guineas he had entreated her pardon and bade her farewell <\s>
<s> poor gertrude never thought that the news in this letter might be untrue as the rest of your father's conduct to her <\s>
<s> but though a young man of her own degree who knew her history and whom she liked before she saw the english gentleman who was the cause of all her misery offered to marry her and to adopt you as his own child and give you his name she refused him <\s>
<s> this refusal only angered her father who had taken her home she never held up her head there being the subject of constant unkindness after her fall and some devout ladies of her acquaintance offering to pay a little pension for her she went into a convent and you were put out to nurse <\s>
<s> a sister of the young fellow who would have adopted you as his son was the person who took charge of you <\s>
<s> your mother and this person were cousins <\s>
<s> she had just lost a child of her own which you replaced your own mother being too sick and feeble to feed you and presently your nurse grew so fond of you that she even grudged letting you visit the convent where your mother was and where the nuns petted the little infant as they pitied and loved its unhappy parent <\s>
<s> her vocation became stronger every day and at the end of two years she was received as a sister of the house <\s>
<s> your nurse's family were silk weavers out of france whither they returned to arras in french flanders shortly before your mother took her vows carrying you with them then a child of three years old <\s>
<s> twas a town before the late vigorous measures of the french king full of protestants and here your nurse's father old pastoureau he with whom you afterwards lived at ealing adopted the reformed doctrines perverting all his house with him <\s>
<s> they were expelled thence by the edict of his most christian majesty and came to london and set up their looms in spittlefields <\s>
<s> the old man brought a little money with him and carried on his trade but in a poor way <\s>
<s> he was a widower by this time his daughter a widow too kept house for him and his son and he labored together at their vocation <\s>
<s> meanwhile your father had publicly owned his conversion just before king charles's death in whom our church had much such another convert was reconciled to my lord viscount castlewood and married as you know to his daughter <\s>
<s> it chanced that the younger pastoureau going with a piece of brocade to the mercer who employed him on ludgate hill met his old rival coming out of an ordinary there <\s>
<s> pastoureau knew your father at once seized him by the collar and upbraided him as a villain who had seduced his mistress and afterwards deserted her and her son <\s>
<s> thomas esmond also recognized pastoureau at once besought him to calm his indignation and not to bring a crowd round about them and bade him to enter into the tavern out of which he had just stepped when he would give him any explanation <\s>
<s> pastoureau entered and heard the landlord order the drawer to show captain thomas to a room it was by his christian name that your father was familiarly called at his tavern haunts which to say the truth were none of the most reputable <\s>
<s> i must tell you that captain thomas or my lord viscount afterwards was never at a loss for a story and could cajole a woman or a dun with a volubility and an air of simplicity at the same time of which many a creditor of his has been the dupe <\s>
<s> his tales used to gather verisimilitude as he went on with them <\s>
<s> he strung together fact after fact with a wonderful rapidity and coherence <\s>
<s> it required saving your presence a very long habit of acquaintance with your father to know when his lordship was l telling the truth or no <\s>
<s> he told me with rueful remorse when he was ill for the fear of death set him instantly repenting and with shrieks of laughter when he was well his lordship having a very great sense of humor how in a half an hour's time and before a bottle was drunk he had completely succeeded in biting poor pastoureau <\s>
<s> the seduction he owned to that he could not help he was quite ready with tears at a moment's warning and shed them profusely to melt his credulous listener <\s>
<s> he wept for your mother even more than pastoureau did who cried very heartily poor fellow as my lord informed me he swore upon his honor that he had twice sent money to brussels and mentioned the name of the merchant with whom it was lying for poor gertrude's use <\s>
<s> he did not even know whether she had a child or no or whether she was alive or dead but got these facts easily out of honest pastoureau's answers to him <\s>
<s> when he heard that she was in a convent he said he hoped to end his days in one himself should he survive his wife whom he hated and had been forced by a cruel father to marry and when he was told that gertrude's son was alive and actually in london i started says he for then damme my wife was expecting to lie in and i thought should this old put my father in law run rusty here would be a good chance to frighten him <\s>
<s> he expressed the deepest gratitude to the pastoureau family for the care of the infant you were now near six years old and on pastoureau bluntly telling him when he proposed to go that instant and see the darling child that they never wished to see his ill omened face again within their doors that he might have the boy though they should all be very sorry to lose him and that they would take his money they being poor if he gave it or bring him up by god's help as they had hitherto done without he acquiesced in this at once with a sigh said well twas better that the dear child should remain with friends who had been so admirably kind to him and in his talk to me afterwards honestly praised and admired the weaver's conduct and spirit owned that the frenchman was a right fellow and he the lord have mercy upon him a sad villain <\s>
<s> holt went on to say was good natured with his money when he had it and having that day received a supply from his uncle gave the weaver ten pieces with perfect freedom and promised him further remittances <\s>
<s> he took down eagerly pastoureau's name and place of abode in his table book and when the other asked him for his own gave with the utmost readiness his name as captain thomas new lodge penzance cornwall he said he was in london for a few days only on business connected with his wife's property described her as a shrew though a woman of kind disposition and depicted his father as a cornish squire in an infirm state of health at whose death he hoped for something handsome when he promised richly to reward the admirable protector of his child and to provide for the boy <\s>
<s> and by gad sir he said to me in his strange laughing way i ordered a piece of brocade of the very same pattern as that which the fellow was carrying and presented it to my wife for a morning wrapper to receive company after she lay in of our little boy <\s>
<s> your little pension was paid regularly enough and when your father became viscount castlewood on his uncle's demise i was employed to keep a watch over you and twas at my instance that you were brought home <\s>
<s> your foster mother was dead her father made acquaintance with a woman whom he married who quarrelled with his son <\s>
<s> the faithful creature came back to brussels to be near the woman he loved and died too a few months before her <\s>
<s> will you see her cross in the convent cemetery <\s>
<s> the superior is an old penitent of mine and remembers soeur marie madeleine fondly still <\s>
<s> esmond came to this spot in one sunny evening of spring and saw amidst a thousand black crosses casting their shadows across the grassy mounds that particular one which marked his mother's resting place <\s>
<s> many more of those poor creatures that lay there had adopted that same name with which sorrow had rebaptized her and which fondly seemed to hint their individual story of love and grief <\s>
<s> he fancied her in tears and darkness kneeling at the foot of her cross under which her cares were buried <\s>
<s> surely he knelt down and said his own prayer there not in sorrow so much as in awe for even his memory had no recollection of her and in pity for the pangs which the gentle soul in life had been made to suffer <\s>
<s> to this cross she brought them for this heavenly bridegroom she exchanged the husband who had wooed her the traitor who had left her <\s>
<s> a thousand such hillocks lay round about the gentle daisies springing out of the grass over them and each bearing its cross and requiescat <\s>
<s> a nun veiled in black was kneeling hard by at a sleeping sister's bedside so fresh made that the spring had scarce had time to spin a coverlid for it ); beyond the cemetery walls you had glimpses of life and the world and the spires and gables of the city <\s>
<s> a bird came down from a roof opposite and lit first on a cross and then on the grass below it whence it flew away presently with a leaf in its mouth then came a sound as of chanting from the chapel of the sisters hard by others had long since filled the place which poor mary magdeleine once had there were kneeling at the same stall and hearing the same hymns and prayers in which her stricken heart had found consolation <\s>
<s> might she sleep in peace might she sleep in peace and we too when our struggles and pains are over <\s>
<s> but the earth is the lord's as the heaven is we are alike his creatures here and yonder <\s>
<s> i took a little flower off the hillock and kissed it and went my way like the bird that had just lighted on the cross by me back into the world again <\s>
<s> silent receptacle of death tranquil depth of calm out of reach of tempest and trouble <\s>
<s> i felt as one who had been walking below the sea and treading amidst the bones of shipwrecks <\s>
<s> the campaign of 1707 1708 <\s>
<s> during the whole of the year which succeeded that in which the glorious battle of ramillies had been fought our army made no movement of importance much to the disgust of very many of our officers remaining inactive in flanders who said that his grace the captain general had had fighting enough and was all for money now and the enjoyment of his five thousand a year and his splendid palace at woodstock which was now being built <\s>
<s> and his grace had sufficient occupation fighting his enemies at home this year where it began to be whispered that his favor was decreasing and his duchess losing her hold on the queen who was transferring her royal affections to the famous mrs <\s>
<s> masham's humble servant mr <\s>
<s> against their intrigues our duke passed a great part of his time intriguing <\s>
<s> harley was got out of office and his grace in so far had a victory <\s>
<s> but her majesty convinced against her will was of that opinion still of which the poet says people are when so convinced and mr <\s>
<s> harley before long had his revenge <\s>
<s> meanwhile the business of fighting did not go on any way to the satisfaction of marlborough's gallant lieutenants <\s>
<s> during all 1707 with the french before us we had never so much as a battle our army in spain was utterly routed at almanza by the gallant duke of berwick and we of webb's which regiment the young duke had commanded before his father's abdication were a little proud to think that it was our colonel who had achieved this victory <\s>
<s> i think if i had had galway's place and my fusileers says our general we would not have laid down our arms even to our old colonel as galway did and webb's officers swore if we had had webb at least we would not have been taken prisoners <\s>
<s> our dear old general talked incautiously of himself and of others a braver or a more brilliant soldier never lived than he but he blew his honest trumpet rather more loudly than became a commander of his station and mighty man of valor as he was shook his great spear and blustered before the army too fiercely <\s>
<s> holtz went off on a secret expedition in the early part of 1708 with great elation of spirits and a prophecy to esmond that a wonderful something was about to take place <\s>
<s> this secret came out on my friend's return to the army whither he brought a most rueful and dejected countenance and owned that the great something he had been engaged upon had failed utterly <\s>
<s> he had been indeed with that luckless expedition of the chevalier de st <\s>
<s> george who was sent by the french king with ships and an army from dunkirk and was to have invaded and conquered scotland <\s>
<s> but that ill wind which ever opposed all the projects upon which the prince ever embarked prevented the chevalier's invasion of scotland as tis known and blew poor monsieur von holtz back into our camp again to scheme and foretell and to pry about as usual <\s>
<s> the chevalier the king of england as some of us held him went from dunkirk to the french army to make the campaign against us <\s>
<s> the duke of burgundy had the command this year having the duke of berry with him and the famous mareschal vendosme and the duke of matignon to aid him in the campaign <\s>
<s> holtz who knew everything that was passing in flanders and france and the indies for what i know insisted that there would be no more fighting in 1708 than there had been in the previous year and that our commander had reasons for keeping him quiet <\s>
<s> indeed esmond's general who was known as a grumbler and to have a hearty mistrust of the great duke and hundreds more officers besides did not scruple to say that these private reasons came to the duke in the shape of crown pieces from the french king by whom the generalissimo was bribed to avoid a battle <\s>
<s> there were plenty of men in our lines quidnuncs to whom mr <\s>
<s> webb listened only too willingly who could specify the exact sums the duke got how much fell to cadogan's share and what was the precise fee given to doctor hare <\s>
<s> and the successes with which the french began the campaign of 1708 served to give strength to these reports of treason which were in everybody's mouth <\s>
<s> our general allowed the enemy to get between us and ghent and declined to attack him though for eight and forty hours the armies were in presence of each other <\s>
<s> ghent was taken and on the same day monsieur de la mothe summoned bruges and these two great cities fell into the hands of the french without firing a shot <\s>
<s> a few days afterwards la mothe seized upon the fort of plashendall and it began to be supposed that all spanish flanders as well as brabant would fall into the hands of the french troops when the prince eugene arrived from the mozelle and then there was no more shilly shallying <\s>
<s> the prince of savoy always signalized his arrival at the army by a great feast my lord duke's entertainments were both seldom and shabby ): and i remember our general returning from this dinner with the two commanders in chief his honest head a little excited by wine which was dealt out much more liberally by the austrian than by the english commander now says my general slapping the table with an oath he must fight and when he is forced to it d it no man in europe can stand up against jack churchill <\s>
<s> within a week the battle of oudenarde was fought when hate each other as they might esmond's general and the commander in chief were forced to admire each other so splendid was the gallantry of each upon this day <\s>
<s> the brigade commanded by major general webb gave and received about as hard knocks as any that were delivered in that action in which mr <\s>
<s> esmond had the fortune to serve at the head of his own company in his regiment under the command of their own colonel as major general and it was his good luck to bring the regiment out of action as commander of it the four senior officers above him being killed in the prodigious slaughter which happened on that day <\s>
<s> i like to think that jack haythorn who sneered at me for being a bastard and a parasite of webb's as he chose to call me and with whom i had had words shook hands with me the day before the battle began <\s>

<s> i suppose tis that infernal botte de jesuite that makes you so bold he added <\s>
<s> tis the peace of the family i love best in the world harry esmond said warmly tis the honor of a noble benefactor the happiness of my dear mistress and her children <\s>
<s> i owe them everything in life my lord and would lay it down for any one of them <\s>
<s> what brings you here to disturb this quiet household <\s>

<s> by the lord i believe thou hast an eye to the pretty puritan thyself master harry says my lord with his reckless good humored laugh and as if he had been listening with interest to the passionate appeal of the young man <\s>
<s> art thou in love with her thyself <\s>
<s> hath tipsy frank esmond come by the way of all flesh <\s>
<s> my lord my lord cried harry his face flushing and his eyes filling as he spoke i never had a mother but i love this lady as one <\s>
<s> i worship her as a devotee worships a saint <\s>
<s> to hear her name spoken lightly seems blasphemy to me <\s>
<s> would you dare think of your own mother so or suffer any one so to speak of her <\s>
<s> it is a horror to me to fancy that any man should think of her impurely <\s>
<s> i implore you i beseech you to leave her <\s>
<s> danger will come out of it <\s>
<s> says my lord giving a cut to the horses which at this minute for we were got on to the downs fairly ran off into a gallop that no pulling could stop <\s>
<s> he had arrived on horseback with his people but when his gout broke out my lord mohun sent to london for a light chaise he had drawn by a pair of small horses and running as swift wherever roads were good as a laplander's sledge <\s>
<s> when this carriage came his lordship was eager to drive the lady castlewood abroad in it and did so many times and at a rapid pace greatly to his companion's enjoyment who loved the swift motion and the healthy breezes over the downs which lie hard upon castlewood and stretch thence towards the sea <\s>
<s> as this amusement was very pleasant to her and her lord far from showing any mistrust of her intimacy with lord mohun encouraged her to be his companion as if willing by his present extreme confidence to make up for any past mistrust which his jealousy had shown the lady castlewood enjoyed herself freely in this harmless diversion which it must be owned her guest was very eager to give her and it seemed that she grew the more free with lord mohun and pleased with his company because of some sacrifice which his gallantry was pleased to make in her favor <\s>
<s> seeing the two gentlemen constantly at cards still of evenings harry esmond one day deplored to his mistress that this fatal infatuation of her lord should continue and now they seemed reconciled together begged his lady to hint to her husband that he should play no more <\s>
<s> but lady castlewood smiling archly and gayly said she would speak to him presently and that for a few nights more at least he might be let to have his amusement <\s>
<s> indeed madam said harry you know not what it costs you and tis easy for any observer who knows the game to see that lord mohun is by far the stronger of the two <\s>
<s> i know he is says my lady still with exceeding good humor he is not only the best player but the kindest player in the world <\s>
<s> esmond cried transported and provoked <\s>
<s> debts of honor must be paid some time or other and my master will be ruined if he goes on <\s>
<s> harry shall i tell you a secret <\s>
<s> my lady replied with kindness and pleasure still in her eyes <\s>
<s> francis will not be ruined if he goes on he will be rescued if he goes on <\s>
<s> i repent of having spoken and thought unkindly of the lord mohun when he was here in the past year <\s>
<s> he is full of much kindness and good and tis my belief that we shall bring him to better things <\s>
<s> i have lent him tillotson and your favorite bishop taylor and he is much touched he says and as a proof of his repentance and herein lies my secret what do you think he is doing with francis <\s>
<s> he is letting poor frank win his money back again <\s>
<s> he hath won already at the last four nights and my lord mohun says that he will not be the means of injuring poor frank and my dear children <\s>
<s> and in god's name what do you return him for the sacrifice <\s>
<s> asked esmond aghast who knew enough of men and of this one in particular to be aware that such a finished rake gave nothing for nothing <\s>
<s> how in heaven's name are you to pay him <\s>
<s> with a mother's blessing and a wife's prayers <\s>
<s> cries my lady clasping her hands together <\s>
<s> harry esmond did not know whether to laugh to be angry or to love his dear mistress more than ever for the obstinate innocency with which she chose to regard the conduct of a man of the world whose designs he knew better how to interpret <\s>
<s> he told the lady guardedly but so as to make his meaning quite clear to her what he knew in respect of the former life and conduct of this nobleman of other women against whom he had plotted and whom he had overcome of the conversation which he harry himself had had with lord mohun wherein the lord made a boast of his libertinism and frequently avowed that he held all women to be fair game as his lordship styled this pretty sport and that they were all without exception to be won <\s>
<s> and the return harry had for his entreaties and remonstrances was a fit of anger on lady castlewood's part who would not listen to his accusations she said and retorted that he himself must be very wicked and perverted to suppose evil designs where she was sure none were meant <\s>
<s> and this is the good meddlers get of interfering harry thought to himself with much bitterness and his perplexity and annoyance were only the greater because he could not speak to my lord castlewood himself upon a subject of this nature or venture to advise or warn him regarding a matter so very sacred as his own honor of which my lord was naturally the best guardian <\s>
<s> but though lady castlewood would listen to no advice from her young dependant and appeared indignantly to refuse it when offered harry had the satisfaction to find that she adopted the counsel which she professed to reject for the next day she pleaded a headache when my lord mohun would have had her drive out and the next day the headache continued and next day in a laughing gay way she proposed that the children should take her place in his lordship's car for they would be charmed with a ride of all things and she must not have all the pleasure for herself <\s>
<s> my lord gave them a drive with a very good grace though i dare say with rage and disappointment inwardly not that his heart was very seriously engaged in his designs upon this simple lady but the life of such men is often one of intrigue and they can no more go through the day without a woman to pursue than a fox hunter without his sport after breakfast <\s>
<s> under an affected carelessness of demeanor and though there was no outward demonstration of doubt upon his patron's part since the quarrel between the two lords harry yet saw that lord castlewood was watching his guest very narrowly and caught sight of distrust and smothered rage as harry thought which foreboded no good <\s>
<s> on the point of honor esmond knew how touchy his patron was and watched him almost as a physician watches a patient and it seemed to him that this one was slow to take the disease though he could not throw off the poison when once it had mingled with his blood <\s>
<s> we read in shakspeare whom the writer for his part considers to be far beyond mr <\s>
<s> dryden or any of the wits of the present period that when jealousy is once declared nor poppy nor mandragora nor all the drowsy syrups of the east will ever soothe it or medicine it away <\s>
<s> in fine the symptoms seemed to be so alarming to this young physician who indeed young as he was had felt the kind pulses of all those dear kinsmen that harry thought it would be his duty to warn my lord mohun and let him know that his designs were suspected and watched <\s>
<s> so one day when in rather a pettish humor his lordship had sent to lady castlewood who had promised to drive with him and now refused to come harry said my lord if you will kindly give me a place by your side i will thank you i have much to say to you and would like to speak to you alone <\s>
<s> you honor me by giving me your confidence mr <\s>
<s> henry esmond says the other with a very grand bow <\s>
<s> my lord was always a fine gentleman and young as he was there was that in esmond's manner which showed that he was a gentleman too and that none might take a liberty with him so the pair went out and mounted the little carriage which was in waiting for them in the court with its two little cream colored hanoverian horses covered with splendid furniture and champing at the bit <\s>
<s> my lord says harry esmond after they were got into the country and pointing to my lord mohun's foot which was swathed in flannel and put up rather ostentatiously on a cushion my lord i studied medicine at cambridge <\s>
<s> indeed parson harry says he and are you going to take out a diploma and cure your fellow students of the of the gout says harry interrupting him and looking him hard in the face i know a good deal about the gout <\s>

<s> and he made a dreadful wry face as if he just felt a twinge <\s>

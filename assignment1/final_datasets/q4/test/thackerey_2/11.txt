<s> there was a hard touch for his grace and indeed for other generals in her majesty's service in the concluding sentence of the don that he and his council had the generous example of their ancestors to follow who had never yet sought their elevation in the blood or in the flight of their kings <\s>

<s> red says she tossing up her old head hath always been the color worn by the esmonds <\s>

<s> she would have him be dressed she said as became his father's son and paid cheerfully for his five pound beaver his black buckled periwig and his fine holland shirts and his swords and his pistols mounted with silver <\s>
<s> since the day he was born poor harry had never looked such a fine gentleman his liberal step mother filled his purse with guineas too some of which captain steele and a few choice spirits helped harry to spend in an entertainment which dick ordered and indeed would have paid for but that he had no money when the reckoning was called for nor would the landlord give him any more credit at the garter over against the gate of the palace in pall mall <\s>
<s> the old viscountess indeed if she had done esmond any wrong formerly seemed inclined to repair it by the present kindness of her behavior she embraced him copiously at parting wept plentifully bade him write by every packet and gave him an inestimable relic which she besought him to wear round his neck a medal blessed by i know not what pope and worn by his late sacred majesty king james <\s>

<s> there was a hard touch for his grace and indeed for other generals in her majesty's service in the concluding sentence of the don that he and his council had the generous example of their ancestors to follow who had never yet sought their elevation in the blood or in the flight of their kings <\s>

<s> red says she tossing up her old head hath always been the color worn by the esmonds <\s>

<s> she would have him be dressed she said as became his father's son and paid cheerfully for his five pound beaver his black buckled periwig and his fine holland shirts and his swords and his pistols mounted with silver <\s>
<s> since the day he was born poor harry had never looked such a fine gentleman his liberal step mother filled his purse with guineas too some of which captain steele and a few choice spirits helped harry to spend in an entertainment which dick ordered and indeed would have paid for but that he had no money when the reckoning was called for nor would the landlord give him any more credit at the garter over against the gate of the palace in pall mall <\s>
<s> the old viscountess indeed if she had done esmond any wrong formerly seemed inclined to repair it by the present kindness of her behavior she embraced him copiously at parting wept plentifully bade him write by every packet and gave him an inestimable relic which she besought him to wear round his neck a medal blessed by i know not what pope and worn by his late sacred majesty king james <\s>

<s> there was a hard touch for his grace and indeed for other generals in her majesty's service in the concluding sentence of the don that he and his council had the generous example of their ancestors to follow who had never yet sought their elevation in the blood or in the flight of their kings <\s>

<s> red says she tossing up her old head hath always been the color worn by the esmonds <\s>

<s> she would have him be dressed she said as became his father's son and paid cheerfully for his five pound beaver his black buckled periwig and his fine holland shirts and his swords and his pistols mounted with silver <\s>
<s> since the day he was born poor harry had never looked such a fine gentleman his liberal step mother filled his purse with guineas too some of which captain steele and a few choice spirits helped harry to spend in an entertainment which dick ordered and indeed would have paid for but that he had no money when the reckoning was called for nor would the landlord give him any more credit at the garter over against the gate of the palace in pall mall <\s>
<s> the old viscountess indeed if she had done esmond any wrong formerly seemed inclined to repair it by the present kindness of her behavior she embraced him copiously at parting wept plentifully bade him write by every packet and gave him an inestimable relic which she besought him to wear round his neck a medal blessed by i know not what pope and worn by his late sacred majesty king james <\s>

<s> there was a hard touch for his grace and indeed for other generals in her majesty's service in the concluding sentence of the don that he and his council had the generous example of their ancestors to follow who had never yet sought their elevation in the blood or in the flight of their kings <\s>

<s> red says she tossing up her old head hath always been the color worn by the esmonds <\s>

<s> she would have him be dressed she said as became his father's son and paid cheerfully for his five pound beaver his black buckled periwig and his fine holland shirts and his swords and his pistols mounted with silver <\s>
<s> since the day he was born poor harry had never looked such a fine gentleman his liberal step mother filled his purse with guineas too some of which captain steele and a few choice spirits helped harry to spend in an entertainment which dick ordered and indeed would have paid for but that he had no money when the reckoning was called for nor would the landlord give him any more credit at the garter over against the gate of the palace in pall mall <\s>
<s> the old viscountess indeed if she had done esmond any wrong formerly seemed inclined to repair it by the present kindness of her behavior she embraced him copiously at parting wept plentifully bade him write by every packet and gave him an inestimable relic which she besought him to wear round his neck a medal blessed by i know not what pope and worn by his late sacred majesty king james <\s>

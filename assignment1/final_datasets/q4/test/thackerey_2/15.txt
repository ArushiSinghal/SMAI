<s> esmond came in for a share of his chief's popularity and was presented to her majesty and advanced to the rank of lieutenant colonel at the request of his grateful chief <\s>
<s> we may be sure there was one family in which any good fortune that happened to esmond caused such a sincere pride and pleasure that he for his part was thankful he could make them so happy <\s>
<s> with these fond friends blenheim and oudenarde seemed to be mere trifling incidents of the war and wynendael was its crowning victory <\s>
<s> esmond's mistress never tired to hear accounts of the battle and i think general webb's lady grew jealous of her for the general was for ever at kensington and talking on that delightful theme <\s>
<s> as for his aide de camp though no doubt esmond's own natural vanity was pleased at the little share of reputation which his good fortune had won him yet it was chiefly precious to him he may say so now that he hath long since outlived it because it pleased his mistress and above all because beatrix valued it <\s>
<s> as for the old dowager of chelsey never was an old woman in all england more delighted nor more gracious than she <\s>
<s> esmond had his quarters in her ladyship's house where the domestics were instructed to consider him as their master <\s>
<s> she bade him give entertainments of which she defrayed the charges and was charmed when his guests were carried away tipsy in their coaches <\s>
<s> she must have his picture taken and accordingly he was painted by mr <\s>
<s> jervas in his red coat and smiling upon a bomb shell which was bursting at the corner of the piece <\s>
<s> she vowed that unless he made a great match she should never die easy and was for ever bringing young ladies to chelsey with pretty faces and pretty fortunes at the disposal of the colonel <\s>
<s> he smiled to think how times were altered with him and of the early days in his father's lifetime when a trembling page he stood before her with her ladyship's basin and ewer or crouched in her coach step <\s>
<s> the only fault she found with him was that he was more sober than an esmond ought to be and would neither be carried to bed by his valet nor lose his heart to any beauty whether of st <\s>

<s> what is the meaning of fidelity in love and whence the birth of it <\s>
<s> tis a state of mind that men fall into and depending on the man rather than the woman <\s>
<s> we love being in love that's the truth on't <\s>
<s> if we had not met joan we should have met kate and adored her <\s>
<s> we know our mistresses are no better than many other women nor no prettier nor no wiser nor no wittier <\s>
<s> tis not for these reasons we love a woman or for any special quality or charm i know of we might as well demand that a lady should be the tallest woman in the world like the shropshire giantess as that she should be a paragon in any other character before we began to love her <\s>
<s> esmond's mistress had a thousand faults beside her charms he knew both perfectly well <\s>
<s> she was imperious she was light minded she was flighty she was false she had no reverence in her character she was in everything even in beauty the contrast of her mother who was the most devoted and the least selfish of women <\s>
<s> well from the very first moment he saw her on the stairs at walcote esmond knew he loved beatrix <\s>
<s> there might be better women he wanted that one <\s>
<s> he cared for none other <\s>
<s> was it because she was gloriously beautiful <\s>
<s> beautiful as she was he had heard people say a score of times in their company that beatrix's mother looked as young and was the handsomer of the two <\s>
<s> why did her voice thrill in his ear so <\s>
<s> she could not sing near so well as nicolini or mrs <\s>
<s> tofts nay she sang out of tune and yet he liked to hear her better than st <\s>
<s> she had not a finer complexion than mrs <\s>
<s> steele dick's wife whom he had now got and who ruled poor dick with a rod of pickle and yet to see her dazzled esmond he would shut his eyes and the thought of her dazzled him all the same <\s>
<s> she was brilliant and lively in talk but not so incomparably witty as her mother who when she was cheerful said the finest things but yet to hear her and to be with her was esmond's greatest pleasure <\s>
<s> days passed away between him and these ladies he scarce knew how <\s>
<s> he poured his heart out to them so as he never could in any other company where he hath generally passed for being moody or supercilious and silent <\s>
<s> this society was more delightful than that of the greatest wits to him <\s>
<s> may heaven pardon him the lies he told the dowager at chelsey in order to get a pretext for going away to kensington the business at the ordnance which he invented the interview with his general the courts and statesmen's levees which he didn't frequent and describe who wore a new suit on sunday at st <\s>

<s> mistress beatrix esmond had been a dozen times on the point of making great matches so the court scandal said but for his part esmond never would believe the stories against her and came back after three years absence from her not so frantic as he had been perhaps but still hungering after her and no other still hopeful still kneeling with his heart in his hand for the young lady to take <\s>
<s> we were now got to 1709 <\s>
<s> she was near twenty two years old and three years at court and without a husband <\s>
<s> tis not for want of being asked lady castlewood said looking into esmond's heart as she could with that perceptiveness affection gives <\s>
<s> but she will make no mean match harry she will not marry as i would have her the person whom i should like to call my son and henry esmond knows who that is is best served by my not pressing his claim <\s>
<s> beatrix is so wilful that what i would urge on her she would be sure to resist <\s>
<s> the man who would marry her will not be happy with her unless he be a great person and can put her in a great position <\s>
<s> beatrix loves admiration more than love and longs beyond all things for command <\s>
<s> why should a mother speak so of her child <\s>
<s> you are my son too harry <\s>
<s> you should know the truth about your sister <\s>

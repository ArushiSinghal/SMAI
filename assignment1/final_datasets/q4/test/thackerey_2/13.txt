<s> captain holtz made a visit to england during this time so eager was he about negotiating prisoners and twas on returning from this voyage that he began to open himself more to esmond and to make him as occasion served at their various meetings several of those confidences which are here set down all together <\s>
<s> the reason of his increased confidence was this upon going to london the old director of esmond's aunt the dowager paid her ladyship a visit at chelsey and there learnt from her that captain esmond was acquainted with the secret of his family and was determined never to divulge it <\s>

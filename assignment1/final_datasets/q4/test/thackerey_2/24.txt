<s> we rode over castlewood downs before the breaking of dawn <\s>
<s> we passed the very spot where the car was upset fourteen years since and mohun lay <\s>
<s> the village was not up yet nor the forge lighted as we rode through it passing by the elms where the rooks were still roosting and by the church and over the bridge <\s>
<s> we got off our horses at the bridge and walked up to the gate <\s>
<s> if she is safe says frank trembling and his honest eyes filling with tears a silver statue to our lady <\s>
<s> he was going to rattle at the great iron knocker on the oak gate but esmond stopped his kinsman's hand <\s>
<s> he had his own fears his own hopes his own despairs and griefs too but he spoke not a word of these to his companion or showed any signs of emotion <\s>
<s> he went and tapped at the little window at the porter's lodge gently but repeatedly until the man came to the bars <\s>
<s> says he looking out it was the servant from kensington <\s>
<s> my lord castlewood and colonel esmond we said from below <\s>
<s> open the gate and let us in without any noise <\s>
<s> says the other my lord's here and in bed <\s>
<s> open d n you says castlewood with a curse <\s>
<s> i shall open to no one says the man shutting the glass window as frank drew a pistol <\s>
<s> he would have fired at the porter but esmond again held his hand <\s>
<s> there are more ways than one says he of entering such a great house as this <\s>
<s> frank grumbled that the west gate was half a mile round <\s>
<s> but i know of a way that's not a hundred yards off says mr <\s>
<s> esmond and leading his kinsman close along the wall and by the shrubs which had now grown thick on what had been an old moat about the house they came to the buttress at the side of which the little window was which was father holt's private door <\s>
<s> esmond climbed up to this easily broke a pane that had been mended and touched the spring inside and the two gentlemen passed in that way treading as lightly as they could and so going through the passage into the court over which the dawn was now reddening and where the fountain plashed in the silence <\s>
<s> they sped instantly to the porter's lodge where the fellow had not fastened his door that led into the court and pistol in hand came upon the terrified wretch and bade him be silent <\s>
<s> then they asked him esmond's head reeled and he almost fell as he spoke when lord castlewood had arrived <\s>
<s> he said on the previous evening about eight of the clock and what then his lordship supped with his sister did the man wait <\s>
<s> yes he and my lady's maid both waited the other servants made the supper and there was no wine and they could give his lordship but milk at which he grumbled and and madam beatrix kept miss lucy always in the room with her <\s>
<s> and there being a bed across the court in the chaplain's room she had arranged my lord was to sleep there <\s>
<s> madam beatrix had come down stairs laughing with the maids and had locked herself in and my lord had stood for a while talking to her through the door and she laughing at him <\s>
<s> and then he paced the court awhile and she came again to the upper window and my lord implored her to come down and walk in the room but she would not and laughed at him again and shut the window and so my lord uttering what seemed curses but in a foreign language went to the chaplain's room to bed <\s>
<s> was this all all the man swore upon his honor all as he hoped to be saved stop there was one thing more <\s>
<s> my lord on arriving and once or twice during supper did kiss his sister as was natural and she kissed him <\s>
<s> at this esmond ground his teeth with rage and wellnigh throttled the amazed miscreant who was speaking whereas castlewood seizing hold of his cousin's hand burst into a great fit of laughter <\s>
<s> if it amuses thee says esmond in french that your sister should be exchanging of kisses with a stranger i fear poor beatrix will give thee plenty of sport esmond darkly thought how hamilton ashburnham had before been masters of those roses that the young prince's lips were now feeding on <\s>
<s> he sickened at that notion <\s>
<s> her cheek was desecrated her beauty tarnished shame and honor stood between it and him <\s>
<s> the love was dead within him had she a crown to bring him with her love he felt that both would degrade him <\s>
<s> but this wrath against beatrix did not lessen the angry feelings of the colonel against the man who had been the occasion if not the cause of the evil <\s>
<s> frank sat down on a stone bench in the court yard and fairly fell asleep while esmond paced up and down the court debating what should ensue <\s>
<s> what mattered how much or how little had passed between the prince and the poor faithless girl <\s>
<s> they were arrived in time perhaps to rescue her person but not her mind had she not instigated the young prince to come to her suborned servants dismissed others so that she might communicate with him <\s>
<s> the treacherous heart within her had surrendered though the place was safe and it was to win this that he had given a life's struggle and devotion this that she was ready to give away for the bribe of a coronet or a wink of the prince's eye <\s>
<s> when he had thought his thoughts out he shook up poor frank from his sleep who rose yawning and said he had been dreaming of clotilda <\s>
<s> you must back me says esmond in what i am going to do <\s>
<s> i have been thinking that yonder scoundrel may have been instructed to tell that story and that the whole of it may be a lie if it be we shall find it out from the gentleman who is asleep yonder <\s>
<s> see if the door leading to my lady's rooms so we called the rooms at the north west angle of the house see if the door is barred as he saith <\s>
<s> we tried it was indeed as the lackey had said closed within <\s>
<s> it may have been opened and shut afterwards says poor esmond the foundress of our family let our ancestor in in that way <\s>
<s> what will you do harry if if what that fellow saith should turn out untrue <\s>
<s> the young man looked scared and frightened into his kinsman's face i dare say it wore no very pleasant expression <\s>
<s> let us first go see whether the two stories agree says esmond and went in at the passage and opened the door into what had been his own chamber now for wellnigh five and twenty years <\s>
<s> a candle was still burning and the prince asleep dressed on the bed esmond did not care for making a noise <\s>
<s> the prince started up in his bed seeing two men in his chamber <\s>
<s> qui est la says he and took a pistol from under his pillow <\s>
<s> it is the marquis of esmond says the colonel come to welcome his majesty to his house of castlewood and to report of what hath happened in london <\s>
<s> pursuant to the king's orders i passed the night before last after leaving his majesty in waiting upon the friends of the king <\s>
<s> it is a pity that his majesty's desire to see the country and to visit our poor house should have caused the king to quit london without notice yesterday when the opportunity happened which in all human probability may not occur again and had the king not chosen to ride to castlewood the prince of wales might have slept at st <\s>
<s> gentlemen says the prince starting off his bed whereon he was lying in his clothes the doctor was with me yesterday morning and after watching by my sister all night told me i might not hope to see the queen <\s>
<s> it would have been otherwise says esmond with another bow as by this time the queen may be dead in spite of the doctor <\s>
<s> the council was met a new treasurer was appointed the troops were devoted to the king's cause and fifty loyal gentlemen of the greatest names of this kingdom were assembled to accompany the prince of wales who might have been the acknowledged heir of the throne or the possessor of it by this time had your majesty not chosen to take the air <\s>
<s> we were ready there was only one person that failed us your majesty's gracious morbleu monsieur you give me too much majesty said the prince who had now risen up and seemed to be looking to one of us to help him to his coat <\s>
<s> we shall take care says esmond not much oftener to offend in that particular <\s>
<s> what mean you my lord <\s>
<s> says the prince and muttered something about a guet a pens which esmond caught up <\s>
<s> the snare sir said he was not of our laying it is not we that invited you <\s>
<s> we came to avenge and not to compass the dishonor of our family <\s>

<s> then he wearied of this jealousy then he broke away from it then came no doubt complaints and recriminations then perhaps promises of amendment not fulfilled then upbraidings not the more pleasant because they were silent and only sad looks and tearful eyes conveyed them <\s>

<s> to do him justice my lord never exacted this subservience he laughed and joked and drank his bottle and swore when he was angry much too familiarly for any one pretending to sublimity and did his best to destroy the ceremonial with which his wife chose to surround him <\s>

<s> to do him justice my lord never exacted this subservience he laughed and joked and drank his bottle and swore when he was angry much too familiarly for any one pretending to sublimity and did his best to destroy the ceremonial with which his wife chose to surround him <\s>
<s> and it required no great conceit on young esmond's part to see that his own brains were better than his patron's who indeed never assumed any airs of superiority over the lad or over any dependant of his save when he was displeased in which case he would express his mind in oaths very freely and who on the contrary perhaps spoiled parson harry as he called young esmond by constantly praising his parts and admiring his boyish stock of learning <\s>
<s> it may seem ungracious in one who has received a hundred favors from his patron to speak in any but a reverential manner of his elders but the present writer has had descendants of his own whom he has brought up with as little as possible of the servility at present exacted by parents from children under which mask of duty there often lurks indifference contempt or rebellion ): and as he would have his grandsons believe or represent him to be not an inch taller than nature has made him so with regard to his past acquaintances he would speak without anger but with truth as far as he knows it neither extenuating nor setting down aught in malice <\s>
<s> so long then as the world moved according to lord castlewood's wishes he was good humored enough of a temper naturally sprightly and easy liking to joke especially with his inferiors and charmed to receive the tribute of their laughter <\s>
<s> all exercises of the body he could perform to perfection shooting at a mark and flying breaking horses riding at the ring pitching the quoit playing at all games with great skill <\s>
<s> and not only did he do these things well but he thought he did them to perfection hence he was often tricked about horses which he pretended to know better than any jockey was made to play at ball and billiards by sharpers who took his money and came back from london wofully poorer each time than he went as the state of his affairs testified when the sudden accident came by which his career was brought to an end <\s>
<s> he was fond of the parade of dress and passed as many hours daily at his toilette as an elderly coquette <\s>
<s> a tenth part of his day was spent in the brushing of his teeth and the oiling of his hair which was curling and brown and which he did not like to conceal under a periwig such as almost everybody of that time wore <\s>
<s> we have the liberty of our hair back now but powder and pomatum along with it <\s>
<s> when i wonder will these monstrous poll taxes of our age be withdrawn and men allowed to carry their colors black red or gray as nature made them and as he liked her to be well dressed his lady spared no pains in that matter to please him indeed she would dress her head or cut it off if he had bidden her <\s>
<s> it was a wonder to young esmond serving as page to my lord and lady to hear day after day to such company as came the same boisterous stories told by my lord at which his lady never failed to smile or hold down her head and doctor tusher to burst out laughing at the proper point or cry fie my lord remember my cloth <\s>
<s> but with such a faint show of resistance that it only provoked my lord further <\s>
<s> lord castlewood's stories rose by degrees and became stronger after the ale at dinner and the bottle afterwards my lady always taking flight after the very first glass to church and king and leaving the gentlemen to drink the rest of the toasts by themselves <\s>
<s> and as harry esmond was her page he also was called from duty at this time <\s>
<s> my lord has lived in the army and with soldiers she would say to the lad amongst whom great license is allowed <\s>
<s> you have had a different nurture and i trust these things will change as you grow older not that any fault attaches to my lord who is one of the best and most religious men in this kingdom <\s>
<s> and very likely she believed so <\s>
<s> tis strange what a man may do and a woman yet think him an angel <\s>
<s> and as esmond has taken truth for his motto it must be owned even with regard to that other angel his mistress that she had a fault of character which flawed her perfections <\s>
<s> with the other sex perfectly tolerant and kindly of her own she was invariably jealous and a proof that she had this vice is that though she would acknowledge a thousand faults that she had not to this which she had she could never be got to own <\s>
<s> but if there came a woman with even a semblance of beauty to castlewood she was so sure to find out some wrong in her that my lord laughing in his jolly way would often joke with her concerning her foible <\s>
<s> comely servant maids might come for hire but none were taken at castlewood <\s>
<s> the housekeeper was old my lady's own waiting woman squinted and was marked with the small pox the housemaids and scullion were ordinary country wenches to whom lady castlewood was kind as her nature made her to everybody almost but as soon as ever she had to do with a pretty woman she was cold retiring and haughty <\s>
<s> the country ladies found this fault in her and though the men all admired her their wives and daughters complained of her coldness and aims and said that castlewood was pleasanter in lady jezebel's time as the dowager was called than at present <\s>
<s> some few were of my mistress's side <\s>
<s> old lady blenkinsop jointure who had been at court in king james the first's time always took her side and so did old mistress crookshank bishop crookshank's daughter of hexton who with some more of their like pronounced my lady an angel but the pretty women were not of this mind and the opinion of the country was that my lord was tied to his wife's apron strings and that she ruled over him <\s>
<s> the second fight which harry esmond had was at fourteen years of age with bryan hawkshaw sir john hawkshaw's son of bramblebrook who advancing this opinion that my lady was jealous and henpecked my lord put harry in such a fury that harry fell on him and with such rage that the other boy who was two years older and by far bigger than he had by far the worst of the assault until it was interrupted by doctor tusher walking out of the dinner room <\s>
<s> bryan hawkshaw got up bleeding at the nose having indeed been surprised as many a stronger man might have been by the fury of the assault upon him <\s>

<s> holt was a casuist both dexterous and learned and presented the case between the english church and his own in such a way that those who granted his premises ought certainly to allow his conclusions <\s>
<s> he touched on esmond's delicate state of health chance of dissolution and so forth and enlarged upon the immense benefits that the sick man was likely to forego benefits which the church of england did not deny to those of the roman communion as how should she being derived from that church and only an offshoot from it <\s>

<s> but if the good father meant that esmond should join the roman communion for fear of consequences and that all england ran the risk of being damned for heresy esmond for one was perfectly willing to take his chance of the penalty along with the countless millions of his fellow countrymen who were bred in the same faith and along with some of the noblest the truest the purest the wisest the most pious and learned men and women in the world <\s>

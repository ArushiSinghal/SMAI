<s> then we shall call for cards and there will be probably a difference over the cards and then god help us either a wicked villain and traitor shall go out of the world or a poor worthless devil that doesn't care to remain in it <\s>
<s> i am better away hal my wife will be all the happier when i am gone says my lord with a groan that tore the heart of harry esmond so that he fairly broke into a sob over his patron's kind hand <\s>
<s> the business was talked over with mohun before he left home castlewood i mean my lord went on <\s>
<s> i took the letter in to him which i had read and i charged him with his villainy and he could make no denial of it only he said that my wife was innocent <\s>
<s> and so she is before heaven my lord she is <\s>
<s> no doubt no doubt <\s>
<s> they always are says my lord <\s>
<s> no doubt when she heard he was killed she fainted from accident <\s>
<s> but my lord my name is harry cried out esmond burning red <\s>
<s> you told my lady harry was killed damnation <\s>
<s> shall i fight you too <\s>
<s> shouts my lord in a fury <\s>
<s> are you you little serpent warmed by my fire going to sting you no my boy you're an honest boy you are a good boy <\s>
<s> and here he broke from rage into tears even more cruel to see you are an honest boy and i love you and by heavens i am so wretched that i don't care what sword it is that ends me <\s>
<s> stop here's jack westbury <\s>
<s> this is my kinsman harry esmond <\s>
<s> who brought your bowls for you at castlewood sir <\s>
<s> says harry bowing and the three gentlemen sat down and drank of that bottle of sack which was prepared for them <\s>
<s> harry is number three says my lord <\s>
<s> you needn't be afraid of him jack <\s>
<s> and the colonel gave a look as much as to say indeed he don't look as if i need <\s>
<s> and then my lord explained what he had only told by hints before <\s>
<s> when he quarrelled with lord mohun he was indebted to his lordship in a sum of sixteen hundred pounds for which lord mohun said he proposed to wait until my lord viscount should pay him <\s>
<s> my lord had raised the sixteen hundred pounds and sent them to lord mohun that morning and before quitting home had put his affairs into order and was now quite ready to abide the issue of the quarrel <\s>
<s> when we had drunk a couple of bottles of sack a coach was called and the three gentlemen went to the duke's playhouse as agreed <\s>
<s> the play was one of mr <\s>
<s> wycherley's love in a wood <\s>
<s> harry esmond has thought of that play ever since with a kind of terror and of mrs <\s>
<s> bracegirdle the actress who performed the girl's part in the comedy <\s>
<s> she was disguised as a page and came and stood before the gentlemen as they sat on the stage and looked over her shoulder with a pair of arch black eyes and laughed at my lord and asked what ailed the gentleman from the country and had he had bad news from bullock fair <\s>
<s> between the acts of the play the gentlemen crossed over and conversed freely <\s>
<s> there were two of lord mohun's party captain macartney in a military habit and a gentleman in a suit of blue velvet and silver in a fair periwig with a rich fall of point of venice lace my lord the earl of warwick and holland <\s>
<s> my lord had a paper of oranges which he ate and offered to the actresses joking with them <\s>
<s> bracegirdle when my lord mohun said something rude turned on him and asked him what he did there and whether he and his friends had come to stab anybody else as they did poor will mountford <\s>
<s> my lord's dark face grew darker at this taunt and wore a mischievous fatal look <\s>
<s> they that saw it remembered it and said so afterward <\s>
<s> when the play was ended the two parties joined company and my lord castlewood then proposed that they should go to a tavern and sup <\s>
<s> lockit's the greyhound in charing cross was the house selected <\s>
<s> all six marched together that way the three lords going a head lord mohun's captain and colonel westbury and harry esmond walking behind them <\s>

<s> and in a lower tone westbury besought young mr <\s>
<s> esmond to take no part in the quarrel <\s>
<s> there was no need for more seconds than one said the colonel and the captain or lord warwick might easily withdraw <\s>
<s> but harry said no he was bent on going through with the business <\s>
<s> indeed he had a plan in his head which he thought might prevent my lord viscount from engaging <\s>

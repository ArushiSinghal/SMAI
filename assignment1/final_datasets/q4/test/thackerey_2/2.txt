<s> the mother's natural pang at losing this poor little child must have been increased when she thought of her rival frank esmond's wife who was a favorite of the whole court where my poor lady castlewood was neglected and who had one child a daughter flourishing and beautiful and was about to become a mother once more <\s>
<s> the court as i have heard only laughed the more because the poor lady who had pretty well passed the age when ladies are accustomed to have children nevertheless determined not to give hope up and even when she came to live at castlewood was constantly sending over to hexton for the doctor and announcing to her friends the arrival of an heir <\s>
<s> this absurdity of hers was one amongst many others which the wags used to play upon <\s>
<s> indeed to the last days of her life my lady viscountess had the comfort of fancying herself beautiful and persisted in blooming up to the very midst of winter painting roses on her cheeks long after their natural season and attiring herself like summer though her head was covered with snow <\s>
<s> gentlemen who were about the court of king charles and king james have told the present writer a number of stories about this queer old lady with which it's not necessary that posterity should be entertained <\s>
<s> she is said to have had great powers of invective and if she fought with all her rivals in king james's favor tis certain she must have had a vast number of quarrels on her hands <\s>
<s> she was a woman of an intrepid spirit and it appears pursued and rather fatigued his majesty with her rights and her wrongs <\s>
<s> some say that the cause of her leaving court was jealousy of frank esmond's wife others that she was forced to retreat after a great battle which took place at whitehall between her ladyship and lady dorchester tom killigrew's daughter whom the king delighted to honor and in which that ill favored esther got the better of our elderly vashti <\s>
<s> but her ladyship for her part always averred that it was her husband's quarrel and not her own which occasioned the banishment of the two into the country and the cruel ingratitude of the sovereign in giving away out of the family that place of warden of the butteries and groom of the king's posset which the two last lords castlewood had held so honorably and which was now conferred upon a fellow of yesterday and a hanger on of that odious dorchester creature my lord bergamot i never said my lady could have come to see his majesty's posset carried by any other hand than an esmond <\s>
<s> i should have dashed the salver out of lord bergamot's hand had i met him <\s>
<s> and those who knew her ladyship are aware that she was a person quite capable of performing this feat had she not wisely kept out of the way <\s>

<s> holding the purse strings in her own control to which indeed she liked to bring most persons who came near her lady castlewood could command her husband's obedience and so broke up her establishment at london she had removed from lincoln's inn fields to chelsey to a pretty new house she bought there and brought her establishment her maids lap dogs and gentlewomen her priest and his lordship her husband to castlewood hall that she had never seen since she quitted it as a child with her father during the troubles of king charles the first's reign <\s>
<s> the walls were still open in the old house as they had been left by the shot of the commonwealthmen <\s>
<s> a part of the mansion was restored and furbished up with the plate hangings and furniture brought from the house in london <\s>
<s> my lady meant to have a triumphal entry into castlewood village and expected the people to cheer as she drove over the green in her great coach my lord beside her her gentlewomen lap dogs and cockatoos on the opposite seat six horses to her carriage and servants armed and mounted following it and preceding it <\s>
<s> but twas in the height of the no popery cry the folks in the village and the neighboring town were scared by the sight of her ladyship's painted face and eyelids as she bobbed her head out of the coach window meaning no doubt to be very gracious and one old woman said lady isabel <\s>
<s> lord a mercy it's lady jezebel <\s>
<s> a name by which the enemies of the right honorable viscountess were afterwards in the habit of designating her <\s>
<s> the country was then in a great no popery fervor her ladyship's known conversion and her husband's the priest in her train and the service performed at the chapel of castlewood though the chapel had been built for that worship before any other was heard of in the country and though the service was performed in the most quiet manner got her no favor at first in the county or village <\s>
<s> by far the greater part of the estate of castlewood had been confiscated and been parcelled out to commonwealthmen <\s>
<s> one or two of these old cromwellian soldiers were still alive in the village and looked grimly at first upon my lady viscountess when she came to dwell there <\s>
<s> she appeared at the hexton assembly bringing her lord after her scaring the country folks with the splendor of her diamonds which she always wore in public <\s>
<s> they said she wore them in private too and slept with them round her neck though the writer can pledge his word that this was a calumny <\s>
<s> if she were to take them off my lady sark said tom esmond her husband would run away with them and pawn them <\s>

<s> as for my lord he gave no great trouble being considered scarce more than an appendage to my lady who as daughter of the old lords of castlewood and possessor of vast wealth as the country folks said though indeed nine tenths of it existed but in rumor was looked upon as the real queen of the castle and mistress of all it contained <\s>

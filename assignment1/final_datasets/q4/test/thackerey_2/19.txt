<s> so would graveairs here have made something out of our name if he had represented it <\s>
<s> my lord graveairs would have done very well <\s>
<s> yes you have a very pretty way and would have made a very decent grave speaker <\s>
<s> and here she began to imitate esmond's way of carrying himself and speaking to his face and so ludicrously that his mistress burst out a laughing and even he himself could see there was some likeness in the fantastical malicious caricature <\s>
<s> yes says she i solemnly vow own and confess that i want a good husband <\s>

<s> says pompey a little grinning negro lord peterborrow gave her with a bird of paradise in his turbant and a collar with his mistress's name on it <\s>
<s> says beatrix imitating the child <\s>
<s> and if husband not come pompey must go fetch one <\s>
<s> and pompey went away grinning with his chocolate tray as miss beatrix ran up to her mother and ended her sally of mischief in her common way with a kiss no wonder that upon paying such a penalty her fond judge pardoned her <\s>
<s> esmond came home his health was still shattered and he took a lodging near to his mistresses at kensington glad enough to be served by them and to see them day after day <\s>

<s> addison both did him the honor to visit him and drank many a glass of good claret at his lodging whilst their entertainer through his wound was kept to diet drink and gruel <\s>
<s> these gentlemen were whigs and great admirers of my lord duke of marlborough and esmond was entirely of the other party <\s>
<s> but their different views of politics did not prevent the gentlemen from agreeing in private nor from allowing on one evening when esmond's kind old patron lieutenant general webb with a stick and a crutch hobbled up to the colonel's lodging which was prettily situate at knightsbridge between london and kensington and looking over the gardens that the lieutenant general was a noble and gallant soldier and even that he had been hardly used in the wynendael affair <\s>
<s> he took his revenge in talk that must be confessed and if mr <\s>
<s> addison had had a mind to write a poem about wynendael he might have heard from the commander's own lips the story a hundred times over <\s>
<s> esmond forced to be quiet betook himself to literature for a relaxation and composed his comedy whereof the prompter's copy lieth in my walnut escritoire sealed up and docketed the faithful fool a comedy as it was performed by her majesty's servants <\s>
<s> twas a very sentimental piece and mr <\s>
<s> steele who had more of that kind of sentiment than mr <\s>
<s> addison admired it whilst the other rather sneered at the performance though he owned that here and there it contained some pretty strokes <\s>
<s> he was bringing out his own play of cato at the time the blaze of which quite extinguished esmond's farthing candle and his name was never put to the piece which was printed as by a person of quality <\s>
<s> only nine copies were sold though mr <\s>
<s> dennis the great critic praised it and said twas a work of great merit and colonel esmond had the whole impression burned one day in a rage by jack lockwood his man <\s>
<s> all this comedy was full of bitter satiric strokes against a certain young lady <\s>
<s> the plot of the piece was quite a new one <\s>
<s> a young woman was represented with a great number of suitors selecting a pert fribble of a peer in place of the hero but ill acted i think by mr <\s>
<s> wilks the faithful fool who persisted in admiring her <\s>
<s> in the fifth act teraminta was made to discover the merits of eugenio the f <\s>
<s> f and to feel a partiality for him too late for he announced that he had bestowed his hand and estate upon rosaria a country lass endowed with every virtue <\s>
<s> but it must be owned that the audience yawned through the play and that it perished on the third night with only half a dozen persons to behold its agonies <\s>
<s> esmond and his two mistresses came to the first night and miss beatrix fell asleep whilst her mother who had not been to a play since king james the second's time thought the piece though not brilliant had a very pretty moral <\s>
<s> esmond dabbled in letters and wrote a deal of prose and verse at this time of leisure <\s>
<s> when displeased with the conduct of miss beatrix he would compose a satire in which he relieved his mind <\s>
<s> when smarting under the faithlessness of women he dashed off a copy of verses in which he held the whole sex up to scorn <\s>
<s> one day in one of these moods he made a little joke in which swearing him to secrecy he got his friend dick steele to help him and composing a paper he had it printed exactly like steele's paper and by his printer and laid on his mistress's breakfast table the following spectator <\s>

<s> jocasta's acquaintance is thus very numerous <\s>

<s> either at epsom wells or at tunbridge for of this important matter jocasta cannot be certain it was her ladyship's fortune to become acquainted with a young gentleman whose conversation was so sprightly and manners amiable that she invited the agreeable young spark to visit her if ever he came to london where her house in spring garden should be open to him <\s>
<s> charming as he was and without any manner of doubt a pretty fellow jocasta hath such a regiment of the like continually marching round her standard that tis no wonder her attention is distracted amongst them <\s>

<s> but his spirit was so high that those who wished his death knew that his courage was like his charity and never turned any man away and he died by the hands of mohun and the other two cut throats that were set on him <\s>

<s> the death of mohun her husband's murderer was more awful to my mistress than even the duke's unhappy end <\s>

<s> mohun asked my lord duke where he could see his grace's friends and within an hour had sent two of his own to arrange this deadly duel <\s>
<s> it was pursued with such fierceness and sprung from so trifling a cause that all men agreed at the time that there was a party of which these three notorious brawlers were but agents who desired to take duke hamilton's life away <\s>
<s> they fought three on a side as in that tragic meeting twelve years back which hath been recounted already and in which mohun performed his second murder <\s>
<s> they rushed in and closed upon each other at once without any feints or crossing of swords even and stabbed one at the other desperately each receiving many wounds and mohun having his death wound and my lord duke lying by him macartney came up and stabbed his grace as he lay on the ground and gave him the blow of which he died <\s>
<s> colonel macartney denied this of which the horror and indignation of the whole kingdom would nevertheless have him guilty and fled the country whither he never returned <\s>
<s> what was the real cause of the duke hamilton's death a paltry quarrel that might easily have been made up and with a ruffian so low base profligate and degraded with former crimes and repeated murders that a man of such renown and princely rank as my lord duke might have disdained to sully his sword with the blood of such a villain <\s>
<s> but his spirit was so high that those who wished his death knew that his courage was like his charity and never turned any man away and he died by the hands of mohun and the other two cut throats that were set on him <\s>
<s> the queen's ambassador to paris died the loyal and devoted servant of the house of stuart and a royal prince of scotland himself and carrying the confidence the repentance of queen anne along with his own open devotion and the good will of millions in the country more to the queen's exiled brother and sovereign <\s>
<s> that party to which lord mohun belonged had the benefit of his service and now were well rid of such a ruffian <\s>
<s> he and meredith and macartney were the duke of marlborough's men and the two colonels had been broke but the year before for drinking perdition to the tories <\s>
<s> his grace was a whig now and a hanoverian and as eager for war as prince eugene himself <\s>
<s> i say not that he was privy to duke hamilton's death i say that his party profited by it and that three desperate and bloody instruments were found to effect that murder <\s>
<s> as esmond and the dean walked away from kensington discoursing of this tragedy and how fatal it was to the cause which they both had at heart the street criers were already out with their broadsides shouting through the town the full true and horrible account of the death of lord mohun and duke hamilton in a duel <\s>
<s> a fellow had got to kensington and was crying it in the square there at very early morning when mr <\s>
<s> esmond happened to pass by <\s>
<s> he drove the man from under beatrix's very window whereof the casement had been set open <\s>
<s> the sun was shining though twas november he had seen the market carts rolling into london the guard relieved at the palace the laborers trudging to their work in the gardens between kensington and the city the wandering merchants and hawkers filling the air with their cries <\s>
<s> the world was going to its business again although dukes lay dead and ladies mourned for them and kings very likely lost their chances <\s>
<s> so night and day pass away and to morrow comes and our place knows us not <\s>
<s> esmond thought of the courier now galloping on the north road to inform him who was earl of arran yesterday that he was duke of hamilton to day and of a thousand great schemes hopes ambitions that were alive in the gallant heart beating a few hours since and now in a little dust quiescent <\s>
<s> i visit castlewood once more <\s>
<s> thus for a third time beatrix's ambitious hopes were circumvented and she might well believe that a special malignant fate watched and pursued her tearing her prize out of her hand just as she seemed to grasp it and leaving her with only rage and grief for her portion <\s>
<s> whatever her feelings might have been of anger or of sorrow and i fear me that the former emotion was that which most tore her heart she would take no confidant as people of softer natures would have done under such a calamity her mother and her kinsman knew that she would disdain their pity and that to offer it would be but to infuriate the cruel wound which fortune had inflicted <\s>
<s> no duke hamilton is dead he was murdered an hour ago by mohun and macartney they had a quarrel this morning they gave him not so much time as to write a letter <\s>
<s> he went for a couple of his friends and he is dead and mohun too the bloody villain who was set on him <\s>

<s> oh beatrix beatrix thought esmond and here ends my poor girl's ambition <\s>
<s> there had been no need to urge upon esmond the necessity of a separation between him and beatrix fate had done that completely and i think from the very moment poor beatrix had accepted the duke's offer she began to assume the majestic air of a duchess nay queen elect and to carry herself as one sacred and removed from us common people <\s>
<s> her mother and kinsman both fell into her ways the latter scornfully perhaps and uttering his usual gibes at her vanity and his own <\s>
<s> there was a certain charm about this girl of which neither colonel esmond nor his fond mistress could forego the fascination in spite of her faults and her pride and wilfulness they were forced to love her and indeed might be set down as the two chief flatterers of the brilliant creature's court <\s>
<s> who in the course of his life hath not been so bewitched and worshipped some idol or another <\s>
<s> years after this passion hath been dead and buried along with a thousand other worldly cares and ambitions he who felt it can recall it out of its grave and admire almost as fondly as he did in his youth that lovely queenly creature <\s>
<s> i invoke that beautiful spirit from the shades and love her still or rather i should say such a past is always present to a man such a passion once felt forms a part of his whole being and cannot be separated from it it becomes a portion of the man of to day just as any great faith or conviction the discovery of poetry the awakening of religion ever afterwards influence him just as the wound i had at blenheim and of which i wear the scar hath become part of my frame and influenced my whole body nay spirit subsequently though twas got and healed forty years ago <\s>

<s> for days before her chariot had been rolling the street from mercer to toyshop from goldsmith to laceman her taste was perfect or at least the fond bridegroom had thought so and had given her entire authority over all tradesmen and for all the plate furniture and equipages with which his grace the ambassador wished to adorn his splendid mission <\s>

<s> colonel macartney denied this of which the horror and indignation of the whole kingdom would nevertheless have him guilty and fled the country whither he never returned <\s>
<s> what was the real cause of the duke hamilton's death a paltry quarrel that might easily have been made up and with a ruffian so low base profligate and degraded with former crimes and repeated murders that a man of such renown and princely rank as my lord duke might have disdained to sully his sword with the blood of such a villain <\s>
<s> but his spirit was so high that those who wished his death knew that his courage was like his charity and never turned any man away and he died by the hands of mohun and the other two cut throats that were set on him <\s>

<s> as esmond and the dean walked away from kensington discoursing of this tragedy and how fatal it was to the cause which they both had at heart the street criers were already out with their broadsides shouting through the town the full true and horrible account of the death of lord mohun and duke hamilton in a duel <\s>

<s> no duke hamilton is dead he was murdered an hour ago by mohun and macartney they had a quarrel this morning they gave him not so much time as to write a letter <\s>

<s> the death of mohun her husband's murderer was more awful to my mistress than even the duke's unhappy end <\s>

<s> they had met by appointment that day at the lawyer's in lincoln's inn fields had words which though they appeared very trifling to those who heard them were not so to men exasperated by long and previous enmity <\s>
<s> mohun asked my lord duke where he could see his grace's friends and within an hour had sent two of his own to arrange this deadly duel <\s>
<s> it was pursued with such fierceness and sprung from so trifling a cause that all men agreed at the time that there was a party of which these three notorious brawlers were but agents who desired to take duke hamilton's life away <\s>
<s> they fought three on a side as in that tragic meeting twelve years back which hath been recounted already and in which mohun performed his second murder <\s>
<s> they rushed in and closed upon each other at once without any feints or crossing of swords even and stabbed one at the other desperately each receiving many wounds and mohun having his death wound and my lord duke lying by him macartney came up and stabbed his grace as he lay on the ground and gave him the blow of which he died <\s>
<s> colonel macartney denied this of which the horror and indignation of the whole kingdom would nevertheless have him guilty and fled the country whither he never returned <\s>
<s> what was the real cause of the duke hamilton's death a paltry quarrel that might easily have been made up and with a ruffian so low base profligate and degraded with former crimes and repeated murders that a man of such renown and princely rank as my lord duke might have disdained to sully his sword with the blood of such a villain <\s>
<s> but his spirit was so high that those who wished his death knew that his courage was like his charity and never turned any man away and he died by the hands of mohun and the other two cut throats that were set on him <\s>
<s> the queen's ambassador to paris died the loyal and devoted servant of the house of stuart and a royal prince of scotland himself and carrying the confidence the repentance of queen anne along with his own open devotion and the good will of millions in the country more to the queen's exiled brother and sovereign <\s>
<s> that party to which lord mohun belonged had the benefit of his service and now were well rid of such a ruffian <\s>
<s> he and meredith and macartney were the duke of marlborough's men and the two colonels had been broke but the year before for drinking perdition to the tories <\s>

<s> i say not that he was privy to duke hamilton's death i say that his party profited by it and that three desperate and bloody instruments were found to effect that murder <\s>
<s> as esmond and the dean walked away from kensington discoursing of this tragedy and how fatal it was to the cause which they both had at heart the street criers were already out with their broadsides shouting through the town the full true and horrible account of the death of lord mohun and duke hamilton in a duel <\s>
<s> a fellow had got to kensington and was crying it in the square there at very early morning when mr <\s>
<s> esmond happened to pass by <\s>

<s> the sun was shining though twas november he had seen the market carts rolling into london the guard relieved at the palace the laborers trudging to their work in the gardens between kensington and the city the wandering merchants and hawkers filling the air with their cries <\s>
<s> the world was going to its business again although dukes lay dead and ladies mourned for them and kings very likely lost their chances <\s>
<s> so night and day pass away and to morrow comes and our place knows us not <\s>
<s> esmond thought of the courier now galloping on the north road to inform him who was earl of arran yesterday that he was duke of hamilton to day and of a thousand great schemes hopes ambitions that were alive in the gallant heart beating a few hours since and now in a little dust quiescent <\s>
<s> i visit castlewood once more <\s>
<s> thus for a third time beatrix's ambitious hopes were circumvented and she might well believe that a special malignant fate watched and pursued her tearing her prize out of her hand just as she seemed to grasp it and leaving her with only rage and grief for her portion <\s>
<s> whatever her feelings might have been of anger or of sorrow and i fear me that the former emotion was that which most tore her heart she would take no confidant as people of softer natures would have done under such a calamity her mother and her kinsman knew that she would disdain their pity and that to offer it would be but to infuriate the cruel wound which fortune had inflicted <\s>
<s> no duke hamilton is dead he was murdered an hour ago by mohun and macartney they had a quarrel this morning they gave him not so much time as to write a letter <\s>

<s> i have your chariot below send to every part of the country and apprehend that villain come to the duke's house and see if any life be left in him <\s>
<s> oh beatrix beatrix thought esmond and here ends my poor girl's ambition <\s>
<s> there had been no need to urge upon esmond the necessity of a separation between him and beatrix fate had done that completely and i think from the very moment poor beatrix had accepted the duke's offer she began to assume the majestic air of a duchess nay queen elect and to carry herself as one sacred and removed from us common people <\s>
<s> her mother and kinsman both fell into her ways the latter scornfully perhaps and uttering his usual gibes at her vanity and his own <\s>
<s> there was a certain charm about this girl of which neither colonel esmond nor his fond mistress could forego the fascination in spite of her faults and her pride and wilfulness they were forced to love her and indeed might be set down as the two chief flatterers of the brilliant creature's court <\s>
<s> who in the course of his life hath not been so bewitched and worshipped some idol or another <\s>
<s> years after this passion hath been dead and buried along with a thousand other worldly cares and ambitions he who felt it can recall it out of its grave and admire almost as fondly as he did in his youth that lovely queenly creature <\s>
<s> i invoke that beautiful spirit from the shades and love her still or rather i should say such a past is always present to a man such a passion once felt forms a part of his whole being and cannot be separated from it it becomes a portion of the man of to day just as any great faith or conviction the discovery of poetry the awakening of religion ever afterwards influence him just as the wound i had at blenheim and of which i wear the scar hath become part of my frame and influenced my whole body nay spirit subsequently though twas got and healed forty years ago <\s>

<s> for days before her chariot had been rolling the street from mercer to toyshop from goldsmith to laceman her taste was perfect or at least the fond bridegroom had thought so and had given her entire authority over all tradesmen and for all the plate furniture and equipages with which his grace the ambassador wished to adorn his splendid mission <\s>

<s> colonel macartney denied this of which the horror and indignation of the whole kingdom would nevertheless have him guilty and fled the country whither he never returned <\s>
<s> what was the real cause of the duke hamilton's death a paltry quarrel that might easily have been made up and with a ruffian so low base profligate and degraded with former crimes and repeated murders that a man of such renown and princely rank as my lord duke might have disdained to sully his sword with the blood of such a villain <\s>
<s> but his spirit was so high that those who wished his death knew that his courage was like his charity and never turned any man away and he died by the hands of mohun and the other two cut throats that were set on him <\s>
<s> the queen's ambassador to paris died the loyal and devoted servant of the house of stuart and a royal prince of scotland himself and carrying the confidence the repentance of queen anne along with his own open devotion and the good will of millions in the country more to the queen's exiled brother and sovereign <\s>
<s> that party to which lord mohun belonged had the benefit of his service and now were well rid of such a ruffian <\s>

<s> i say not that he was privy to duke hamilton's death i say that his party profited by it and that three desperate and bloody instruments were found to effect that murder <\s>
<s> as esmond and the dean walked away from kensington discoursing of this tragedy and how fatal it was to the cause which they both had at heart the street criers were already out with their broadsides shouting through the town the full true and horrible account of the death of lord mohun and duke hamilton in a duel <\s>
<s> a fellow had got to kensington and was crying it in the square there at very early morning when mr <\s>

<s> the world was going to its business again although dukes lay dead and ladies mourned for them and kings very likely lost their chances <\s>
<s> so night and day pass away and to morrow comes and our place knows us not <\s>

<s> i visit castlewood once more <\s>

<s> whatever her feelings might have been of anger or of sorrow and i fear me that the former emotion was that which most tore her heart she would take no confidant as people of softer natures would have done under such a calamity her mother and her kinsman knew that she would disdain their pity and that to offer it would be but to infuriate the cruel wound which fortune had inflicted <\s>
<s> no duke hamilton is dead he was murdered an hour ago by mohun and macartney they had a quarrel this morning they gave him not so much time as to write a letter <\s>

<s> oh beatrix beatrix thought esmond and here ends my poor girl's ambition <\s>
<s> there had been no need to urge upon esmond the necessity of a separation between him and beatrix fate had done that completely and i think from the very moment poor beatrix had accepted the duke's offer she began to assume the majestic air of a duchess nay queen elect and to carry herself as one sacred and removed from us common people <\s>
<s> her mother and kinsman both fell into her ways the latter scornfully perhaps and uttering his usual gibes at her vanity and his own <\s>
<s> there was a certain charm about this girl of which neither colonel esmond nor his fond mistress could forego the fascination in spite of her faults and her pride and wilfulness they were forced to love her and indeed might be set down as the two chief flatterers of the brilliant creature's court <\s>

<s> years after this passion hath been dead and buried along with a thousand other worldly cares and ambitions he who felt it can recall it out of its grave and admire almost as fondly as he did in his youth that lovely queenly creature <\s>
<s> i invoke that beautiful spirit from the shades and love her still or rather i should say such a past is always present to a man such a passion once felt forms a part of his whole being and cannot be separated from it it becomes a portion of the man of to day just as any great faith or conviction the discovery of poetry the awakening of religion ever afterwards influence him just as the wound i had at blenheim and of which i wear the scar hath become part of my frame and influenced my whole body nay spirit subsequently though twas got and healed forty years ago <\s>

<s> but his spirit was so high that those who wished his death knew that his courage was like his charity and never turned any man away and he died by the hands of mohun and the other two cut throats that were set on him <\s>

<s> they rushed in and closed upon each other at once without any feints or crossing of swords even and stabbed one at the other desperately each receiving many wounds and mohun having his death wound and my lord duke lying by him macartney came up and stabbed his grace as he lay on the ground and gave him the blow of which he died <\s>
<s> colonel macartney denied this of which the horror and indignation of the whole kingdom would nevertheless have him guilty and fled the country whither he never returned <\s>
<s> what was the real cause of the duke hamilton's death a paltry quarrel that might easily have been made up and with a ruffian so low base profligate and degraded with former crimes and repeated murders that a man of such renown and princely rank as my lord duke might have disdained to sully his sword with the blood of such a villain <\s>
<s> but his spirit was so high that those who wished his death knew that his courage was like his charity and never turned any man away and he died by the hands of mohun and the other two cut throats that were set on him <\s>

<s> that party to which lord mohun belonged had the benefit of his service and now were well rid of such a ruffian <\s>

<s> i say not that he was privy to duke hamilton's death i say that his party profited by it and that three desperate and bloody instruments were found to effect that murder <\s>
<s> as esmond and the dean walked away from kensington discoursing of this tragedy and how fatal it was to the cause which they both had at heart the street criers were already out with their broadsides shouting through the town the full true and horrible account of the death of lord mohun and duke hamilton in a duel <\s>
<s> a fellow had got to kensington and was crying it in the square there at very early morning when mr <\s>

<s> the sun was shining though twas november he had seen the market carts rolling into london the guard relieved at the palace the laborers trudging to their work in the gardens between kensington and the city the wandering merchants and hawkers filling the air with their cries <\s>
<s> the world was going to its business again although dukes lay dead and ladies mourned for them and kings very likely lost their chances <\s>
<s> so night and day pass away and to morrow comes and our place knows us not <\s>

<s> i visit castlewood once more <\s>

<s> whatever her feelings might have been of anger or of sorrow and i fear me that the former emotion was that which most tore her heart she would take no confidant as people of softer natures would have done under such a calamity her mother and her kinsman knew that she would disdain their pity and that to offer it would be but to infuriate the cruel wound which fortune had inflicted <\s>
<s> no duke hamilton is dead he was murdered an hour ago by mohun and macartney they had a quarrel this morning they gave him not so much time as to write a letter <\s>

<s> oh beatrix beatrix thought esmond and here ends my poor girl's ambition <\s>
<s> there had been no need to urge upon esmond the necessity of a separation between him and beatrix fate had done that completely and i think from the very moment poor beatrix had accepted the duke's offer she began to assume the majestic air of a duchess nay queen elect and to carry herself as one sacred and removed from us common people <\s>
<s> her mother and kinsman both fell into her ways the latter scornfully perhaps and uttering his usual gibes at her vanity and his own <\s>
<s> there was a certain charm about this girl of which neither colonel esmond nor his fond mistress could forego the fascination in spite of her faults and her pride and wilfulness they were forced to love her and indeed might be set down as the two chief flatterers of the brilliant creature's court <\s>

<s> years after this passion hath been dead and buried along with a thousand other worldly cares and ambitions he who felt it can recall it out of its grave and admire almost as fondly as he did in his youth that lovely queenly creature <\s>
<s> i invoke that beautiful spirit from the shades and love her still or rather i should say such a past is always present to a man such a passion once felt forms a part of his whole being and cannot be separated from it it becomes a portion of the man of to day just as any great faith or conviction the discovery of poetry the awakening of religion ever afterwards influence him just as the wound i had at blenheim and of which i wear the scar hath become part of my frame and influenced my whole body nay spirit subsequently though twas got and healed forty years ago <\s>

<s> colonel macartney denied this of which the horror and indignation of the whole kingdom would nevertheless have him guilty and fled the country whither he never returned <\s>

<s> but his spirit was so high that those who wished his death knew that his courage was like his charity and never turned any man away and he died by the hands of mohun and the other two cut throats that were set on him <\s>

<s> that party to which lord mohun belonged had the benefit of his service and now were well rid of such a ruffian <\s>

<s> i say not that he was privy to duke hamilton's death i say that his party profited by it and that three desperate and bloody instruments were found to effect that murder <\s>
<s> as esmond and the dean walked away from kensington discoursing of this tragedy and how fatal it was to the cause which they both had at heart the street criers were already out with their broadsides shouting through the town the full true and horrible account of the death of lord mohun and duke hamilton in a duel <\s>

<s> no duke hamilton is dead he was murdered an hour ago by mohun and macartney they had a quarrel this morning they gave him not so much time as to write a letter <\s>

<s> but his spirit was so high that those who wished his death knew that his courage was like his charity and never turned any man away and he died by the hands of mohun and the other two cut throats that were set on him <\s>

<s> as esmond and the dean walked away from kensington discoursing of this tragedy and how fatal it was to the cause which they both had at heart the street criers were already out with their broadsides shouting through the town the full true and horrible account of the death of lord mohun and duke hamilton in a duel <\s>

<s> no duke hamilton is dead he was murdered an hour ago by mohun and macartney they had a quarrel this morning they gave him not so much time as to write a letter <\s>

<s> colonel macartney denied this of which the horror and indignation of the whole kingdom would nevertheless have him guilty and fled the country whither he never returned <\s>

<s> but his spirit was so high that those who wished his death knew that his courage was like his charity and never turned any man away and he died by the hands of mohun and the other two cut throats that were set on him <\s>

<s> no duke hamilton is dead he was murdered an hour ago by mohun and macartney they had a quarrel this morning they gave him not so much time as to write a letter <\s>

<s> colonel macartney denied this of which the horror and indignation of the whole kingdom would nevertheless have him guilty and fled the country whither he never returned <\s>

<s> but his spirit was so high that those who wished his death knew that his courage was like his charity and never turned any man away and he died by the hands of mohun and the other two cut throats that were set on him <\s>

<s> as esmond and the dean walked away from kensington discoursing of this tragedy and how fatal it was to the cause which they both had at heart the street criers were already out with their broadsides shouting through the town the full true and horrible account of the death of lord mohun and duke hamilton in a duel <\s>

<s> no duke hamilton is dead he was murdered an hour ago by mohun and macartney they had a quarrel this morning they gave him not so much time as to write a letter <\s>

<s> colonel macartney denied this of which the horror and indignation of the whole kingdom would nevertheless have him guilty and fled the country whither he never returned <\s>

<s> but his spirit was so high that those who wished his death knew that his courage was like his charity and never turned any man away and he died by the hands of mohun and the other two cut throats that were set on him <\s>

<s> that party to which lord mohun belonged had the benefit of his service and now were well rid of such a ruffian <\s>

<s> as esmond and the dean walked away from kensington discoursing of this tragedy and how fatal it was to the cause which they both had at heart the street criers were already out with their broadsides shouting through the town the full true and horrible account of the death of lord mohun and duke hamilton in a duel <\s>

<s> no duke hamilton is dead he was murdered an hour ago by mohun and macartney they had a quarrel this morning they gave him not so much time as to write a letter <\s>

<s> years after this passion hath been dead and buried along with a thousand other worldly cares and ambitions he who felt it can recall it out of its grave and admire almost as fondly as he did in his youth that lovely queenly creature <\s>

<s> colonel macartney denied this of which the horror and indignation of the whole kingdom would nevertheless have him guilty and fled the country whither he never returned <\s>
<s> what was the real cause of the duke hamilton's death a paltry quarrel that might easily have been made up and with a ruffian so low base profligate and degraded with former crimes and repeated murders that a man of such renown and princely rank as my lord duke might have disdained to sully his sword with the blood of such a villain <\s>
<s> but his spirit was so high that those who wished his death knew that his courage was like his charity and never turned any man away and he died by the hands of mohun and the other two cut throats that were set on him <\s>
<s> the queen's ambassador to paris died the loyal and devoted servant of the house of stuart and a royal prince of scotland himself and carrying the confidence the repentance of queen anne along with his own open devotion and the good will of millions in the country more to the queen's exiled brother and sovereign <\s>
<s> that party to which lord mohun belonged had the benefit of his service and now were well rid of such a ruffian <\s>
<s> he and meredith and macartney were the duke of marlborough's men and the two colonels had been broke but the year before for drinking perdition to the tories <\s>

<s> i say not that he was privy to duke hamilton's death i say that his party profited by it and that three desperate and bloody instruments were found to effect that murder <\s>
<s> as esmond and the dean walked away from kensington discoursing of this tragedy and how fatal it was to the cause which they both had at heart the street criers were already out with their broadsides shouting through the town the full true and horrible account of the death of lord mohun and duke hamilton in a duel <\s>
<s> a fellow had got to kensington and was crying it in the square there at very early morning when mr <\s>

<s> the world was going to its business again although dukes lay dead and ladies mourned for them and kings very likely lost their chances <\s>
<s> so night and day pass away and to morrow comes and our place knows us not <\s>

<s> i visit castlewood once more <\s>

<s> whatever her feelings might have been of anger or of sorrow and i fear me that the former emotion was that which most tore her heart she would take no confidant as people of softer natures would have done under such a calamity her mother and her kinsman knew that she would disdain their pity and that to offer it would be but to infuriate the cruel wound which fortune had inflicted <\s>
<s> no duke hamilton is dead he was murdered an hour ago by mohun and macartney they had a quarrel this morning they gave him not so much time as to write a letter <\s>

<s> oh beatrix beatrix thought esmond and here ends my poor girl's ambition <\s>
<s> there had been no need to urge upon esmond the necessity of a separation between him and beatrix fate had done that completely and i think from the very moment poor beatrix had accepted the duke's offer she began to assume the majestic air of a duchess nay queen elect and to carry herself as one sacred and removed from us common people <\s>
<s> her mother and kinsman both fell into her ways the latter scornfully perhaps and uttering his usual gibes at her vanity and his own <\s>
<s> there was a certain charm about this girl of which neither colonel esmond nor his fond mistress could forego the fascination in spite of her faults and her pride and wilfulness they were forced to love her and indeed might be set down as the two chief flatterers of the brilliant creature's court <\s>
<s> who in the course of his life hath not been so bewitched and worshipped some idol or another <\s>
<s> years after this passion hath been dead and buried along with a thousand other worldly cares and ambitions he who felt it can recall it out of its grave and admire almost as fondly as he did in his youth that lovely queenly creature <\s>
<s> i invoke that beautiful spirit from the shades and love her still or rather i should say such a past is always present to a man such a passion once felt forms a part of his whole being and cannot be separated from it it becomes a portion of the man of to day just as any great faith or conviction the discovery of poetry the awakening of religion ever afterwards influence him just as the wound i had at blenheim and of which i wear the scar hath become part of my frame and influenced my whole body nay spirit subsequently though twas got and healed forty years ago <\s>

<s> colonel macartney denied this of which the horror and indignation of the whole kingdom would nevertheless have him guilty and fled the country whither he never returned <\s>

<s> but his spirit was so high that those who wished his death knew that his courage was like his charity and never turned any man away and he died by the hands of mohun and the other two cut throats that were set on him <\s>

<s> as esmond and the dean walked away from kensington discoursing of this tragedy and how fatal it was to the cause which they both had at heart the street criers were already out with their broadsides shouting through the town the full true and horrible account of the death of lord mohun and duke hamilton in a duel <\s>

<s> no duke hamilton is dead he was murdered an hour ago by mohun and macartney they had a quarrel this morning they gave him not so much time as to write a letter <\s>

<s> as esmond and the dean walked away from kensington discoursing of this tragedy and how fatal it was to the cause which they both had at heart the street criers were already out with their broadsides shouting through the town the full true and horrible account of the death of lord mohun and duke hamilton in a duel <\s>

<s> no duke hamilton is dead he was murdered an hour ago by mohun and macartney they had a quarrel this morning they gave him not so much time as to write a letter <\s>

<s> colonel macartney denied this of which the horror and indignation of the whole kingdom would nevertheless have him guilty and fled the country whither he never returned <\s>
<s> what was the real cause of the duke hamilton's death a paltry quarrel that might easily have been made up and with a ruffian so low base profligate and degraded with former crimes and repeated murders that a man of such renown and princely rank as my lord duke might have disdained to sully his sword with the blood of such a villain <\s>
<s> but his spirit was so high that those who wished his death knew that his courage was like his charity and never turned any man away and he died by the hands of mohun and the other two cut throats that were set on him <\s>

<s> that party to which lord mohun belonged had the benefit of his service and now were well rid of such a ruffian <\s>

<s> i say not that he was privy to duke hamilton's death i say that his party profited by it and that three desperate and bloody instruments were found to effect that murder <\s>
<s> as esmond and the dean walked away from kensington discoursing of this tragedy and how fatal it was to the cause which they both had at heart the street criers were already out with their broadsides shouting through the town the full true and horrible account of the death of lord mohun and duke hamilton in a duel <\s>
<s> a fellow had got to kensington and was crying it in the square there at very early morning when mr <\s>

<s> whatever her feelings might have been of anger or of sorrow and i fear me that the former emotion was that which most tore her heart she would take no confidant as people of softer natures would have done under such a calamity her mother and her kinsman knew that she would disdain their pity and that to offer it would be but to infuriate the cruel wound which fortune had inflicted <\s>
<s> no duke hamilton is dead he was murdered an hour ago by mohun and macartney they had a quarrel this morning they gave him not so much time as to write a letter <\s>

<s> oh beatrix beatrix thought esmond and here ends my poor girl's ambition <\s>
<s> there had been no need to urge upon esmond the necessity of a separation between him and beatrix fate had done that completely and i think from the very moment poor beatrix had accepted the duke's offer she began to assume the majestic air of a duchess nay queen elect and to carry herself as one sacred and removed from us common people <\s>
<s> her mother and kinsman both fell into her ways the latter scornfully perhaps and uttering his usual gibes at her vanity and his own <\s>
<s> there was a certain charm about this girl of which neither colonel esmond nor his fond mistress could forego the fascination in spite of her faults and her pride and wilfulness they were forced to love her and indeed might be set down as the two chief flatterers of the brilliant creature's court <\s>

<s> years after this passion hath been dead and buried along with a thousand other worldly cares and ambitions he who felt it can recall it out of its grave and admire almost as fondly as he did in his youth that lovely queenly creature <\s>
<s> i invoke that beautiful spirit from the shades and love her still or rather i should say such a past is always present to a man such a passion once felt forms a part of his whole being and cannot be separated from it it becomes a portion of the man of to day just as any great faith or conviction the discovery of poetry the awakening of religion ever afterwards influence him just as the wound i had at blenheim and of which i wear the scar hath become part of my frame and influenced my whole body nay spirit subsequently though twas got and healed forty years ago <\s>

<s> they rushed in and closed upon each other at once without any feints or crossing of swords even and stabbed one at the other desperately each receiving many wounds and mohun having his death wound and my lord duke lying by him macartney came up and stabbed his grace as he lay on the ground and gave him the blow of which he died <\s>
<s> colonel macartney denied this of which the horror and indignation of the whole kingdom would nevertheless have him guilty and fled the country whither he never returned <\s>
<s> what was the real cause of the duke hamilton's death a paltry quarrel that might easily have been made up and with a ruffian so low base profligate and degraded with former crimes and repeated murders that a man of such renown and princely rank as my lord duke might have disdained to sully his sword with the blood of such a villain <\s>
<s> but his spirit was so high that those who wished his death knew that his courage was like his charity and never turned any man away and he died by the hands of mohun and the other two cut throats that were set on him <\s>
<s> the queen's ambassador to paris died the loyal and devoted servant of the house of stuart and a royal prince of scotland himself and carrying the confidence the repentance of queen anne along with his own open devotion and the good will of millions in the country more to the queen's exiled brother and sovereign <\s>
<s> that party to which lord mohun belonged had the benefit of his service and now were well rid of such a ruffian <\s>

<s> as esmond and the dean walked away from kensington discoursing of this tragedy and how fatal it was to the cause which they both had at heart the street criers were already out with their broadsides shouting through the town the full true and horrible account of the death of lord mohun and duke hamilton in a duel <\s>

<s> no duke hamilton is dead he was murdered an hour ago by mohun and macartney they had a quarrel this morning they gave him not so much time as to write a letter <\s>

<s> the death of mohun her husband's murderer was more awful to my mistress than even the duke's unhappy end <\s>

<s> they had met by appointment that day at the lawyer's in lincoln's inn fields had words which though they appeared very trifling to those who heard them were not so to men exasperated by long and previous enmity <\s>
<s> mohun asked my lord duke where he could see his grace's friends and within an hour had sent two of his own to arrange this deadly duel <\s>
<s> it was pursued with such fierceness and sprung from so trifling a cause that all men agreed at the time that there was a party of which these three notorious brawlers were but agents who desired to take duke hamilton's life away <\s>
<s> they fought three on a side as in that tragic meeting twelve years back which hath been recounted already and in which mohun performed his second murder <\s>
<s> they rushed in and closed upon each other at once without any feints or crossing of swords even and stabbed one at the other desperately each receiving many wounds and mohun having his death wound and my lord duke lying by him macartney came up and stabbed his grace as he lay on the ground and gave him the blow of which he died <\s>
<s> colonel macartney denied this of which the horror and indignation of the whole kingdom would nevertheless have him guilty and fled the country whither he never returned <\s>
<s> what was the real cause of the duke hamilton's death a paltry quarrel that might easily have been made up and with a ruffian so low base profligate and degraded with former crimes and repeated murders that a man of such renown and princely rank as my lord duke might have disdained to sully his sword with the blood of such a villain <\s>
<s> but his spirit was so high that those who wished his death knew that his courage was like his charity and never turned any man away and he died by the hands of mohun and the other two cut throats that were set on him <\s>
<s> the queen's ambassador to paris died the loyal and devoted servant of the house of stuart and a royal prince of scotland himself and carrying the confidence the repentance of queen anne along with his own open devotion and the good will of millions in the country more to the queen's exiled brother and sovereign <\s>
<s> that party to which lord mohun belonged had the benefit of his service and now were well rid of such a ruffian <\s>
<s> he and meredith and macartney were the duke of marlborough's men and the two colonels had been broke but the year before for drinking perdition to the tories <\s>
<s> his grace was a whig now and a hanoverian and as eager for war as prince eugene himself <\s>
<s> i say not that he was privy to duke hamilton's death i say that his party profited by it and that three desperate and bloody instruments were found to effect that murder <\s>
<s> as esmond and the dean walked away from kensington discoursing of this tragedy and how fatal it was to the cause which they both had at heart the street criers were already out with their broadsides shouting through the town the full true and horrible account of the death of lord mohun and duke hamilton in a duel <\s>
<s> a fellow had got to kensington and was crying it in the square there at very early morning when mr <\s>
<s> esmond happened to pass by <\s>
<s> he drove the man from under beatrix's very window whereof the casement had been set open <\s>
<s> the sun was shining though twas november he had seen the market carts rolling into london the guard relieved at the palace the laborers trudging to their work in the gardens between kensington and the city the wandering merchants and hawkers filling the air with their cries <\s>
<s> the world was going to its business again although dukes lay dead and ladies mourned for them and kings very likely lost their chances <\s>
<s> so night and day pass away and to morrow comes and our place knows us not <\s>
<s> esmond thought of the courier now galloping on the north road to inform him who was earl of arran yesterday that he was duke of hamilton to day and of a thousand great schemes hopes ambitions that were alive in the gallant heart beating a few hours since and now in a little dust quiescent <\s>
<s> i visit castlewood once more <\s>
<s> thus for a third time beatrix's ambitious hopes were circumvented and she might well believe that a special malignant fate watched and pursued her tearing her prize out of her hand just as she seemed to grasp it and leaving her with only rage and grief for her portion <\s>
<s> whatever her feelings might have been of anger or of sorrow and i fear me that the former emotion was that which most tore her heart she would take no confidant as people of softer natures would have done under such a calamity her mother and her kinsman knew that she would disdain their pity and that to offer it would be but to infuriate the cruel wound which fortune had inflicted <\s>
<s> no duke hamilton is dead he was murdered an hour ago by mohun and macartney they had a quarrel this morning they gave him not so much time as to write a letter <\s>
<s> he went for a couple of his friends and he is dead and mohun too the bloody villain who was set on him <\s>
<s> they fought in hyde park just before sunset the duke killed mohun and macartney came up and stabbed him and the dog is fled <\s>
<s> i have your chariot below send to every part of the country and apprehend that villain come to the duke's house and see if any life be left in him <\s>
<s> oh beatrix beatrix thought esmond and here ends my poor girl's ambition <\s>
<s> there had been no need to urge upon esmond the necessity of a separation between him and beatrix fate had done that completely and i think from the very moment poor beatrix had accepted the duke's offer she began to assume the majestic air of a duchess nay queen elect and to carry herself as one sacred and removed from us common people <\s>
<s> her mother and kinsman both fell into her ways the latter scornfully perhaps and uttering his usual gibes at her vanity and his own <\s>
<s> there was a certain charm about this girl of which neither colonel esmond nor his fond mistress could forego the fascination in spite of her faults and her pride and wilfulness they were forced to love her and indeed might be set down as the two chief flatterers of the brilliant creature's court <\s>
<s> who in the course of his life hath not been so bewitched and worshipped some idol or another <\s>
<s> years after this passion hath been dead and buried along with a thousand other worldly cares and ambitions he who felt it can recall it out of its grave and admire almost as fondly as he did in his youth that lovely queenly creature <\s>
<s> i invoke that beautiful spirit from the shades and love her still or rather i should say such a past is always present to a man such a passion once felt forms a part of his whole being and cannot be separated from it it becomes a portion of the man of to day just as any great faith or conviction the discovery of poetry the awakening of religion ever afterwards influence him just as the wound i had at blenheim and of which i wear the scar hath become part of my frame and influenced my whole body nay spirit subsequently though twas got and healed forty years ago <\s>

<s> for days before her chariot had been rolling the street from mercer to toyshop from goldsmith to laceman her taste was perfect or at least the fond bridegroom had thought so and had given her entire authority over all tradesmen and for all the plate furniture and equipages with which his grace the ambassador wished to adorn his splendid mission <\s>

<s> colonel macartney denied this of which the horror and indignation of the whole kingdom would nevertheless have him guilty and fled the country whither he never returned <\s>
<s> what was the real cause of the duke hamilton's death a paltry quarrel that might easily have been made up and with a ruffian so low base profligate and degraded with former crimes and repeated murders that a man of such renown and princely rank as my lord duke might have disdained to sully his sword with the blood of such a villain <\s>
<s> but his spirit was so high that those who wished his death knew that his courage was like his charity and never turned any man away and he died by the hands of mohun and the other two cut throats that were set on him <\s>

<s> that party to which lord mohun belonged had the benefit of his service and now were well rid of such a ruffian <\s>

<s> as esmond and the dean walked away from kensington discoursing of this tragedy and how fatal it was to the cause which they both had at heart the street criers were already out with their broadsides shouting through the town the full true and horrible account of the death of lord mohun and duke hamilton in a duel <\s>

<s> no duke hamilton is dead he was murdered an hour ago by mohun and macartney they had a quarrel this morning they gave him not so much time as to write a letter <\s>

<s> colonel macartney denied this of which the horror and indignation of the whole kingdom would nevertheless have him guilty and fled the country whither he never returned <\s>

<s> but his spirit was so high that those who wished his death knew that his courage was like his charity and never turned any man away and he died by the hands of mohun and the other two cut throats that were set on him <\s>

<s> as esmond and the dean walked away from kensington discoursing of this tragedy and how fatal it was to the cause which they both had at heart the street criers were already out with their broadsides shouting through the town the full true and horrible account of the death of lord mohun and duke hamilton in a duel <\s>
<s> a fellow had got to kensington and was crying it in the square there at very early morning when mr <\s>

<s> no duke hamilton is dead he was murdered an hour ago by mohun and macartney they had a quarrel this morning they gave him not so much time as to write a letter <\s>

<s> oh beatrix beatrix thought esmond and here ends my poor girl's ambition <\s>
<s> there had been no need to urge upon esmond the necessity of a separation between him and beatrix fate had done that completely and i think from the very moment poor beatrix had accepted the duke's offer she began to assume the majestic air of a duchess nay queen elect and to carry herself as one sacred and removed from us common people <\s>

<s> years after this passion hath been dead and buried along with a thousand other worldly cares and ambitions he who felt it can recall it out of its grave and admire almost as fondly as he did in his youth that lovely queenly creature <\s>
<s> i invoke that beautiful spirit from the shades and love her still or rather i should say such a past is always present to a man such a passion once felt forms a part of his whole being and cannot be separated from it it becomes a portion of the man of to day just as any great faith or conviction the discovery of poetry the awakening of religion ever afterwards influence him just as the wound i had at blenheim and of which i wear the scar hath become part of my frame and influenced my whole body nay spirit subsequently though twas got and healed forty years ago <\s>

<s> the death of mohun her husband's murderer was more awful to my mistress than even the duke's unhappy end <\s>

<s> it was pursued with such fierceness and sprung from so trifling a cause that all men agreed at the time that there was a party of which these three notorious brawlers were but agents who desired to take duke hamilton's life away <\s>
<s> they fought three on a side as in that tragic meeting twelve years back which hath been recounted already and in which mohun performed his second murder <\s>
<s> they rushed in and closed upon each other at once without any feints or crossing of swords even and stabbed one at the other desperately each receiving many wounds and mohun having his death wound and my lord duke lying by him macartney came up and stabbed his grace as he lay on the ground and gave him the blow of which he died <\s>
<s> colonel macartney denied this of which the horror and indignation of the whole kingdom would nevertheless have him guilty and fled the country whither he never returned <\s>
<s> what was the real cause of the duke hamilton's death a paltry quarrel that might easily have been made up and with a ruffian so low base profligate and degraded with former crimes and repeated murders that a man of such renown and princely rank as my lord duke might have disdained to sully his sword with the blood of such a villain <\s>
<s> but his spirit was so high that those who wished his death knew that his courage was like his charity and never turned any man away and he died by the hands of mohun and the other two cut throats that were set on him <\s>
<s> the queen's ambassador to paris died the loyal and devoted servant of the house of stuart and a royal prince of scotland himself and carrying the confidence the repentance of queen anne along with his own open devotion and the good will of millions in the country more to the queen's exiled brother and sovereign <\s>
<s> that party to which lord mohun belonged had the benefit of his service and now were well rid of such a ruffian <\s>
<s> he and meredith and macartney were the duke of marlborough's men and the two colonels had been broke but the year before for drinking perdition to the tories <\s>
<s> his grace was a whig now and a hanoverian and as eager for war as prince eugene himself <\s>
<s> i say not that he was privy to duke hamilton's death i say that his party profited by it and that three desperate and bloody instruments were found to effect that murder <\s>
<s> as esmond and the dean walked away from kensington discoursing of this tragedy and how fatal it was to the cause which they both had at heart the street criers were already out with their broadsides shouting through the town the full true and horrible account of the death of lord mohun and duke hamilton in a duel <\s>
<s> a fellow had got to kensington and was crying it in the square there at very early morning when mr <\s>
<s> esmond happened to pass by <\s>
<s> he drove the man from under beatrix's very window whereof the casement had been set open <\s>
<s> the sun was shining though twas november he had seen the market carts rolling into london the guard relieved at the palace the laborers trudging to their work in the gardens between kensington and the city the wandering merchants and hawkers filling the air with their cries <\s>
<s> the world was going to its business again although dukes lay dead and ladies mourned for them and kings very likely lost their chances <\s>
<s> so night and day pass away and to morrow comes and our place knows us not <\s>
<s> esmond thought of the courier now galloping on the north road to inform him who was earl of arran yesterday that he was duke of hamilton to day and of a thousand great schemes hopes ambitions that were alive in the gallant heart beating a few hours since and now in a little dust quiescent <\s>
<s> i visit castlewood once more <\s>
<s> thus for a third time beatrix's ambitious hopes were circumvented and she might well believe that a special malignant fate watched and pursued her tearing her prize out of her hand just as she seemed to grasp it and leaving her with only rage and grief for her portion <\s>
<s> whatever her feelings might have been of anger or of sorrow and i fear me that the former emotion was that which most tore her heart she would take no confidant as people of softer natures would have done under such a calamity her mother and her kinsman knew that she would disdain their pity and that to offer it would be but to infuriate the cruel wound which fortune had inflicted <\s>
<s> no duke hamilton is dead he was murdered an hour ago by mohun and macartney they had a quarrel this morning they gave him not so much time as to write a letter <\s>
<s> he went for a couple of his friends and he is dead and mohun too the bloody villain who was set on him <\s>
<s> they fought in hyde park just before sunset the duke killed mohun and macartney came up and stabbed him and the dog is fled <\s>
<s> i have your chariot below send to every part of the country and apprehend that villain come to the duke's house and see if any life be left in him <\s>
<s> oh beatrix beatrix thought esmond and here ends my poor girl's ambition <\s>
<s> there had been no need to urge upon esmond the necessity of a separation between him and beatrix fate had done that completely and i think from the very moment poor beatrix had accepted the duke's offer she began to assume the majestic air of a duchess nay queen elect and to carry herself as one sacred and removed from us common people <\s>
<s> her mother and kinsman both fell into her ways the latter scornfully perhaps and uttering his usual gibes at her vanity and his own <\s>
<s> there was a certain charm about this girl of which neither colonel esmond nor his fond mistress could forego the fascination in spite of her faults and her pride and wilfulness they were forced to love her and indeed might be set down as the two chief flatterers of the brilliant creature's court <\s>
<s> who in the course of his life hath not been so bewitched and worshipped some idol or another <\s>
<s> years after this passion hath been dead and buried along with a thousand other worldly cares and ambitions he who felt it can recall it out of its grave and admire almost as fondly as he did in his youth that lovely queenly creature <\s>
<s> i invoke that beautiful spirit from the shades and love her still or rather i should say such a past is always present to a man such a passion once felt forms a part of his whole being and cannot be separated from it it becomes a portion of the man of to day just as any great faith or conviction the discovery of poetry the awakening of religion ever afterwards influence him just as the wound i had at blenheim and of which i wear the scar hath become part of my frame and influenced my whole body nay spirit subsequently though twas got and healed forty years ago <\s>
<s> what faithful heart can do these <\s>

<s> for days before her chariot had been rolling the street from mercer to toyshop from goldsmith to laceman her taste was perfect or at least the fond bridegroom had thought so and had given her entire authority over all tradesmen and for all the plate furniture and equipages with which his grace the ambassador wished to adorn his splendid mission <\s>

<s> the death of mohun her husband's murderer was more awful to my mistress than even the duke's unhappy end <\s>
<s> esmond gave at length what particulars he knew of their quarrel and the cause of it <\s>
<s> the two noblemen had long been at war with respect to the lord gerard's property whose two daughters my lord duke and mohun had married <\s>
<s> they had met by appointment that day at the lawyer's in lincoln's inn fields had words which though they appeared very trifling to those who heard them were not so to men exasperated by long and previous enmity <\s>
<s> mohun asked my lord duke where he could see his grace's friends and within an hour had sent two of his own to arrange this deadly duel <\s>
<s> it was pursued with such fierceness and sprung from so trifling a cause that all men agreed at the time that there was a party of which these three notorious brawlers were but agents who desired to take duke hamilton's life away <\s>
<s> they fought three on a side as in that tragic meeting twelve years back which hath been recounted already and in which mohun performed his second murder <\s>
<s> they rushed in and closed upon each other at once without any feints or crossing of swords even and stabbed one at the other desperately each receiving many wounds and mohun having his death wound and my lord duke lying by him macartney came up and stabbed his grace as he lay on the ground and gave him the blow of which he died <\s>
<s> colonel macartney denied this of which the horror and indignation of the whole kingdom would nevertheless have him guilty and fled the country whither he never returned <\s>
<s> what was the real cause of the duke hamilton's death a paltry quarrel that might easily have been made up and with a ruffian so low base profligate and degraded with former crimes and repeated murders that a man of such renown and princely rank as my lord duke might have disdained to sully his sword with the blood of such a villain <\s>
<s> but his spirit was so high that those who wished his death knew that his courage was like his charity and never turned any man away and he died by the hands of mohun and the other two cut throats that were set on him <\s>
<s> the queen's ambassador to paris died the loyal and devoted servant of the house of stuart and a royal prince of scotland himself and carrying the confidence the repentance of queen anne along with his own open devotion and the good will of millions in the country more to the queen's exiled brother and sovereign <\s>
<s> that party to which lord mohun belonged had the benefit of his service and now were well rid of such a ruffian <\s>
<s> he and meredith and macartney were the duke of marlborough's men and the two colonels had been broke but the year before for drinking perdition to the tories <\s>
<s> his grace was a whig now and a hanoverian and as eager for war as prince eugene himself <\s>
<s> i say not that he was privy to duke hamilton's death i say that his party profited by it and that three desperate and bloody instruments were found to effect that murder <\s>
<s> as esmond and the dean walked away from kensington discoursing of this tragedy and how fatal it was to the cause which they both had at heart the street criers were already out with their broadsides shouting through the town the full true and horrible account of the death of lord mohun and duke hamilton in a duel <\s>
<s> a fellow had got to kensington and was crying it in the square there at very early morning when mr <\s>
<s> esmond happened to pass by <\s>
<s> he drove the man from under beatrix's very window whereof the casement had been set open <\s>
<s> the sun was shining though twas november he had seen the market carts rolling into london the guard relieved at the palace the laborers trudging to their work in the gardens between kensington and the city the wandering merchants and hawkers filling the air with their cries <\s>
<s> the world was going to its business again although dukes lay dead and ladies mourned for them and kings very likely lost their chances <\s>
<s> so night and day pass away and to morrow comes and our place knows us not <\s>
<s> esmond thought of the courier now galloping on the north road to inform him who was earl of arran yesterday that he was duke of hamilton to day and of a thousand great schemes hopes ambitions that were alive in the gallant heart beating a few hours since and now in a little dust quiescent <\s>
<s> i visit castlewood once more <\s>
<s> thus for a third time beatrix's ambitious hopes were circumvented and she might well believe that a special malignant fate watched and pursued her tearing her prize out of her hand just as she seemed to grasp it and leaving her with only rage and grief for her portion <\s>
<s> whatever her feelings might have been of anger or of sorrow and i fear me that the former emotion was that which most tore her heart she would take no confidant as people of softer natures would have done under such a calamity her mother and her kinsman knew that she would disdain their pity and that to offer it would be but to infuriate the cruel wound which fortune had inflicted <\s>

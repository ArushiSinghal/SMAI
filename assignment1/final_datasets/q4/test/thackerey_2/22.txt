<s> esmond's man honest john lockwood had served his master and the family all his life and the colonel knew that he could answer for john's fidelity as for his own <\s>
<s> john returned with the horses from rochester betimes the next morning and the colonel gave him to understand that on going to kensington where he was free of the servants hall and indeed courting miss beatrix's maid he was to ask no questions and betray no surprise but to vouch stoutly that the young gentleman he should see in a red coat there was my lord viscount castlewood and that his attendant in gray was monsieur baptiste the frenchman <\s>
<s> he was to tell his friends in the kitchen such stories as he remembered of my lord viscount's youth at castlewood what a wild boy he was how he used to drill jack and cane him before ever he was a soldier everything in fine he knew respecting my lord viscount's early days <\s>
<s> jack's ideas of painting had not been much cultivated during his residence in flanders with his master and before my young lord's return he had been easily got to believe that the picture brought over from paris and now hanging in lady castlewood's drawing room was a perfect likeness of her son the young lord <\s>
<s> and the domestics having all seen the picture many times and catching but a momentary imperfect glimpse of the two strangers on the night of their arrival never had a reason to doubt the fidelity of the portrait and next day when they saw the original of the piece habited exactly as he was represented in the painting with the same periwig ribbons and uniform of the guard quite naturally addressed the gentleman as my lord castlewood my lady viscountess's son <\s>
<s> the secretary of the night previous was now the viscount the viscount wore the secretary's gray frock and john lockwood was instructed to hint to the world below stairs that my lord being a papist and very devout in that religion his attendant might be no other than his chaplain from bruxelles hence if he took his meals in my lord's company there was little reason for surprise <\s>
<s> frank was further cautioned to speak english with a foreign accent which task he performed indifferently well and this caution was the more necessary because the prince himself scarce spoke our language like a native of the island and john lockwood laughed with the folks below stairs at the manner in which my lord after five years abroad sometimes forgot his own tongue and spoke it like a frenchman <\s>
<s> i warrant says he that with the english beef and beer his lordship will soon get back the proper use of his mouth and to do his new lordship justice he took to beer and beef very kindly <\s>
<s> the prince drank so much and was so loud and imprudent in his talk after his drink that esmond often trembled for him <\s>

<s> i fear that colonel esmond's mind was rather relieved than otherwise when he found that the ancillary beauty was the one whom the prince had selected <\s>
<s> his royal tastes were known to lie that way and continued so in after life <\s>
<s> the heir of one of the greatest names of the greatest kingdoms and of the greatest misfortunes in europe was often content to lay the dignity of his birth and grief at the wooden shoes of a french chambermaid and to repent afterwards for he was very devout in ashes taken from the dust pan <\s>

<s> a year afterwards gallant heads were falling and nithsdale in escape and derwentwater on the scaffold whilst the heedless ingrate for whom they risked and lost all was tippling with his seraglio of mistresses in his petite maison of chaillot <\s>
<s> blushing to be forced to bear such an errand esmond had to go to the prince and warn him that the girl whom his highness was bribing was john lockwood's sweetheart an honest resolute man who had served in six campaigns and feared nothing and who knew that the person calling himself lord castlewood was not his young master and the colonel besought the prince to consider what the effect of a single man's jealousy might be and to think of other designs he had in hand more important than the seduction of a waiting maid and the humiliation of a brave man <\s>
<s> ten times perhaps in the course of as many days mr <\s>
<s> esmond had to warn the royal young adventurer of some imprudence or some freedom <\s>

<s> the ladies entertained him at cards over which amusement he spent many hours in each day and night <\s>
<s> he passed many hours more in drinking during which time he would rattle and talk very agreeably and especially if the colonel was absent whose presence always seemed to frighten him and the poor colonel noir took that hint as a command accordingly and seldom intruded his black face upon the convivial hours of this august young prisoner <\s>

<s> as for lady castlewood although she scarce spoke a word twas easy to gather from her demeanor and one or two hints she dropped how deep her mortification was at finding the hero whom she had chosen to worship all her life and whose restoration had formed almost the most sacred part of her prayers no more than a man and not a good one <\s>
<s> she thought misfortune might have chastened him but that instructress had rather rendered him callous than humble <\s>
<s> his devotion which was quite real kept him from no sin he had a mind to <\s>
<s> his talk showed good humor gayety even wit enough but there was a levity in his acts and words that he had brought from among those libertine devotees with whom he had been bred and that shocked the simplicity and purity of the english lady whose guest he was <\s>
<s> esmond spoke his mind to beatrix pretty freely about the prince getting her brother to put in a word of warning <\s>
<s> beatrix was entirely of their opinion she thought he was very light very light and reckless she could not even see the good looks colonel esmond had spoken of <\s>
<s> the prince had bad teeth and a decided squint <\s>
<s> how could we say he did not squint <\s>
<s> his eyes were fine but there was certainly a cast in them <\s>
<s> she rallied him at table with wonderful wit she spoke of him invariably as of a mere boy she was more fond of esmond than ever praised him to her brother praised him to the prince when his royal highness was pleased to sneer at the colonel and warmly espoused his cause and if your majesty does not give him the garter his father had when the marquis of esmond comes to your majesty's court i will hang myself in my own garters or will cry my eyes out <\s>
<s> rather than lose those says the prince he shall be made archbishop and colonel of the guard it was frank castlewood who told me of this conversation over their supper <\s>

<s> and she made him a great curtsy and drank a part of a glass of wine in his honor <\s>
<s> the prince seized hold of the glass and drank the last drop of it castlewood said and my mother looking very anxious rose up and asked leave to retire <\s>

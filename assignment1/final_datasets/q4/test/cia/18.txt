<s> its golden age occurred in the 16th century <\s>
<s> during the following century the strengthening of the gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation <\s>
<s> in a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795 russia prussia and austria partitioned poland amongst themselves <\s>
<s> poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by germany and the soviet union in world war ii <\s>
<s> it became a soviet satellite state following the war but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive <\s>
<s> labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union solidarity that over time became a political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and the presidency <\s>
<s> a shock therapy program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in central europe but poland still faces the lingering challenges of high unemployment underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure and a poor rural underclass <\s>
<s> solidarity suffered a major defeat in the 2001 parliamentary elections when it failed to elect a single deputy to the lower house of parliament and the new leaders of the solidarity trade union subsequently pledged to reduce the trade union's political role <\s>
<s> poland joined nato in 1999 and the european union in 2004 <\s>

<s> its golden age occurred in the 16th century <\s>
<s> during the following century the strengthening of the gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation <\s>
<s> in a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795 russia prussia and austria partitioned poland amongst themselves <\s>
<s> poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by germany and the soviet union in world war ii <\s>
<s> it became a soviet satellite state following the war but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive <\s>
<s> labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union solidarity that over time became a political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and the presidency <\s>
<s> a shock therapy program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in central europe but poland still faces the lingering challenges of high unemployment underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure and a poor rural underclass <\s>
<s> solidarity suffered a major defeat in the 2001 parliamentary elections when it failed to elect a single deputy to the lower house of parliament and the new leaders of the solidarity trade union subsequently pledged to reduce the trade union's political role <\s>
<s> poland joined nato in 1999 and the european union in 2004 <\s>

<s> its golden age occurred in the 16th century <\s>
<s> during the following century the strengthening of the gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation <\s>
<s> in a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795 russia prussia and austria partitioned poland amongst themselves <\s>
<s> poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by germany and the soviet union in world war ii <\s>
<s> it became a soviet satellite state following the war but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive <\s>
<s> labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union solidarity that over time became a political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and the presidency <\s>
<s> a shock therapy program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in central europe but poland still faces the lingering challenges of high unemployment underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure and a poor rural underclass <\s>
<s> solidarity suffered a major defeat in the 2001 parliamentary elections when it failed to elect a single deputy to the lower house of parliament and the new leaders of the solidarity trade union subsequently pledged to reduce the trade union's political role <\s>
<s> poland joined nato in 1999 and the european union in 2004 <\s>

<s> its golden age occurred in the 16th century <\s>
<s> during the following century the strengthening of the gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation <\s>
<s> in a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795 russia prussia and austria partitioned poland amongst themselves <\s>
<s> poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by germany and the soviet union in world war ii <\s>
<s> it became a soviet satellite state following the war but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive <\s>
<s> labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union solidarity that over time became a political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and the presidency <\s>
<s> a shock therapy program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in central europe but poland still faces the lingering challenges of high unemployment underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure and a poor rural underclass <\s>
<s> solidarity suffered a major defeat in the 2001 parliamentary elections when it failed to elect a single deputy to the lower house of parliament and the new leaders of the solidarity trade union subsequently pledged to reduce the trade union's political role <\s>
<s> poland joined nato in 1999 and the european union in 2004 <\s>

<s> its golden age occurred in the 16th century <\s>
<s> during the following century the strengthening of the gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation <\s>
<s> in a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795 russia prussia and austria partitioned poland amongst themselves <\s>
<s> poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by germany and the soviet union in world war ii <\s>
<s> it became a soviet satellite state following the war but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive <\s>
<s> labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union solidarity that over time became a political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and the presidency <\s>
<s> a shock therapy program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in central europe but poland still faces the lingering challenges of high unemployment underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure and a poor rural underclass <\s>
<s> solidarity suffered a major defeat in the 2001 parliamentary elections when it failed to elect a single deputy to the lower house of parliament and the new leaders of the solidarity trade union subsequently pledged to reduce the trade union's political role <\s>
<s> poland joined nato in 1999 and the european union in 2004 <\s>

<s> its golden age occurred in the 16th century <\s>
<s> during the following century the strengthening of the gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation <\s>
<s> in a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795 russia prussia and austria partitioned poland amongst themselves <\s>
<s> poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by germany and the soviet union in world war ii <\s>
<s> it became a soviet satellite state following the war but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive <\s>
<s> labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union solidarity that over time became a political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and the presidency <\s>
<s> a shock therapy program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in central europe but poland still faces the lingering challenges of high unemployment underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure and a poor rural underclass <\s>
<s> solidarity suffered a major defeat in the 2001 parliamentary elections when it failed to elect a single deputy to the lower house of parliament and the new leaders of the solidarity trade union subsequently pledged to reduce the trade union's political role <\s>
<s> poland joined nato in 1999 and the european union in 2004 <\s>

<s> its golden age occurred in the 16th century <\s>
<s> during the following century the strengthening of the gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation <\s>
<s> in a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795 russia prussia and austria partitioned poland amongst themselves <\s>
<s> poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by germany and the soviet union in world war ii <\s>
<s> it became a soviet satellite state following the war but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive <\s>
<s> labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union solidarity that over time became a political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and the presidency <\s>
<s> a shock therapy program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in central europe but poland still faces the lingering challenges of high unemployment underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure and a poor rural underclass <\s>
<s> solidarity suffered a major defeat in the 2001 parliamentary elections when it failed to elect a single deputy to the lower house of parliament and the new leaders of the solidarity trade union subsequently pledged to reduce the trade union's political role <\s>
<s> poland joined nato in 1999 and the european union in 2004 <\s>

<s> its golden age occurred in the 16th century <\s>
<s> during the following century the strengthening of the gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation <\s>
<s> in a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795 russia prussia and austria partitioned poland amongst themselves <\s>
<s> poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by germany and the soviet union in world war ii <\s>
<s> it became a soviet satellite state following the war but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive <\s>
<s> labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union solidarity that over time became a political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and the presidency <\s>
<s> a shock therapy program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in central europe but poland still faces the lingering challenges of high unemployment underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure and a poor rural underclass <\s>
<s> solidarity suffered a major defeat in the 2001 parliamentary elections when it failed to elect a single deputy to the lower house of parliament and the new leaders of the solidarity trade union subsequently pledged to reduce the trade union's political role <\s>
<s> poland joined nato in 1999 and the european union in 2004 <\s>

<s> its golden age occurred in the 16th century <\s>
<s> during the following century the strengthening of the gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation <\s>
<s> in a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795 russia prussia and austria partitioned poland amongst themselves <\s>
<s> poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by germany and the soviet union in world war ii <\s>
<s> it became a soviet satellite state following the war but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive <\s>
<s> labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union solidarity that over time became a political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and the presidency <\s>
<s> a shock therapy program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in central europe but poland still faces the lingering challenges of high unemployment underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure and a poor rural underclass <\s>
<s> solidarity suffered a major defeat in the 2001 parliamentary elections when it failed to elect a single deputy to the lower house of parliament and the new leaders of the solidarity trade union subsequently pledged to reduce the trade union's political role <\s>
<s> poland joined nato in 1999 and the european union in 2004 <\s>

<s> its golden age occurred in the 16th century <\s>
<s> during the following century the strengthening of the gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation <\s>
<s> in a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795 russia prussia and austria partitioned poland amongst themselves <\s>
<s> poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by germany and the soviet union in world war ii <\s>
<s> it became a soviet satellite state following the war but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive <\s>
<s> labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union solidarity that over time became a political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and the presidency <\s>
<s> a shock therapy program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in central europe but poland still faces the lingering challenges of high unemployment underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure and a poor rural underclass <\s>
<s> solidarity suffered a major defeat in the 2001 parliamentary elections when it failed to elect a single deputy to the lower house of parliament and the new leaders of the solidarity trade union subsequently pledged to reduce the trade union's political role <\s>
<s> poland joined nato in 1999 and the european union in 2004 <\s>

<s> its golden age occurred in the 16th century <\s>
<s> during the following century the strengthening of the gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation <\s>
<s> in a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795 russia prussia and austria partitioned poland amongst themselves <\s>
<s> poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by germany and the soviet union in world war ii <\s>
<s> it became a soviet satellite state following the war but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive <\s>
<s> labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union solidarity that over time became a political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and the presidency <\s>
<s> a shock therapy program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in central europe but poland still faces the lingering challenges of high unemployment underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure and a poor rural underclass <\s>
<s> solidarity suffered a major defeat in the 2001 parliamentary elections when it failed to elect a single deputy to the lower house of parliament and the new leaders of the solidarity trade union subsequently pledged to reduce the trade union's political role <\s>
<s> poland joined nato in 1999 and the european union in 2004 <\s>

<s> its golden age occurred in the 16th century <\s>
<s> during the following century the strengthening of the gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation <\s>
<s> in a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795 russia prussia and austria partitioned poland amongst themselves <\s>
<s> poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by germany and the soviet union in world war ii <\s>
<s> it became a soviet satellite state following the war but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive <\s>
<s> labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union solidarity that over time became a political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and the presidency <\s>
<s> a shock therapy program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in central europe but poland still faces the lingering challenges of high unemployment underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure and a poor rural underclass <\s>
<s> solidarity suffered a major defeat in the 2001 parliamentary elections when it failed to elect a single deputy to the lower house of parliament and the new leaders of the solidarity trade union subsequently pledged to reduce the trade union's political role <\s>
<s> poland joined nato in 1999 and the european union in 2004 <\s>

<s> its golden age occurred in the 16th century <\s>
<s> during the following century the strengthening of the gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation <\s>
<s> in a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795 russia prussia and austria partitioned poland amongst themselves <\s>
<s> poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by germany and the soviet union in world war ii <\s>
<s> it became a soviet satellite state following the war but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive <\s>
<s> labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union solidarity that over time became a political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and the presidency <\s>
<s> a shock therapy program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in central europe but poland still faces the lingering challenges of high unemployment underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure and a poor rural underclass <\s>
<s> solidarity suffered a major defeat in the 2001 parliamentary elections when it failed to elect a single deputy to the lower house of parliament and the new leaders of the solidarity trade union subsequently pledged to reduce the trade union's political role <\s>
<s> poland joined nato in 1999 and the european union in 2004 <\s>

<s> its golden age occurred in the 16th century <\s>
<s> during the following century the strengthening of the gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation <\s>
<s> in a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795 russia prussia and austria partitioned poland amongst themselves <\s>
<s> poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by germany and the soviet union in world war ii <\s>
<s> it became a soviet satellite state following the war but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive <\s>
<s> labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union solidarity that over time became a political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and the presidency <\s>
<s> a shock therapy program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in central europe but poland still faces the lingering challenges of high unemployment underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure and a poor rural underclass <\s>
<s> solidarity suffered a major defeat in the 2001 parliamentary elections when it failed to elect a single deputy to the lower house of parliament and the new leaders of the solidarity trade union subsequently pledged to reduce the trade union's political role <\s>
<s> poland joined nato in 1999 and the european union in 2004 <\s>

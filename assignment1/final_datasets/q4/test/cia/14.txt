<s> during the medieval period kosovo became the center of a serbian empire and saw the construction of many important serb religious sites including many architecturally significant serbian orthodox monasteries <\s>
<s> the defeat of serbian forces at the battle of kosovo in 1389 led to five centuries of ottoman rule during which large numbers of turks and albanians moved to kosovo <\s>

<s> serbia reacquired control over kosovo from the ottoman empire during the first balkan war of 1912 <\s>

<s> during the medieval period kosovo became the center of a serbian empire and saw the construction of many important serb religious sites including many architecturally significant serbian orthodox monasteries <\s>

<s> serbia reacquired control over kosovo from the ottoman empire during the first balkan war of 1912 <\s>

<s> albanians dissatisfied with rugova's passive strategy in the 1990s created the kosovo liberation army and launched an insurgency <\s>
<s> starting in 1998 serbian military police and paramilitary forces conducted a counterinsurgency campaign that resulted in massacres and massive expulsions of ethnic albanians <\s>
<s> approximately 800,000 albanians were forced from their homes in kosovo during this time <\s>
<s> international attempts to mediate the conflict failed and milosevic's rejection of a proposed settlement led to a three-month nato military campaign against serbia beginning in march 1999 that forced serbia to agree to withdraw its military and police forces from kosovo <\s>

<s> during the medieval period kosovo became the center of a serbian empire and saw the construction of many important serb religious sites including many architecturally significant serbian orthodox monasteries <\s>
<s> the defeat of serbian forces at the battle of kosovo in 1389 led to five centuries of ottoman rule during which large numbers of turks and albanians moved to kosovo <\s>
<s> by the end of the 19th century albanians replaced the serbs as the dominant ethnic group in kosovo <\s>
<s> serbia reacquired control over kosovo from the ottoman empire during the first balkan war of 1912 <\s>
<s> kosovo became an autonomous province of serbia with status almost equivalent to that of a republic under the 1974 constitution of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia <\s>
<s> despite legislative concessions albanian nationalism increased in the 1980s which led to riots and calls for kosovo's independence <\s>

<s> kosovo albanian leaders responded in 1991 by organizing a referendum that declared kosovo independent <\s>

<s> albanians dissatisfied with rugova's passive strategy in the 1990s created the kosovo liberation army and launched an insurgency <\s>
<s> starting in 1998 serbian military police and paramilitary forces conducted a counterinsurgency campaign that resulted in massacres and massive expulsions of ethnic albanians <\s>
<s> approximately 800,000 albanians were forced from their homes in kosovo during this time <\s>
<s> international attempts to mediate the conflict failed and milosevic's rejection of a proposed settlement led to a three-month nato military campaign against serbia beginning in march 1999 that forced serbia to agree to withdraw its military and police forces from kosovo <\s>

<s> during the medieval period kosovo became the center of a serbian empire and saw the construction of many important serb religious sites including many architecturally significant serbian orthodox monasteries <\s>

<s> serbia reacquired control over kosovo from the ottoman empire during the first balkan war of 1912 <\s>

<s> albanians dissatisfied with rugova's passive strategy in the 1990s created the kosovo liberation army and launched an insurgency <\s>
<s> starting in 1998 serbian military police and paramilitary forces conducted a counterinsurgency campaign that resulted in massacres and massive expulsions of ethnic albanians <\s>
<s> approximately 800,000 albanians were forced from their homes in kosovo during this time <\s>
<s> international attempts to mediate the conflict failed and milosevic's rejection of a proposed settlement led to a three-month nato military campaign against serbia beginning in march 1999 that forced serbia to agree to withdraw its military and police forces from kosovo <\s>

<s> during the medieval period kosovo became the center of a serbian empire and saw the construction of many important serb religious sites including many architecturally significant serbian orthodox monasteries <\s>
<s> the defeat of serbian forces at the battle of kosovo in 1389 led to five centuries of ottoman rule during which large numbers of turks and albanians moved to kosovo <\s>
<s> by the end of the 19th century albanians replaced the serbs as the dominant ethnic group in kosovo <\s>
<s> serbia reacquired control over kosovo from the ottoman empire during the first balkan war of 1912 <\s>
<s> kosovo became an autonomous province of serbia with status almost equivalent to that of a republic under the 1974 constitution of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia <\s>
<s> despite legislative concessions albanian nationalism increased in the 1980s which led to riots and calls for kosovo's independence <\s>

<s> kosovo albanian leaders responded in 1991 by organizing a referendum that declared kosovo independent <\s>

<s> albanians dissatisfied with rugova's passive strategy in the 1990s created the kosovo liberation army and launched an insurgency <\s>
<s> starting in 1998 serbian military police and paramilitary forces conducted a counterinsurgency campaign that resulted in massacres and massive expulsions of ethnic albanians <\s>
<s> approximately 800,000 albanians were forced from their homes in kosovo during this time <\s>
<s> international attempts to mediate the conflict failed and milosevic's rejection of a proposed settlement led to a three-month nato military campaign against serbia beginning in march 1999 that forced serbia to agree to withdraw its military and police forces from kosovo <\s>

<s> during the medieval period kosovo became the center of a serbian empire and saw the construction of many important serb religious sites including many architecturally significant serbian orthodox monasteries <\s>

<s> serbia reacquired control over kosovo from the ottoman empire during the first balkan war of 1912 <\s>

<s> albanians dissatisfied with rugova's passive strategy in the 1990s created the kosovo liberation army and launched an insurgency <\s>
<s> starting in 1998 serbian military police and paramilitary forces conducted a counterinsurgency campaign that resulted in massacres and massive expulsions of ethnic albanians <\s>
<s> approximately 800,000 albanians were forced from their homes in kosovo during this time <\s>
<s> international attempts to mediate the conflict failed and milosevic's rejection of a proposed settlement led to a three-month nato military campaign against serbia beginning in march 1999 that forced serbia to agree to withdraw its military and police forces from kosovo <\s>

<s> during the medieval period kosovo became the center of a serbian empire and saw the construction of many important serb religious sites including many architecturally significant serbian orthodox monasteries <\s>
<s> the defeat of serbian forces at the battle of kosovo in 1389 led to five centuries of ottoman rule during which large numbers of turks and albanians moved to kosovo <\s>
<s> by the end of the 19th century albanians replaced the serbs as the dominant ethnic group in kosovo <\s>
<s> serbia reacquired control over kosovo from the ottoman empire during the first balkan war of 1912 <\s>
<s> kosovo became an autonomous province of serbia with status almost equivalent to that of a republic under the 1974 constitution of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia <\s>
<s> despite legislative concessions albanian nationalism increased in the 1980s which led to riots and calls for kosovo's independence <\s>

<s> kosovo albanian leaders responded in 1991 by organizing a referendum that declared kosovo independent <\s>

<s> albanians dissatisfied with rugova's passive strategy in the 1990s created the kosovo liberation army and launched an insurgency <\s>
<s> starting in 1998 serbian military police and paramilitary forces conducted a counterinsurgency campaign that resulted in massacres and massive expulsions of ethnic albanians <\s>
<s> approximately 800,000 albanians were forced from their homes in kosovo during this time <\s>
<s> international attempts to mediate the conflict failed and milosevic's rejection of a proposed settlement led to a three-month nato military campaign against serbia beginning in march 1999 that forced serbia to agree to withdraw its military and police forces from kosovo <\s>

<s> during the medieval period kosovo became the center of a serbian empire and saw the construction of many important serb religious sites including many architecturally significant serbian orthodox monasteries <\s>

<s> serbia reacquired control over kosovo from the ottoman empire during the first balkan war of 1912 <\s>

<s> albanians dissatisfied with rugova's passive strategy in the 1990s created the kosovo liberation army and launched an insurgency <\s>
<s> starting in 1998 serbian military police and paramilitary forces conducted a counterinsurgency campaign that resulted in massacres and massive expulsions of ethnic albanians <\s>
<s> approximately 800,000 albanians were forced from their homes in kosovo during this time <\s>
<s> international attempts to mediate the conflict failed and milosevic's rejection of a proposed settlement led to a three-month nato military campaign against serbia beginning in march 1999 that forced serbia to agree to withdraw its military and police forces from kosovo <\s>

<s> during the medieval period kosovo became the center of a serbian empire and saw the construction of many important serb religious sites including many architecturally significant serbian orthodox monasteries <\s>
<s> the defeat of serbian forces at the battle of kosovo in 1389 led to five centuries of ottoman rule during which large numbers of turks and albanians moved to kosovo <\s>
<s> by the end of the 19th century albanians replaced the serbs as the dominant ethnic group in kosovo <\s>
<s> serbia reacquired control over kosovo from the ottoman empire during the first balkan war of 1912 <\s>
<s> kosovo became an autonomous province of serbia with status almost equivalent to that of a republic under the 1974 constitution of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia <\s>
<s> despite legislative concessions albanian nationalism increased in the 1980s which led to riots and calls for kosovo's independence <\s>

<s> kosovo albanian leaders responded in 1991 by organizing a referendum that declared kosovo independent <\s>

<s> albanians dissatisfied with rugova's passive strategy in the 1990s created the kosovo liberation army and launched an insurgency <\s>
<s> starting in 1998 serbian military police and paramilitary forces conducted a counterinsurgency campaign that resulted in massacres and massive expulsions of ethnic albanians <\s>
<s> approximately 800,000 albanians were forced from their homes in kosovo during this time <\s>
<s> international attempts to mediate the conflict failed and milosevic's rejection of a proposed settlement led to a three-month nato military campaign against serbia beginning in march 1999 that forced serbia to agree to withdraw its military and police forces from kosovo <\s>

<s> during the medieval period kosovo became the center of a serbian empire and saw the construction of many important serb religious sites including many architecturally significant serbian orthodox monasteries <\s>

<s> serbia reacquired control over kosovo from the ottoman empire during the first balkan war of 1912 <\s>

<s> albanians dissatisfied with rugova's passive strategy in the 1990s created the kosovo liberation army and launched an insurgency <\s>
<s> starting in 1998 serbian military police and paramilitary forces conducted a counterinsurgency campaign that resulted in massacres and massive expulsions of ethnic albanians <\s>
<s> approximately 800,000 albanians were forced from their homes in kosovo during this time <\s>
<s> international attempts to mediate the conflict failed and milosevic's rejection of a proposed settlement led to a three-month nato military campaign against serbia beginning in march 1999 that forced serbia to agree to withdraw its military and police forces from kosovo <\s>

<s> during the medieval period kosovo became the center of a serbian empire and saw the construction of many important serb religious sites including many architecturally significant serbian orthodox monasteries <\s>
<s> the defeat of serbian forces at the battle of kosovo in 1389 led to five centuries of ottoman rule during which large numbers of turks and albanians moved to kosovo <\s>
<s> by the end of the 19th century albanians replaced the serbs as the dominant ethnic group in kosovo <\s>
<s> serbia reacquired control over kosovo from the ottoman empire during the first balkan war of 1912 <\s>
<s> kosovo became an autonomous province of serbia with status almost equivalent to that of a republic under the 1974 constitution of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia <\s>
<s> despite legislative concessions albanian nationalism increased in the 1980s which led to riots and calls for kosovo's independence <\s>

<s> kosovo albanian leaders responded in 1991 by organizing a referendum that declared kosovo independent <\s>

<s> albanians dissatisfied with rugova's passive strategy in the 1990s created the kosovo liberation army and launched an insurgency <\s>
<s> starting in 1998 serbian military police and paramilitary forces conducted a counterinsurgency campaign that resulted in massacres and massive expulsions of ethnic albanians <\s>
<s> approximately 800,000 albanians were forced from their homes in kosovo during this time <\s>
<s> international attempts to mediate the conflict failed and milosevic's rejection of a proposed settlement led to a three-month nato military campaign against serbia beginning in march 1999 that forced serbia to agree to withdraw its military and police forces from kosovo <\s>

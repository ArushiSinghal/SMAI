<s> the region where the cold waters of the acc meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border the antarctic convergence which fluctuates with the seasons but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region <\s>
<s> the convergence concentrates nutrients which promotes marine plant life and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life <\s>
<s> in the spring of 2000 the international hydrographic organization decided to delimit the waters within the convergence as a fifth world ocean the southern ocean by combining the southern portions of the atlantic ocean indian ocean and pacific ocean <\s>

<s> as such the southern ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans after the pacific ocean atlantic ocean and indian ocean but larger than the arctic ocean <\s>

has shown that the antarctic circumpolar current acc an ocean current that flows from west to east around antarctica plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation <\s>
<s> the region where the cold waters of the acc meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border the antarctic convergence which fluctuates with the seasons but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region <\s>
<s> the convergence concentrates nutrients which promotes marine plant life and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life <\s>
<s> in the spring of 2000 the international hydrographic organization decided to delimit the waters within the convergence as a fifth world ocean the southern ocean by combining the southern portions of the atlantic ocean indian ocean and pacific ocean <\s>
<s> the southern ocean extends from the coast of antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude which coincides with the antarctic treaty limit and which approximates the extent of the antarctic convergence <\s>
<s> as such the southern ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans after the pacific ocean atlantic ocean and indian ocean but larger than the arctic ocean <\s>

has shown that the antarctic circumpolar current acc an ocean current that flows from west to east around antarctica plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation <\s>
<s> the region where the cold waters of the acc meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border the antarctic convergence which fluctuates with the seasons but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region <\s>
<s> the convergence concentrates nutrients which promotes marine plant life and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life <\s>
<s> in the spring of 2000 the international hydrographic organization decided to delimit the waters within the convergence as a fifth world ocean the southern ocean by combining the southern portions of the atlantic ocean indian ocean and pacific ocean <\s>
<s> the southern ocean extends from the coast of antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude which coincides with the antarctic treaty limit and which approximates the extent of the antarctic convergence <\s>
<s> as such the southern ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans after the pacific ocean atlantic ocean and indian ocean but larger than the arctic ocean <\s>

has shown that the antarctic circumpolar current acc an ocean current that flows from west to east around antarctica plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation <\s>
<s> the region where the cold waters of the acc meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border the antarctic convergence which fluctuates with the seasons but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region <\s>
<s> the convergence concentrates nutrients which promotes marine plant life and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life <\s>
<s> in the spring of 2000 the international hydrographic organization decided to delimit the waters within the convergence as a fifth world ocean the southern ocean by combining the southern portions of the atlantic ocean indian ocean and pacific ocean <\s>
<s> the southern ocean extends from the coast of antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude which coincides with the antarctic treaty limit and which approximates the extent of the antarctic convergence <\s>
<s> as such the southern ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans after the pacific ocean atlantic ocean and indian ocean but larger than the arctic ocean <\s>

has shown that the antarctic circumpolar current acc an ocean current that flows from west to east around antarctica plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation <\s>
<s> the region where the cold waters of the acc meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border the antarctic convergence which fluctuates with the seasons but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region <\s>
<s> the convergence concentrates nutrients which promotes marine plant life and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life <\s>
<s> in the spring of 2000 the international hydrographic organization decided to delimit the waters within the convergence as a fifth world ocean the southern ocean by combining the southern portions of the atlantic ocean indian ocean and pacific ocean <\s>
<s> the southern ocean extends from the coast of antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude which coincides with the antarctic treaty limit and which approximates the extent of the antarctic convergence <\s>
<s> as such the southern ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans after the pacific ocean atlantic ocean and indian ocean but larger than the arctic ocean <\s>

has shown that the antarctic circumpolar current acc an ocean current that flows from west to east around antarctica plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation <\s>
<s> the region where the cold waters of the acc meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border the antarctic convergence which fluctuates with the seasons but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region <\s>
<s> the convergence concentrates nutrients which promotes marine plant life and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life <\s>
<s> in the spring of 2000 the international hydrographic organization decided to delimit the waters within the convergence as a fifth world ocean the southern ocean by combining the southern portions of the atlantic ocean indian ocean and pacific ocean <\s>
<s> the southern ocean extends from the coast of antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude which coincides with the antarctic treaty limit and which approximates the extent of the antarctic convergence <\s>
<s> as such the southern ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans after the pacific ocean atlantic ocean and indian ocean but larger than the arctic ocean <\s>

has shown that the antarctic circumpolar current acc an ocean current that flows from west to east around antarctica plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation <\s>
<s> the region where the cold waters of the acc meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border the antarctic convergence which fluctuates with the seasons but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region <\s>
<s> the convergence concentrates nutrients which promotes marine plant life and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life <\s>
<s> in the spring of 2000 the international hydrographic organization decided to delimit the waters within the convergence as a fifth world ocean the southern ocean by combining the southern portions of the atlantic ocean indian ocean and pacific ocean <\s>
<s> the southern ocean extends from the coast of antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude which coincides with the antarctic treaty limit and which approximates the extent of the antarctic convergence <\s>
<s> as such the southern ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans after the pacific ocean atlantic ocean and indian ocean but larger than the arctic ocean <\s>

has shown that the antarctic circumpolar current acc an ocean current that flows from west to east around antarctica plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation <\s>
<s> the region where the cold waters of the acc meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border the antarctic convergence which fluctuates with the seasons but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region <\s>
<s> the convergence concentrates nutrients which promotes marine plant life and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life <\s>
<s> in the spring of 2000 the international hydrographic organization decided to delimit the waters within the convergence as a fifth world ocean the southern ocean by combining the southern portions of the atlantic ocean indian ocean and pacific ocean <\s>
<s> the southern ocean extends from the coast of antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude which coincides with the antarctic treaty limit and which approximates the extent of the antarctic convergence <\s>
<s> as such the southern ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans after the pacific ocean atlantic ocean and indian ocean but larger than the arctic ocean <\s>

has shown that the antarctic circumpolar current acc an ocean current that flows from west to east around antarctica plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation <\s>
<s> the region where the cold waters of the acc meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border the antarctic convergence which fluctuates with the seasons but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region <\s>
<s> the convergence concentrates nutrients which promotes marine plant life and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life <\s>
<s> in the spring of 2000 the international hydrographic organization decided to delimit the waters within the convergence as a fifth world ocean the southern ocean by combining the southern portions of the atlantic ocean indian ocean and pacific ocean <\s>
<s> the southern ocean extends from the coast of antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude which coincides with the antarctic treaty limit and which approximates the extent of the antarctic convergence <\s>
<s> as such the southern ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans after the pacific ocean atlantic ocean and indian ocean but larger than the arctic ocean <\s>

has shown that the antarctic circumpolar current acc an ocean current that flows from west to east around antarctica plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation <\s>
<s> the region where the cold waters of the acc meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border the antarctic convergence which fluctuates with the seasons but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region <\s>
<s> the convergence concentrates nutrients which promotes marine plant life and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life <\s>
<s> in the spring of 2000 the international hydrographic organization decided to delimit the waters within the convergence as a fifth world ocean the southern ocean by combining the southern portions of the atlantic ocean indian ocean and pacific ocean <\s>
<s> the southern ocean extends from the coast of antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude which coincides with the antarctic treaty limit and which approximates the extent of the antarctic convergence <\s>
<s> as such the southern ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans after the pacific ocean atlantic ocean and indian ocean but larger than the arctic ocean <\s>

has shown that the antarctic circumpolar current acc an ocean current that flows from west to east around antarctica plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation <\s>
<s> the region where the cold waters of the acc meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border the antarctic convergence which fluctuates with the seasons but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region <\s>
<s> the convergence concentrates nutrients which promotes marine plant life and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life <\s>
<s> in the spring of 2000 the international hydrographic organization decided to delimit the waters within the convergence as a fifth world ocean the southern ocean by combining the southern portions of the atlantic ocean indian ocean and pacific ocean <\s>
<s> the southern ocean extends from the coast of antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude which coincides with the antarctic treaty limit and which approximates the extent of the antarctic convergence <\s>
<s> as such the southern ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans after the pacific ocean atlantic ocean and indian ocean but larger than the arctic ocean <\s>

has shown that the antarctic circumpolar current acc an ocean current that flows from west to east around antarctica plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation <\s>
<s> the region where the cold waters of the acc meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border the antarctic convergence which fluctuates with the seasons but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region <\s>
<s> the convergence concentrates nutrients which promotes marine plant life and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life <\s>
<s> in the spring of 2000 the international hydrographic organization decided to delimit the waters within the convergence as a fifth world ocean the southern ocean by combining the southern portions of the atlantic ocean indian ocean and pacific ocean <\s>
<s> the southern ocean extends from the coast of antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude which coincides with the antarctic treaty limit and which approximates the extent of the antarctic convergence <\s>
<s> as such the southern ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans after the pacific ocean atlantic ocean and indian ocean but larger than the arctic ocean <\s>

has shown that the antarctic circumpolar current acc an ocean current that flows from west to east around antarctica plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation <\s>
<s> the region where the cold waters of the acc meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border the antarctic convergence which fluctuates with the seasons but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region <\s>
<s> the convergence concentrates nutrients which promotes marine plant life and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life <\s>
<s> in the spring of 2000 the international hydrographic organization decided to delimit the waters within the convergence as a fifth world ocean the southern ocean by combining the southern portions of the atlantic ocean indian ocean and pacific ocean <\s>
<s> the southern ocean extends from the coast of antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude which coincides with the antarctic treaty limit and which approximates the extent of the antarctic convergence <\s>
<s> as such the southern ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans after the pacific ocean atlantic ocean and indian ocean but larger than the arctic ocean <\s>

has shown that the antarctic circumpolar current acc an ocean current that flows from west to east around antarctica plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation <\s>
<s> the region where the cold waters of the acc meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border the antarctic convergence which fluctuates with the seasons but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region <\s>
<s> the convergence concentrates nutrients which promotes marine plant life and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life <\s>
<s> in the spring of 2000 the international hydrographic organization decided to delimit the waters within the convergence as a fifth world ocean the southern ocean by combining the southern portions of the atlantic ocean indian ocean and pacific ocean <\s>
<s> the southern ocean extends from the coast of antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude which coincides with the antarctic treaty limit and which approximates the extent of the antarctic convergence <\s>
<s> as such the southern ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans after the pacific ocean atlantic ocean and indian ocean but larger than the arctic ocean <\s>

has shown that the antarctic circumpolar current acc an ocean current that flows from west to east around antarctica plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation <\s>
<s> the region where the cold waters of the acc meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border the antarctic convergence which fluctuates with the seasons but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region <\s>
<s> the convergence concentrates nutrients which promotes marine plant life and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life <\s>
<s> in the spring of 2000 the international hydrographic organization decided to delimit the waters within the convergence as a fifth world ocean the southern ocean by combining the southern portions of the atlantic ocean indian ocean and pacific ocean <\s>
<s> the southern ocean extends from the coast of antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude which coincides with the antarctic treaty limit and which approximates the extent of the antarctic convergence <\s>
<s> as such the southern ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans after the pacific ocean atlantic ocean and indian ocean but larger than the arctic ocean <\s>

has shown that the antarctic circumpolar current acc an ocean current that flows from west to east around antarctica plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation <\s>
<s> the region where the cold waters of the acc meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border the antarctic convergence which fluctuates with the seasons but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region <\s>
<s> the convergence concentrates nutrients which promotes marine plant life and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life <\s>
<s> in the spring of 2000 the international hydrographic organization decided to delimit the waters within the convergence as a fifth world ocean the southern ocean by combining the southern portions of the atlantic ocean indian ocean and pacific ocean <\s>
<s> the southern ocean extends from the coast of antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude which coincides with the antarctic treaty limit and which approximates the extent of the antarctic convergence <\s>
<s> as such the southern ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans after the pacific ocean atlantic ocean and indian ocean but larger than the arctic ocean <\s>

has shown that the antarctic circumpolar current acc an ocean current that flows from west to east around antarctica plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation <\s>
<s> the region where the cold waters of the acc meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border the antarctic convergence which fluctuates with the seasons but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region <\s>
<s> the convergence concentrates nutrients which promotes marine plant life and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life <\s>
<s> in the spring of 2000 the international hydrographic organization decided to delimit the waters within the convergence as a fifth world ocean the southern ocean by combining the southern portions of the atlantic ocean indian ocean and pacific ocean <\s>
<s> the southern ocean extends from the coast of antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude which coincides with the antarctic treaty limit and which approximates the extent of the antarctic convergence <\s>
<s> as such the southern ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans after the pacific ocean atlantic ocean and indian ocean but larger than the arctic ocean <\s>

has shown that the antarctic circumpolar current acc an ocean current that flows from west to east around antarctica plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation <\s>
<s> the region where the cold waters of the acc meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border the antarctic convergence which fluctuates with the seasons but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region <\s>
<s> the convergence concentrates nutrients which promotes marine plant life and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life <\s>
<s> in the spring of 2000 the international hydrographic organization decided to delimit the waters within the convergence as a fifth world ocean the southern ocean by combining the southern portions of the atlantic ocean indian ocean and pacific ocean <\s>
<s> the southern ocean extends from the coast of antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude which coincides with the antarctic treaty limit and which approximates the extent of the antarctic convergence <\s>
<s> as such the southern ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans after the pacific ocean atlantic ocean and indian ocean but larger than the arctic ocean <\s>

has shown that the antarctic circumpolar current acc an ocean current that flows from west to east around antarctica plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation <\s>
<s> the region where the cold waters of the acc meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border the antarctic convergence which fluctuates with the seasons but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region <\s>
<s> the convergence concentrates nutrients which promotes marine plant life and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life <\s>
<s> in the spring of 2000 the international hydrographic organization decided to delimit the waters within the convergence as a fifth world ocean the southern ocean by combining the southern portions of the atlantic ocean indian ocean and pacific ocean <\s>
<s> the southern ocean extends from the coast of antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude which coincides with the antarctic treaty limit and which approximates the extent of the antarctic convergence <\s>
<s> as such the southern ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans after the pacific ocean atlantic ocean and indian ocean but larger than the arctic ocean <\s>

has shown that the antarctic circumpolar current acc an ocean current that flows from west to east around antarctica plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation <\s>
<s> the region where the cold waters of the acc meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border the antarctic convergence which fluctuates with the seasons but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region <\s>
<s> the convergence concentrates nutrients which promotes marine plant life and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life <\s>
<s> in the spring of 2000 the international hydrographic organization decided to delimit the waters within the convergence as a fifth world ocean the southern ocean by combining the southern portions of the atlantic ocean indian ocean and pacific ocean <\s>
<s> the southern ocean extends from the coast of antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude which coincides with the antarctic treaty limit and which approximates the extent of the antarctic convergence <\s>
<s> as such the southern ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans after the pacific ocean atlantic ocean and indian ocean but larger than the arctic ocean <\s>

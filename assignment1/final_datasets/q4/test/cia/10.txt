updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>
<s> in october 2009 an irish referendum approved the treaty overturning a previous rejection and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement the czech republic signed on soon after <\s>
<s> treaty implementation began on 1 december 2009 <\s>
<s> in 2010 the prospect of a greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the emu and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed <\s>

introduction :: fiji background fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a british colony <\s>
<s> democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the indian community descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the british in the 19th century <\s>
<s> the coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native melanesian control of fiji led to heavy indian emigration the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that melanesians became the majority <\s>
<s> a new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable <\s>
<s> free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an indo-fijian but a civilian-led coup in may 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil <\s>
<s> parliamentary elections held in august 2001 provided fiji with a democratically elected government led by prime minister laisenia qarase <\s>
<s> re-elected in may 2006 qarase was ousted in a december 2006 military coup led by commodore voreqe bainimarama who initially appointed himself acting president but in january 2007 became interim prime minister <\s>
<s> since taking power bainimarama has neutralized his opponents crippled fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections <\s>

updated on january 20 2011 @european union europe introduction :: european union preliminary statement the evolution of the european union eu from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the european continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history <\s>
<s> dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in europe <\s>
<s> on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and the austro-hungarian empire were examples but for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique <\s>
<s> although the eu is not a federation in the strict sense it is far more than a free-trade association such as asean nafta or mercosur and it has many of the attributes associated with independent nations its own flag anthem founding date and currency as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations <\s>
<s> in the future many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded <\s>
<s> thus inclusion of basic intelligence on the eu has been deemed appropriate as a new separate entity in the world factbook <\s>
<s> however because of the eu's special status this description is placed after the regular country entries <\s>
<s> background following the two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century a number of european leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations france and germany both economically and politically <\s>
<s> in 1950 the french foreign minister robert schuman proposed an eventual union of all europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of western europe <\s>
<s> the following year the european coal and steel community ecsc was set up when six members belgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands signed the treaty of paris <\s>
<s> the ecsc was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries economies <\s>
<s> in 1957 the treaties of rome created the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market <\s>
<s> in 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the european community ec creating a single commission a single council of ministers and the european parliament <\s>
<s> members of the european parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since <\s>
<s> in 1973 the first enlargement of the ec took place with the addition of denmark ireland and the united kingdom <\s>
<s> the 1980s saw further membership expansion with greece joining in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 <\s>
<s> the 1992 treaty of maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union including a common currency <\s>
<s> this further integration created the european union eu <\s>
<s> in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu raising the membership total to 15 <\s>
<s> a new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 january 1999 it became the unit of exchange for all of the eu states except the united kingdom sweden and denmark <\s>
<s> in 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries the european monetary union or emu began using the euro banknotes and coins <\s>
<s> ten new countries joined the eu in 2004 cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia and in 2007 bulgaria and romania joined bringing the current membership to 27 <\s>
<s> in order to ensure that the eu can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the treaty of nice in force as of 1 february 2003 set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of eu institutions <\s>
<s> an effort to establish an eu constitution begun in october 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification <\s>
<s> a new effort undertaken in june 2007 created an intergovernmental conference to formulate a political agreement initially known as the reform treaty but subsequently referred to as the treaty of lisbon which would serve as a constitution <\s>
<s> unlike the constitution however the treaty of lisbon sought to amend existing treaties rather than replace them <\s>

<s> gdp grew 0.5 in 2008-09 <\s>
<s> the slowdown in the faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid 1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6 mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming and high export prices <\s>
<s> unemployment reached its lowest level in the first half of 2008 but increased to 3.9 in 2009 and is rising <\s>
<s> the faroese home rule government produced increasing budget surpluses that helped to reduce the large public debt most of it to denmark <\s>
<s> however total dependence on fishing and salmon farming make the faroese economy very vulnerable to fluctuations in world demand <\s>
<s> in addition budget surpluses turned to deficits in 2008-09 and the economy at both the country and local level is running large deficits <\s>

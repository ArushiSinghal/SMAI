<s> this is the measure most economists prefer when looking at per-capita welfare and when comparing living conditions or use of resources across countries <\s>
<s> the measure is difficult to compute as a us dollar value has to be assigned to all goods and services in the country regardless of whether these goods and services have a direct equivalent in the united states for example the value of an ox-cart or non-us military equipment ); as a result ppp estimates for some countries are based on a small and sometimes different set of goods and services <\s>
<s> in addition many countries do not formally participate in the world bank's ppp project that calculates these measures so the resulting gdp estimates for these countries may lack precision <\s>

<s> gdp methodology in the economy category gdp dollar estimates for countries are reported both on an official exchange rate oer and a purchasing power parity ppp basis <\s>
<s> both measures contain information that is useful to the reader <\s>
<s> the ppp method involves the use of standardized international dollar price weights which are applied to the quantities of final goods and services produced in a given economy <\s>
<s> the data derived from the ppp method probably provide the best available starting point for comparisons of economic strength and well-being between countries <\s>
<s> in contrast the currency exchange rate method involves a variety of international and domestic financial forces that may not capture the value of domestic output <\s>
<s> whereas ppp estimates for oecd countries are quite reliable ppp estimates for developing countries are often rough approximations <\s>
<s> in developing countries with weak currencies the exchange rate estimate of gdp in dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the ppp estimate <\s>
<s> most of the gdp estimates for developing countries are based on extrapolation of ppp numbers published by the un international comparison program unicp and by professors robert summers and alan heston of the university of pennsylvania and their colleagues <\s>
<s> gdp derived using the oer method should be used for the purpose of calculating the share of items such as exports imports military expenditures external debt or the current account balance because the dollar values presented in the factbook for these items have been converted at official exchange rates not at ppp <\s>
<s> one should use the oer gdp figure to calculate the proportion of say chinese defense expenditures in gdp because that share will be the same as one calculated in local currency units <\s>
<s> comparison of oer gdp with ppp gdp may also indicate whether a currency is over or under-valued <\s>

<s> g gdp official exchange rate this entry gives the gross domestic product gdp or value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year <\s>
<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>
<s> gdp purchasing power parity this entry gives the gross domestic product gdp or value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year <\s>
<s> a nation's gdp at purchasing power parity ppp exchange rates is the sum value of all goods and services produced in the country valued at prices prevailing in the united states <\s>
<s> this is the measure most economists prefer when looking at per-capita welfare and when comparing living conditions or use of resources across countries <\s>
<s> the measure is difficult to compute as a us dollar value has to be assigned to all goods and services in the country regardless of whether these goods and services have a direct equivalent in the united states for example the value of an ox-cart or non-us military equipment ); as a result ppp estimates for some countries are based on a small and sometimes different set of goods and services <\s>
<s> in addition many countries do not formally participate in the world bank's ppp project that calculates these measures so the resulting gdp estimates for these countries may lack precision <\s>
<s> for many developing countries ppp-based gdp measures are multiples of the official exchange rate oer measure <\s>
<s> the differences between the oer and ppp-denominated gdp values for most of the wealthy industrialized countries are generally much smaller <\s>
<s> gdp composition by sector this entry gives the percentage contribution of agriculture industry and services to total gdp <\s>
<s> the distribution will total less than 100 percent if the data are incomplete <\s>
<s> gdp per capita ppp this entry shows gdp on a purchasing power parity basis divided by population as of 1 july for the same year <\s>
<s> gdp real growth rate this entry gives gdp growth on an annual basis adjusted for inflation and expressed as a percent <\s>
<s> gdp methodology in the economy category gdp dollar estimates for countries are reported both on an official exchange rate oer and a purchasing power parity ppp basis <\s>
<s> both measures contain information that is useful to the reader <\s>
<s> the ppp method involves the use of standardized international dollar price weights which are applied to the quantities of final goods and services produced in a given economy <\s>
<s> the data derived from the ppp method probably provide the best available starting point for comparisons of economic strength and well-being between countries <\s>
<s> in contrast the currency exchange rate method involves a variety of international and domestic financial forces that may not capture the value of domestic output <\s>
<s> whereas ppp estimates for oecd countries are quite reliable ppp estimates for developing countries are often rough approximations <\s>
<s> in developing countries with weak currencies the exchange rate estimate of gdp in dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the ppp estimate <\s>
<s> most of the gdp estimates for developing countries are based on extrapolation of ppp numbers published by the un international comparison program unicp and by professors robert summers and alan heston of the university of pennsylvania and their colleagues <\s>
<s> gdp derived using the oer method should be used for the purpose of calculating the share of items such as exports imports military expenditures external debt or the current account balance because the dollar values presented in the factbook for these items have been converted at official exchange rates not at ppp <\s>
<s> one should use the oer gdp figure to calculate the proportion of say chinese defense expenditures in gdp because that share will be the same as one calculated in local currency units <\s>
<s> comparison of oer gdp with ppp gdp may also indicate whether a currency is over or under-valued <\s>
<s> if oer gdp is smaller than ppp gdp the official exchange rate may be undervalued and vice versa <\s>
<s> however there is no strong historical evidence that market exchange rates move in the direction implied by the ppp rate at least not in the short or medium-term <\s>

<s> the measure is difficult to compute as a us dollar value has to be assigned to all goods and services in the country regardless of whether these goods and services have a direct equivalent in the united states for example the value of an ox-cart or non-us military equipment ); as a result ppp estimates for some countries are based on a small and sometimes different set of goods and services <\s>

<s> most of the gdp estimates for developing countries are based on extrapolation of ppp numbers published by the un international comparison program unicp and by professors robert summers and alan heston of the university of pennsylvania and their colleagues <\s>
<s> gdp derived using the oer method should be used for the purpose of calculating the share of items such as exports imports military expenditures external debt or the current account balance because the dollar values presented in the factbook for these items have been converted at official exchange rates not at ppp <\s>
<s> one should use the oer gdp figure to calculate the proportion of say chinese defense expenditures in gdp because that share will be the same as one calculated in local currency units <\s>
<s> comparison of oer gdp with ppp gdp may also indicate whether a currency is over or under-valued <\s>

<s> this is the measure most economists prefer when looking at per-capita welfare and when comparing living conditions or use of resources across countries <\s>
<s> the measure is difficult to compute as a us dollar value has to be assigned to all goods and services in the country regardless of whether these goods and services have a direct equivalent in the united states for example the value of an ox-cart or non-us military equipment ); as a result ppp estimates for some countries are based on a small and sometimes different set of goods and services <\s>
<s> in addition many countries do not formally participate in the world bank's ppp project that calculates these measures so the resulting gdp estimates for these countries may lack precision <\s>

<s> the data derived from the ppp method probably provide the best available starting point for comparisons of economic strength and well-being between countries <\s>
<s> in contrast the currency exchange rate method involves a variety of international and domestic financial forces that may not capture the value of domestic output <\s>
<s> whereas ppp estimates for oecd countries are quite reliable ppp estimates for developing countries are often rough approximations <\s>

<s> most of the gdp estimates for developing countries are based on extrapolation of ppp numbers published by the un international comparison program unicp and by professors robert summers and alan heston of the university of pennsylvania and their colleagues <\s>
<s> gdp derived using the oer method should be used for the purpose of calculating the share of items such as exports imports military expenditures external debt or the current account balance because the dollar values presented in the factbook for these items have been converted at official exchange rates not at ppp <\s>
<s> one should use the oer gdp figure to calculate the proportion of say chinese defense expenditures in gdp because that share will be the same as one calculated in local currency units <\s>
<s> comparison of oer gdp with ppp gdp may also indicate whether a currency is over or under-valued <\s>

<s> gdp derived using the oer method should be used for the purpose of calculating the share of items such as exports imports military expenditures external debt or the current account balance because the dollar values presented in the factbook for these items have been converted at official exchange rates not at ppp <\s>
<s> one should use the oer gdp figure to calculate the proportion of say chinese defense expenditures in gdp because that share will be the same as one calculated in local currency units <\s>

<s> the measure is difficult to compute as a us dollar value has to be assigned to all goods and services in the country regardless of whether these goods and services have a direct equivalent in the united states for example the value of an ox-cart or non-us military equipment ); as a result ppp estimates for some countries are based on a small and sometimes different set of goods and services <\s>

<s> gdp derived using the oer method should be used for the purpose of calculating the share of items such as exports imports military expenditures external debt or the current account balance because the dollar values presented in the factbook for these items have been converted at official exchange rates not at ppp <\s>
<s> one should use the oer gdp figure to calculate the proportion of say chinese defense expenditures in gdp because that share will be the same as one calculated in local currency units <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>

<s> gdp purchasing power parity this entry gives the gross domestic product gdp or value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year <\s>
<s> a nation's gdp at purchasing power parity ppp exchange rates is the sum value of all goods and services produced in the country valued at prices prevailing in the united states <\s>
<s> this is the measure most economists prefer when looking at per-capita welfare and when comparing living conditions or use of resources across countries <\s>
<s> the measure is difficult to compute as a us dollar value has to be assigned to all goods and services in the country regardless of whether these goods and services have a direct equivalent in the united states for example the value of an ox-cart or non-us military equipment ); as a result ppp estimates for some countries are based on a small and sometimes different set of goods and services <\s>
<s> in addition many countries do not formally participate in the world bank's ppp project that calculates these measures so the resulting gdp estimates for these countries may lack precision <\s>
<s> for many developing countries ppp-based gdp measures are multiples of the official exchange rate oer measure <\s>

<s> gdp real growth rate this entry gives gdp growth on an annual basis adjusted for inflation and expressed as a percent <\s>
<s> gdp methodology in the economy category gdp dollar estimates for countries are reported both on an official exchange rate oer and a purchasing power parity ppp basis <\s>
<s> both measures contain information that is useful to the reader <\s>
<s> the ppp method involves the use of standardized international dollar price weights which are applied to the quantities of final goods and services produced in a given economy <\s>
<s> the data derived from the ppp method probably provide the best available starting point for comparisons of economic strength and well-being between countries <\s>
<s> in contrast the currency exchange rate method involves a variety of international and domestic financial forces that may not capture the value of domestic output <\s>
<s> whereas ppp estimates for oecd countries are quite reliable ppp estimates for developing countries are often rough approximations <\s>
<s> in developing countries with weak currencies the exchange rate estimate of gdp in dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the ppp estimate <\s>
<s> most of the gdp estimates for developing countries are based on extrapolation of ppp numbers published by the un international comparison program unicp and by professors robert summers and alan heston of the university of pennsylvania and their colleagues <\s>
<s> gdp derived using the oer method should be used for the purpose of calculating the share of items such as exports imports military expenditures external debt or the current account balance because the dollar values presented in the factbook for these items have been converted at official exchange rates not at ppp <\s>
<s> one should use the oer gdp figure to calculate the proportion of say chinese defense expenditures in gdp because that share will be the same as one calculated in local currency units <\s>
<s> comparison of oer gdp with ppp gdp may also indicate whether a currency is over or under-valued <\s>
<s> if oer gdp is smaller than ppp gdp the official exchange rate may be undervalued and vice versa <\s>
<s> however there is no strong historical evidence that market exchange rates move in the direction implied by the ppp rate at least not in the short or medium-term <\s>

<s> this is the measure most economists prefer when looking at per-capita welfare and when comparing living conditions or use of resources across countries <\s>
<s> the measure is difficult to compute as a us dollar value has to be assigned to all goods and services in the country regardless of whether these goods and services have a direct equivalent in the united states for example the value of an ox-cart or non-us military equipment ); as a result ppp estimates for some countries are based on a small and sometimes different set of goods and services <\s>

<s> gdp methodology in the economy category gdp dollar estimates for countries are reported both on an official exchange rate oer and a purchasing power parity ppp basis <\s>

<s> the ppp method involves the use of standardized international dollar price weights which are applied to the quantities of final goods and services produced in a given economy <\s>
<s> the data derived from the ppp method probably provide the best available starting point for comparisons of economic strength and well-being between countries <\s>
<s> in contrast the currency exchange rate method involves a variety of international and domestic financial forces that may not capture the value of domestic output <\s>
<s> whereas ppp estimates for oecd countries are quite reliable ppp estimates for developing countries are often rough approximations <\s>

<s> most of the gdp estimates for developing countries are based on extrapolation of ppp numbers published by the un international comparison program unicp and by professors robert summers and alan heston of the university of pennsylvania and their colleagues <\s>
<s> gdp derived using the oer method should be used for the purpose of calculating the share of items such as exports imports military expenditures external debt or the current account balance because the dollar values presented in the factbook for these items have been converted at official exchange rates not at ppp <\s>
<s> one should use the oer gdp figure to calculate the proportion of say chinese defense expenditures in gdp because that share will be the same as one calculated in local currency units <\s>
<s> comparison of oer gdp with ppp gdp may also indicate whether a currency is over or under-valued <\s>

<s> the measure is difficult to compute as a us dollar value has to be assigned to all goods and services in the country regardless of whether these goods and services have a direct equivalent in the united states for example the value of an ox-cart or non-us military equipment ); as a result ppp estimates for some countries are based on a small and sometimes different set of goods and services <\s>

<s> gdp derived using the oer method should be used for the purpose of calculating the share of items such as exports imports military expenditures external debt or the current account balance because the dollar values presented in the factbook for these items have been converted at official exchange rates not at ppp <\s>
<s> one should use the oer gdp figure to calculate the proportion of say chinese defense expenditures in gdp because that share will be the same as one calculated in local currency units <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>

<s> a nation's gdp at purchasing power parity ppp exchange rates is the sum value of all goods and services produced in the country valued at prices prevailing in the united states <\s>
<s> this is the measure most economists prefer when looking at per-capita welfare and when comparing living conditions or use of resources across countries <\s>
<s> the measure is difficult to compute as a us dollar value has to be assigned to all goods and services in the country regardless of whether these goods and services have a direct equivalent in the united states for example the value of an ox-cart or non-us military equipment ); as a result ppp estimates for some countries are based on a small and sometimes different set of goods and services <\s>
<s> in addition many countries do not formally participate in the world bank's ppp project that calculates these measures so the resulting gdp estimates for these countries may lack precision <\s>
<s> for many developing countries ppp-based gdp measures are multiples of the official exchange rate oer measure <\s>

<s> gdp methodology in the economy category gdp dollar estimates for countries are reported both on an official exchange rate oer and a purchasing power parity ppp basis <\s>
<s> both measures contain information that is useful to the reader <\s>
<s> the ppp method involves the use of standardized international dollar price weights which are applied to the quantities of final goods and services produced in a given economy <\s>
<s> the data derived from the ppp method probably provide the best available starting point for comparisons of economic strength and well-being between countries <\s>
<s> in contrast the currency exchange rate method involves a variety of international and domestic financial forces that may not capture the value of domestic output <\s>
<s> whereas ppp estimates for oecd countries are quite reliable ppp estimates for developing countries are often rough approximations <\s>
<s> in developing countries with weak currencies the exchange rate estimate of gdp in dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the ppp estimate <\s>
<s> most of the gdp estimates for developing countries are based on extrapolation of ppp numbers published by the un international comparison program unicp and by professors robert summers and alan heston of the university of pennsylvania and their colleagues <\s>
<s> gdp derived using the oer method should be used for the purpose of calculating the share of items such as exports imports military expenditures external debt or the current account balance because the dollar values presented in the factbook for these items have been converted at official exchange rates not at ppp <\s>
<s> one should use the oer gdp figure to calculate the proportion of say chinese defense expenditures in gdp because that share will be the same as one calculated in local currency units <\s>
<s> comparison of oer gdp with ppp gdp may also indicate whether a currency is over or under-valued <\s>
<s> if oer gdp is smaller than ppp gdp the official exchange rate may be undervalued and vice versa <\s>

<s> g gdp official exchange rate this entry gives the gross domestic product gdp or value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year <\s>
<s> a nation's gdp at official exchange rates oer is the home-currency-denominated annual gdp figure divided by the bilateral average us exchange rate with that country in that year <\s>
<s> the measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output <\s>
<s> many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace <\s>
<s> official exchange rates however can be artificially fixed and or subject to manipulation resulting in claims of the country having an under or over-valued currency and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate <\s>
<s> moreover even if the official exchange rate is market-determined market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services the ones the country trades and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces <\s>
<s> furthermore oer-converted gdp is not well suited to comparing domestic gdp over time since appreciation depreciation from one year to the next will make the oer gdp value rise fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated gdp changed <\s>
<s> gdp purchasing power parity this entry gives the gross domestic product gdp or value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year <\s>
<s> a nation's gdp at purchasing power parity ppp exchange rates is the sum value of all goods and services produced in the country valued at prices prevailing in the united states <\s>
<s> this is the measure most economists prefer when looking at per-capita welfare and when comparing living conditions or use of resources across countries <\s>
<s> the measure is difficult to compute as a us dollar value has to be assigned to all goods and services in the country regardless of whether these goods and services have a direct equivalent in the united states for example the value of an ox-cart or non-us military equipment ); as a result ppp estimates for some countries are based on a small and sometimes different set of goods and services <\s>
<s> in addition many countries do not formally participate in the world bank's ppp project that calculates these measures so the resulting gdp estimates for these countries may lack precision <\s>
<s> for many developing countries ppp-based gdp measures are multiples of the official exchange rate oer measure <\s>
<s> the differences between the oer and ppp-denominated gdp values for most of the wealthy industrialized countries are generally much smaller <\s>
<s> gdp composition by sector this entry gives the percentage contribution of agriculture industry and services to total gdp <\s>
<s> the distribution will total less than 100 percent if the data are incomplete <\s>
<s> gdp per capita ppp this entry shows gdp on a purchasing power parity basis divided by population as of 1 july for the same year <\s>
<s> gdp real growth rate this entry gives gdp growth on an annual basis adjusted for inflation and expressed as a percent <\s>
<s> gdp methodology in the economy category gdp dollar estimates for countries are reported both on an official exchange rate oer and a purchasing power parity ppp basis <\s>
<s> both measures contain information that is useful to the reader <\s>
<s> the ppp method involves the use of standardized international dollar price weights which are applied to the quantities of final goods and services produced in a given economy <\s>
<s> the data derived from the ppp method probably provide the best available starting point for comparisons of economic strength and well-being between countries <\s>
<s> in contrast the currency exchange rate method involves a variety of international and domestic financial forces that may not capture the value of domestic output <\s>
<s> whereas ppp estimates for oecd countries are quite reliable ppp estimates for developing countries are often rough approximations <\s>
<s> in developing countries with weak currencies the exchange rate estimate of gdp in dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the ppp estimate <\s>
<s> most of the gdp estimates for developing countries are based on extrapolation of ppp numbers published by the un international comparison program unicp and by professors robert summers and alan heston of the university of pennsylvania and their colleagues <\s>
<s> gdp derived using the oer method should be used for the purpose of calculating the share of items such as exports imports military expenditures external debt or the current account balance because the dollar values presented in the factbook for these items have been converted at official exchange rates not at ppp <\s>
<s> one should use the oer gdp figure to calculate the proportion of say chinese defense expenditures in gdp because that share will be the same as one calculated in local currency units <\s>
<s> comparison of oer gdp with ppp gdp may also indicate whether a currency is over or under-valued <\s>
<s> if oer gdp is smaller than ppp gdp the official exchange rate may be undervalued and vice versa <\s>
<s> however there is no strong historical evidence that market exchange rates move in the direction implied by the ppp rate at least not in the short or medium-term <\s>

<s> the measure is difficult to compute as a us dollar value has to be assigned to all goods and services in the country regardless of whether these goods and services have a direct equivalent in the united states for example the value of an ox-cart or non-us military equipment ); as a result ppp estimates for some countries are based on a small and sometimes different set of goods and services <\s>

<s> most of the gdp estimates for developing countries are based on extrapolation of ppp numbers published by the un international comparison program unicp and by professors robert summers and alan heston of the university of pennsylvania and their colleagues <\s>
<s> gdp derived using the oer method should be used for the purpose of calculating the share of items such as exports imports military expenditures external debt or the current account balance because the dollar values presented in the factbook for these items have been converted at official exchange rates not at ppp <\s>
<s> one should use the oer gdp figure to calculate the proportion of say chinese defense expenditures in gdp because that share will be the same as one calculated in local currency units <\s>
<s> comparison of oer gdp with ppp gdp may also indicate whether a currency is over or under-valued <\s>

<s> most of the gdp estimates for developing countries are based on extrapolation of ppp numbers published by the un international comparison program unicp and by professors robert summers and alan heston of the university of pennsylvania and their colleagues <\s>
<s> gdp derived using the oer method should be used for the purpose of calculating the share of items such as exports imports military expenditures external debt or the current account balance because the dollar values presented in the factbook for these items have been converted at official exchange rates not at ppp <\s>
<s> one should use the oer gdp figure to calculate the proportion of say chinese defense expenditures in gdp because that share will be the same as one calculated in local currency units <\s>
<s> comparison of oer gdp with ppp gdp may also indicate whether a currency is over or under-valued <\s>
<s> if oer gdp is smaller than ppp gdp the official exchange rate may be undervalued and vice versa <\s>
<s> however there is no strong historical evidence that market exchange rates move in the direction implied by the ppp rate at least not in the short or medium-term <\s>

<s> he began the day thus because there was not time to go far afield before his lessons <\s>
<s> the old tree's variety never staled it had mainmast foremast top gallant mast and he could always come down by the halyards or ropes of the swing <\s>
<s> after his lessons completed by eleven he would go to the kitchen for a thin piece of cheese a biscuit and two french plums provision enough for a jolly boat at least and eat it in some imaginative way then armed to the teeth with gun pistols and sword he would begin the serious climbing of the morning encountering by the way innumerable slavers indians pirates leopards and bears <\s>
<s> he was seldom seen at that hour of the day without a cutlass in his teeth like dick needham amid the rapid explosion of copper caps <\s>
<s> and many were the gardeners he brought down with yellow peas shot out of his little gun <\s>
<s> he lived a life of the most violent action <\s>
<s> jon said his father to his mother under the oak tree is terrible <\s>
<s> i'm afraid he's going to turn out a sailor or something hopeless <\s>
<s> do you see any sign of his appreciating beauty <\s>
<s> well thank heaven he's no turn for wheels or engines <\s>
<s> i can bear anything but that <\s>
<s> but i wish he'd take more interest in nature <\s>
<s> yes in a sanguinary way <\s>
<s> does he love anyone just now <\s>
<s> there never was anyone born more loving or more lovable than jon <\s>
<s> being your boy irene <\s>
<s> at this moment little jon lying along a branch high above them brought them down with two peas but that fragment of talk lodged thick in his small gizzard <\s>
<s> loving lovable imaginative sanguinary <\s>
<s> the leaves also were thick by now and it was time for his birthday which occurring every year on the twelfth of may was always memorable for his chosen dinner of sweetbread mushrooms macaroons and ginger beer <\s>
<s> between that eighth birthday however and the afternoon when he stood in the july radiance at the turning of the stairway several important things had happened <\s>
<s> da worn out by washing his knees or moved by that mysterious instinct which forces even nurses to desert their nurslings left the very day after his birthday in floods of tears to be married of all things to a man <\s>
<s> little jon from whom it had been kept was inconsolable for an afternoon <\s>
<s> it ought not to have been kept from him <\s>
<s> two large boxes of soldiers and some artillery together with the young buglers which had been among his birthday presents cooperated with his grief in a sort of conversion and instead of seeking adventures in person and risking his own life he began to play imaginative games in which he risked the lives of countless tin soldiers marbles stones and beans <\s>
<s> of these forms of chair a canon he made collections and using them alternately fought the peninsular the seven years the thirty years and other wars about which he had been reading of late in a big history of europe which had been his grandfather's <\s>
<s> he altered them to suit his genius and fought them all over the floor in his day nursery so that nobody could come in for fearing of disturbing gustavus adolphus king of sweden or treading on an army of austrians <\s>
<s> because of the sound of the word he was passionately addicted to the austrians and finding there were so few battles in which they were successful he had to invent them in his games <\s>
<s> his favourite generals were prince eugene the archduke charles and wallenstein <\s>
<s> tilly and mack music hall turns he heard his father call them one day whatever that might mean one really could not love very much austrian though they were <\s>
<s> for euphonic reasons too he doted on turenne <\s>
<s> this phase which caused his parents anxiety because it kept him indoors when he ought to have been out lasted through may and half of june till his father killed it by bringing home to him tom sawyer and huckleberry finn <\s>
<s> when he read those books something happened in him and he went out of doors again in passionate quest of a river <\s>
<s> there being none on the premises at robin hill he had to make one out of the pond which fortunately had water lilies dragonflies gnats bullrushes and three small willow trees <\s>
<s> on this pond after his father and garratt had ascertained by sounding that it had a reliable bottom and was nowhere more than two feet deep he was allowed a little collapsible canoe in which he spent hours and hours paddling and lying down out of sight of indian joe and other enemies <\s>
<s> on the shore of the pond too he built himself a wigwam about four feet square of old biscuit tins roofed in by boughs <\s>
<s> in this he would make little fires and cook the birds he had not shot with his gun hunting in the coppice and fields or the fish he did not catch in the pond because there were none <\s>
<s> this occupied the rest of june and that july when his father and mother were away in ireland <\s>
<s> he led a lonely life of make believe during those five weeks of summer weather with gun wigwam water and canoe and however hard his active little brain tried to keep the sense of beauty away she did creep in on him for a second now and then perching on the wing of a dragon fly glistening on the water lilies or brushing his eyes with her blue as he lay on his back in ambush <\s>
<s> auntie june who had been left in charge had a grown up in the house with a cough and a large piece of putty which he was making into a face so she hardly ever came down to see him in the pond <\s>
<s> once however she brought with her two other grown ups <\s>
<s> little jon who happened to have painted his naked self bright blue and yellow in stripes out of his father's water colour box and put some duck's feathers in his hair saw them coming and ambushed himself among the willows <\s>
<s> as he had foreseen they came at once to his wigwam and knelt down to look inside so that with a blood curdling yell he was able to take the scalps of auntie june and the woman grown up in an almost complete manner before they kissed him <\s>
<s> the names of the two grown ups were auntie holly and uncle val who had a brown face and a little limp and laughed at him terribly <\s>
<s> he took a fancy to auntie holly who seemed to be a sister too but they both went away the same afternoon and he did not see them again <\s>
<s> three days before his father and mother were to come home auntie june also went off in a great hurry taking the grown up who coughed and his piece of putty and mademoiselle said poor man he was veree ill <\s>
<s> i forbid you to go into his room jon <\s>
<s> little jon who rarely did things merely because he was told not to refrained from going though he was bored and lonely <\s>
<s> in truth the day of the pond was past and he was filled to the brim of his soul with restlessness and the want of something not a tree not a gun something soft <\s>

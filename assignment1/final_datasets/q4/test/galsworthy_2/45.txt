<s> kneeling down and plunging his face into the bed little jon hurried up under his breath opening one eye now and then to see her standing perfectly still with a smile on her face <\s>

<s> he sprang and for a long minute remained in her arms <\s>
<s> once in bed he continued to hold her hand <\s>
<s> you won't shut the door any more than that will you <\s>
<s> are you going to be long mum <\s>
<s> i must go down and play to daddy <\s>
<s> well i shall hear you <\s>
<s> i hope not you must go to sleep <\s>
<s> i can sleep any night <\s>
<s> well this is just a night like any other <\s>
<s> on extra special nights one always sleeps soundest <\s>
<s> but if i go to sleep mum i shan't hear you come up <\s>
<s> well when i do i'll come in and give you a kiss then if you're awake you'll know and if you're not you'll still know you've had one <\s>
<s> little jon sighed all right <\s>
<s> he said i suppose i must put up with that <\s>
<s> what was her name that daddy believes in <\s>
<s> but i like my name for you much better <\s>
<s> what is yours jon <\s>
<s> little jon answered shyly guinevere <\s>
<s> it's out of the round table i've only just thought of it only of course her hair was down <\s>
<s> his mother's eyes looking past him seemed to float <\s>
<s> you won't forget to come mum <\s>
<s> not if you'll go to sleep <\s>
<s> that's a bargain then <\s>
<s> she moved differently from anybody else especially from bella she was certainly the refinedest looking person he had ever seen <\s>
<s> she finished the trunk at last and knelt down in front of him <\s>
<s> have you missed us jon <\s>
<s> little jon nodded and having thus admitted his feelings continued to nod <\s>
<s> but you had auntie june <\s>
<s> she had a man with a cough <\s>
<s> his mother's face changed and looked almost angry <\s>
<s> he added hastily he was a poor man mum he coughed awfully i i liked him <\s>
<s> his mother put her hands behind his waist <\s>
<s> you like everybody jon <\s>
<s> up to a point he said auntie june took me to church one sunday <\s>
<s> she wanted to see how it would affect me <\s>
<s> i came over all funny so she took me home again very quick <\s>
<s> i wasn't sick after all <\s>
<s> i went to bed and had hot brandy and water and read the boys of beechwood <\s>
<s> his mother bit her lip <\s>
<s> about a long time ago i wanted her to take me again but she wouldn't <\s>
<s> you and daddy never go to church do you <\s>
<s> well dear we both of us went when we were little <\s>
<s> perhaps we went when we were too little <\s>
<s> i see said little jon it's dangerous <\s>
<s> you shall judge for yourself about all those things as you grow up <\s>
<s> little jon replied in a calculating manner i don't want to grow up much <\s>
<s> i don't want to go to school <\s>
<s> a sudden overwhelming desire to say something more to say what he really felt turned him red <\s>
<s> i i want to stay with you and be your lover mum <\s>
<s> then with an instinct to improve the situation he added quickly i don't want to go to bed to night either <\s>
<s> i'm simply tired of going to bed every night <\s>
<s> have you had any more nightmares <\s>
<s> may i leave the door open into your room to night mum <\s>
<s> yes just a little <\s>
<s> little jon heaved a sigh of satisfaction <\s>
<s> what did you see in glensofantrim <\s>
<s> nothing but beauty darling <\s>
<s> what exactly is beauty <\s>
<s> jon that's a poser <\s>
<s> can i see it for instance <\s>
<s> his mother got up and sat beside him <\s>
<s> you do every day <\s>
<s> the sky is beautiful the stars and moonlit nights and then the birds the flowers the trees they're all beautiful <\s>
<s> look out of the window there's beauty for you jon <\s>
<s> yes that's the view <\s>
<s> the sea is wonderfully beautiful and the waves with their foam flying back <\s>
<s> did you rise from it every day mum <\s>
<s> little jon suddenly reached out and caught her neck in his hands <\s>
<s> i know he said mysteriously you're it really and all the rest is make believe <\s>
<s> she sighed laughed said oh <\s>
<s> little jon said critically do you think bella beautiful for instance <\s>
<s> bella is young that's something <\s>
<s> but you look younger mum <\s>
<s> if you bump against bella she hurts <\s>
<s> i don't believe da was beautiful when i come to think of it and mademoiselle's almost ugly <\s>
<s> mademoiselle has a very nice face <\s>
<s> i love your little rays mum <\s>
<s> little jon put his finger to the outer corner of her eye <\s>
<s> but they're a sign of age <\s>
<s> they come when you smile <\s>
<s> but they usen't to <\s>
<s> well i like them <\s>
<s> do you love me mum <\s>
<s> i do i do love you darling <\s>
<s> more than i thought you did <\s>
<s> well so do i so that makes it even <\s>
<s> conscious that he had never in his life so given himself away he felt a sudden reaction to the manliness of sir lamorac dick needham huck finn and other heroes <\s>
<s> shall i show you a thing or two <\s>
<s> he said and slipping out of her arms he stood on his head <\s>
<s> then fired by her obvious admiration he mounted the bed and threw himself head foremost from his feet on to his back without touching anything with his hands <\s>
<s> he did this several times <\s>
<s> that evening having inspected what they had brought he stayed up to dinner sitting between them at the little round table they used when they were alone <\s>
<s> he was extremely excited <\s>
<s> his mother wore a french grey dress with creamy lace made out of little scriggly roses round her neck which was browner than the lace <\s>
<s> he kept looking at her till at last his father's funny smile made him suddenly attentive to his slice of pineapple <\s>
<s> it was later than he had ever stayed up when he went to bed <\s>
<s> his mother went up with him and he undressed very slowly so as to keep her there <\s>
<s> when at last he had nothing on but his pyjamas he said promise you won't go while i say my prayers <\s>

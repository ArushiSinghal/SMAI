<s> the most he could ever have said to his son would have been look here old man don't forget you're a gentleman and then have wondered whimsically whether that was not a snobbish sentiment <\s>
<s> the great cricket match was perhaps the most searching and awkward time they annually went through together for jolyon had been at eton <\s>
<s> they would be particularly careful during that match continually saying hooray <\s>
<s> hard luck old man <\s>
<s> to each other when some disaster at which their hearts bounded happened to the opposing school <\s>
<s> and jolyon would wear a grey top hat instead of his usual soft one to save his son's feelings for a black top hat he could not stomach <\s>
<s> when jolly went up to oxford jolyon went up with him amused humble and a little anxious not to discredit his boy amongst all these youths who seemed so much more assured and old than himself <\s>
<s> he often thought glad i'm a painter for he had long dropped under writing at lloyds 'it's so innocuous <\s>
<s> you can't look down on a painter you can't take him seriously enough <\s>
<s> for jolly who had a sort of natural lordliness had passed at once into a very small set who secretly amused his father <\s>
<s> the boy had fair hair which curled a little and his grandfather's deepset iron grey eyes <\s>
<s> he was well built and very upright and always pleased jolyon's aesthetic sense so that he was a tiny bit afraid of him as artists ever are of those of their own sex whom they admire physically <\s>
<s> on that occasion however he actually did screw up his courage to give his son advice and this was it look here old man you're bound to get into debt mind you come to me at once <\s>
<s> of course i'll always pay them <\s>
<s> but you might remember that one respects oneself more afterwards if one pays one's own way <\s>
<s> and don't ever borrow except from me will you <\s>
<s> and jolly had said all right dad i won't and he never had <\s>
<s> and there's just one other thing <\s>
<s> i don't know much about morality and that but there is this it's always worth while before you do anything to consider whether it's going to hurt another person more than is absolutely necessary <\s>
<s> jolly had looked thoughtful and nodded and presently had squeezed his father's hand <\s>
<s> and jolyon had thought i wonder if i had the right to say that <\s>
<s> he always had a sort of dread of losing the dumb confidence they had in each other remembering how for long years he had lost his own father's so that there had been nothing between them but love at a great distance <\s>
<s> he under estimated no doubt the change in the spirit of the age since he himself went up to cambridge in 65 and perhaps he underestimated too his boy's power of understanding that he was tolerant to the very bone <\s>
<s> it was that tolerance of his and possibly his scepticism which ever made his relations towards june so queerly defensive <\s>
<s> she was such a decided mortal knew her own mind so terribly well wanted things so inexorably until she got them and then indeed often dropped them like a hot potato <\s>
<s> her mother had been like that whence had come all those tears <\s>
<s> not that his incompatibility with his daughter was anything like what it had been with the first mrs <\s>
<s> one could be amused where a daughter was concerned in a wife's case one could not be amused <\s>
<s> to see june set her heart and jaw on a thing until she got it was all right because it was never anything which interfered fundamentally with jolyon's liberty the one thing on which his jaw was also absolutely rigid a considerable jaw under that short grizzling beard <\s>
<s> nor was there ever any necessity for real heart to heart encounters <\s>
<s> one could break away into irony as indeed he often had to <\s>
<s> but the real trouble with june was that she had never appealed to his aesthetic sense though she might well have with her red gold hair and her viking coloured eyes and that touch of the berserker in her spirit <\s>
<s> it was very different with holly soft and quiet shy and affectionate with a playful imp in her somewhere <\s>
<s> he watched this younger daughter of his through the duckling stage with extraordinary interest <\s>
<s> would she come out a swan <\s>
<s> with her sallow oval face and her grey wistful eyes and those long dark lashes she might or she might not <\s>
<s> only this last year had he been able to guess <\s>
<s> yes she would be a swan rather a dark one always a shy one but an authentic swan <\s>
<s> she was eighteen now and mademoiselle beauce was gone the excellent lady had removed after eleven years haunted by her continuous reminiscences of the well brrred little tayleurs to another family whose bosom would now be agitated by her reminiscences of the well brrred little forsytes <\s>
<s> she had taught holly to speak french like herself <\s>
<s> portraiture was not jolyon's forte but he had already drawn his younger daughter three times and was drawing her a fourth on the afternoon of october 4th 1899 when a card was brought to him which caused his eyebrows to go up mr <\s>

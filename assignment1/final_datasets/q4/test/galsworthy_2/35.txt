<s> if you don't i .... <\s>
<s> there was a moment of silence and suspense so awful that he could hear the sound of a mowing machine far out on the lawn pretending there was grass to cut <\s>
<s> then she swayed forward her free hand touched his hair and he gasped oh holly <\s>
<s> her answer was very soft oh val <\s>
<s> he had dreamed of this moment but always in an imperative mood as the masterful young lover and now he felt humble touched trembly <\s>
<s> he was afraid to stir off his knees lest he should break the spell lest if he did she should shrink and deny her own surrender so tremulous was she in his grasp with her eyelids closed and his lips nearing them <\s>
<s> her eyes opened seemed to swim a little he pressed his lips to hers <\s>
<s> suddenly he sprang up there had been footsteps a sort of startled grunt <\s>
<s> but the long curtains which barred off the outer hall were quivering <\s>
<s> holly too was on her feet <\s>
<s> jolly i expect she whispered <\s>
<s> val clenched fists and resolution <\s>
<s> he said i don't care a bit now we're engaged and striding towards the curtains he drew them aside <\s>
<s> there at the fireplace in the hall stood jolly with his back elaborately turned <\s>
<s> jolly faced round on him <\s>
<s> i beg your pardon for hearing he said <\s>
<s> with the best intentions in the world val could not help admiring him at that moment his face was clear his voice quiet he looked somehow distinguished as if acting up to principle <\s>
<s> val said abruptly it's nothing to you <\s>
<s> said jolly you come this way and he crossed the hall <\s>
<s> at the study door he felt a touch on his arm holly's voice said i'm coming too <\s>
<s> jolly opened the door and they all three went in <\s>
<s> once in the little room they stood in a sort of triangle on three corners of the worn turkey carpet awkwardly upright not looking at each other quite incapable of seeing any humour in the situation <\s>
<s> val broke the silence <\s>
<s> holly and i are engaged <\s>
<s> jolly stepped back and leaned against the lintel of the window <\s>
<s> this is our house he said i'm not going to insult you in it <\s>
<s> but my father's away <\s>
<s> i'm in charge of my sister <\s>
<s> you've taken advantage of me <\s>
<s> i didn't mean to said val hotly <\s>
<s> i think you did said jolly <\s>
<s> if you hadn't meant to you'd have spoken to me or waited for my father to come back <\s>
<s> there were reasons said val <\s>
<s> about my family i've just told her <\s>
<s> i wanted her to know before things happen <\s>
<s> jolly suddenly became less distinguished <\s>
<s> you're kids he said and you know you are <\s>
<s> i am not a kid said val <\s>
<s> you are you're not twenty <\s>
<s> well what are you <\s>
<s> i am twenty said jolly <\s>

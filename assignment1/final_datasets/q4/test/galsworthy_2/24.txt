<s> i have been to richmond last sunday <\s>
<s> soames went through a moment of calculating struggle <\s>
<s> after all dared he go so far as that and show her what there was to look forward to <\s>
<s> down there one could say things <\s>
<s> in this room it was impossible <\s>
<s> i want you and your mother he said suddenly to come for the afternoon next sunday <\s>
<s> my house is on the river it's not too late in this weather and i can show you some good pictures <\s>
<s> what do you say <\s>
<s> annette clasped her hands <\s>
<s> it will be lovelee <\s>
<s> the river is so beautiful that's understood then <\s>
<s> he need say no more to her this evening and risk giving himself away <\s>
<s> but had he not already said too much <\s>
<s> did one ask restaurant proprietors with pretty daughters down to one's country house without design <\s>
<s> madame lamotte would see if annette didn't <\s>
<s> there was not much that madame did not see <\s>
<s> besides this was the second time he had stayed to supper with them he owed them hospitality <\s>
<s> walking home towards park lane for he was staying at his father's with the impression of annette's soft clever hand within his own his thoughts were pleasant slightly sensual rather puzzled <\s>
<s> dirty linen washed in public <\s>
<s> with his reputation for sagacity for far sightedness and the clever extrication of others he who stood for proprietary interests to become the plaything of that law of which he was a pillar <\s>
<s> there was something revolting in the thought <\s>
<s> winifred's affair was bad enough <\s>
<s> to have a double dose of publicity in the family <\s>
<s> would not a liaison be better than that a liaison and a son he could adopt <\s>
<s> but dark solid watchful madame lamotte blocked the avenue of that vision <\s>
<s> that would not work <\s>
<s> it was not as if annette could have a real passion for him one could not expect that at his age <\s>
<s> if her mother wished if the worldly advantage were manifestly great perhaps <\s>
<s> if not refusal would be certain <\s>
<s> besides he thought i'm not a villain <\s>
<s> i don't want to hurt her and i don't want anything underhand <\s>
<s> but i do want her and i want a son <\s>
<s> there's nothing for it but divorce somehow anyhow divorce <\s>
<s> under the shadow of the plane trees in the lamplight he passed slowly along the railings of the green park <\s>
<s> mist clung there among the bluish tree shapes beyond range of the lamps <\s>
<s> how many hundred times he had walked past those trees from his father's house in park lane when he was quite a young man or from his own house in montpellier square in those four years of married life <\s>
<s> and to night making up his mind to free himself if he could of that long useless marriage tie he took a fancy to walk on in at hyde park corner out at knightsbridge gate just as he used to when going home to irene in the old days <\s>
<s> what could she be like now how had she passed the years since he last saw her twelve years in all seven already since uncle jolyon left her that money <\s>
<s> was she still beautiful <\s>
<s> would he know her if he saw her <\s>
<s> i've not changed much he thought i expect she has <\s>
<s> she made me suffer <\s>
<s> he remembered suddenly one night the first on which he went out to dinner alone an old malburian dinner the first year of their marriage <\s>
<s> with what eagerness he had hurried back and entering softly as a cat had heard her playing <\s>
<s> opening the drawing room door noiselessly he had stood watching the expression on her face different from any he knew so much more open so confiding as though to her music she was giving a heart he had never seen <\s>

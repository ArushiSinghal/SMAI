<s> he laid emphasis on the words and again looked james in the face <\s>
<s> a feeling of its being too dangerous to take a step in any direction or hazard any remark had fallen on them all <\s>
<s> something of the sense of the impending that comes over the spectator of a greek tragedy had entered that upholstered room filled with those white haired frock coated old men and fashionably attired women who were all of the same blood between all of whom existed an unseizable resemblance <\s>
<s> not that they were conscious of it the visits of such fateful bitter spirits are only felt <\s>
<s> he would not sit there feeling like that he was not to be put down by anyone <\s>
<s> and manoeuvring round the room with added pomp he shook hands with each separately <\s>
<s> you tell timothy from me he said that he coddles himself too much <\s>
<s> then turning to francie whom he considered smart he added you come with me for a drive one of these days <\s>
<s> but this conjured up the vision of that other eventful drive which had been so much talked about and he stood quite still for a second with glassy eyes as though waiting to catch up with the significance of what he himself had said then suddenly recollecting that he didn't care a damn he turned to old jolyon well good bye jolyon <\s>
<s> you shouldn't go about without an overcoat you'll be getting sciatica or something <\s>
<s> and kicking the cat slightly with the pointed tip of his patent leather boot he took his huge form away <\s>
<s> when he had gone everyone looked secretly at the others to see how they had taken the mention of the word drive' the word which had become famous and acquired an overwhelming importance as the only official so to speak news in connection with the vague and sinister rumour clinging to the family tongue <\s>
<s> euphemia yielding to an impulse said with a short laugh i'm glad uncle swithin doesn't ask me to go for drives <\s>
<s> small to reassure her and smooth over any little awkwardness the subject might have replied my dear he likes to take somebody well dressed who will do him a little credit <\s>
<s> i shall never forget the drive he took me <\s>
<s> it was an experience <\s>
<s> and her chubby round old face was spread for a moment with a strange contentment then broke into pouts and tears came into her eyes <\s>
<s> she was thinking of that long ago driving tour she had once taken with septimus small <\s>
<s> james who had relapsed into his nervous brooding in the little chair suddenly roused himself he's a funny fellow swithin he said but in a half hearted way <\s>
<s> old jolyon's silence his stern eyes held them all in a kind of paralysis <\s>
<s> he was disconcerted himself by the effect of his own words an effect which seemed to deepen the importance of the very rumour he had come to scotch but he was still angry <\s>
<s> he had not done with them yet no no he would give them another rub or two <\s>
<s> he did not wish to rub his nieces he had no quarrel with them a young and presentable female always appealed to old jolyon's clemency but that fellow james and in a less degree perhaps those others deserved all they would get <\s>
<s> and he too asked for timothy <\s>
<s> as though feeling that some danger threatened her younger brother aunt juley suddenly offered him tea there it is she said all cold and nasty waiting for you in the back drawing room but smither shall make you some fresh <\s>
<s> old jolyon rose thank you he said looking straight at james but i've no time for tea and scandal and the rest of it <\s>
<s> it's time i was at home <\s>
<s> good bye julia good bye hester good bye winifred <\s>
<s> without more ceremonious adieux he marched out <\s>
<s> once again in his cab his anger evaporated for so it ever was with his wrath when he had rapped out it was gone <\s>
<s> sadness came over his spirit <\s>
<s> he had stopped their mouths maybe but at what a cost <\s>
<s> at the cost of certain knowledge that the rumour he had been resolved not to believe was true <\s>
<s> june was abandoned and for the wife of that fellow's son <\s>
<s> he felt it was true and hardened himself to treat it as if it were not but the pain he hid beneath this resolution began slowly surely to vent itself in a blind resentment against james and his son <\s>
<s> the six women and one man left behind in the little drawing room began talking as easily as might be after such an occurrence for though each one of them knew for a fact that he or she never talked scandal each one of them also knew that the other six did all were therefore angry and at a loss <\s>
<s> james only was silent disturbed to the bottom of his soul <\s>
<s> presently francie said do you know i think uncle jolyon is terribly changed this last year <\s>
<s> what do you think aunt hester <\s>
<s> aunt hester made a little movement of recoil oh ask your aunt julia <\s>
<s> she said i know nothing about it <\s>
<s> no one else was afraid of assenting and james muttered gloomily at the floor he's not half the man he was <\s>
<s> i've noticed it a long time went on francie he's aged tremendously <\s>
<s> aunt juley shook her head her face seemed suddenly to have become one immense pout <\s>
<s> poor dear jolyon she said somebody ought to see to it for him <\s>
<s> there was again silence then as though in terror of being left solitarily behind all five visitors rose simultaneously and took their departure <\s>
<s> small aunt hester and their cat were left once more alone the sound of a door closing in the distance announced the approach of timothy <\s>
<s> that evening when aunt hester had just got off to sleep in the back bedroom that used to be aunt juley's before aunt juley took aunt ann's her door was opened and mrs <\s>
<s> small in a pink night cap a candle in her hand entered hester <\s>
<s> aunt hester faintly rustled the sheet <\s>
<s> hester repeated aunt juley to make quite sure that she had awakened her i am quite troubled about poor dear jolyon <\s>
<s> what aunt juley dwelt on the word do you think ought to be done <\s>
<s> aunt hester again rustled the sheet her voice was heard faintly pleading done <\s>
<s> how should i know <\s>
<s> aunt juley turned away satisfied and closing the door with extra gentleness so as not to disturb dear hester let it slip through her fingers and fall to with a crack <\s>
<s> back in her own room she stood at the window gazing at the moon over the trees in the park through a chink in the muslin curtains close drawn lest anyone should see <\s>
<s> and there with her face all round and pouting in its pink cap and her eyes wet she thought of dear jolyon so old and so lonely and how she could be of some use to him and how he would come to love her as she had never been loved since since poor septimus went away <\s>

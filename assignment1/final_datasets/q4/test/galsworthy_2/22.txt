<s> this almost formal abdication of fatherhood hurt him <\s>
<s> the morning light fell on a face which worked with real emotion <\s>
<s> nothing so false as penitence moved him but genuine paternal feeling and that melancholy of never again <\s>
<s> he moistened his lips and complete irresolution for a moment paralysed his legs in their check trousers <\s>
<s> it was hard hard to be thus compelled to leave his home <\s>
<s> he muttered i never thought it would come to this <\s>
<s> noises above warned him that the maids were beginning to get up <\s>
<s> and grasping the two valises he tiptoed on downstairs <\s>
<s> his cheeks were wet and the knowledge of that was comforting as though it guaranteed the genuineness of his sacrifice <\s>
<s> he lingered a little in the rooms below to pack all the cigars he had some papers a crush hat a silver cigarette box a ruff's guide <\s>
<s> then mixing himself a stiff whisky and soda and lighting a cigarette he stood hesitating before a photograph of his two girls in a silver frame <\s>
<s> it belonged to winifred <\s>
<s> never mind he thought she can get another taken and i can't <\s>
<s> he slipped it into the valise <\s>
<s> then putting on his hat and overcoat he took two others his best malacca cane an umbrella and opened the front door <\s>
<s> closing it softly behind him he walked out burdened as he had never been in all his life and made his way round the corner to wait there for an early cab to come by <\s>
<s> thus had passed montague dartie in the forty fifth year of his age from the house which he had called his own <\s>
<s> when winifred came down and realised that he was not in the house her first feeling was one of dull anger that he should thus elude the reproaches she had carefully prepared in those long wakeful hours <\s>
<s> he had gone off to newmarket or brighton with that woman as likely as not <\s>
<s> forced to a complete reticence before imogen and the servants and aware that her father's nerves would never stand the disclosure she had been unable to refrain from going to timothy's that afternoon and pouring out the story of the pearls to aunts juley and hester in utter confidence <\s>
<s> it was only on the following morning that she noticed the disappearance of that photograph <\s>
<s> what did it mean <\s>
<s> careful examination of her husband's relics prompted the thought that he had gone for good <\s>
<s> as that conclusion hardened she stood quite still in the middle of his dressing room with all the drawers pulled out to try and realise what she was feeling <\s>
<s> by no means easy <\s>
<s> though he was the limit he was yet her property and for the life of her she could not but feel the poorer <\s>
<s> to be widowed yet not widowed at forty two with four children made conspicuous an object of commiseration <\s>
<s> gone to the arms of a spanish jade <\s>
<s> memories feelings which she had thought quite dead revived within her painful sullen tenacious <\s>
<s> mechanically she closed drawer after drawer went to her bed lay on it and buried her face in the pillows <\s>
<s> she did not cry <\s>
<s> what was the use of that <\s>
<s> when she got off her bed to go down to lunch she felt as if only one thing could do her good and that was to have val home <\s>
<s> he her eldest boy who was to go to oxford next month at james expense was at littlehampton taking his final gallops with his trainer for smalls as he would have phrased it following his father's diction <\s>
<s> she caused a telegram to be sent to him <\s>
<s> i must see about his clothes she said to imogen i can't have him going up to oxford all anyhow <\s>
<s> those boys are so particular <\s>
<s> val's got heaps of things imogen answered <\s>
<s> i know but they want overhauling <\s>
<s> i hope he'll come <\s>
<s> he'll come like a shot mother <\s>
<s> but he'll probably skew his exam <\s>
<s> i can't help that said winifred <\s>
<s> with an innocent shrewd look at her mother's face imogen kept silence <\s>
<s> it was father of course <\s>
<s> val did come like a shot at six o'clock <\s>
<s> imagine a cross between a pickle and a forsyte and you have young publius valerius dartie <\s>
<s> a youth so named could hardly turn out otherwise <\s>
<s> when he was born winifred in the heyday of spirits and the craving for distinction had determined that her children should have names such as no others had ever had <\s>
<s> it was a mercy she felt now that she had just not named imogen thisbe but it was to george forsyte always a wag that val's christening was due <\s>
<s> it so happened that dartie dining with him a week after the birth of his son and heir had mentioned this aspiration of winifred's <\s>
<s> call him cato said george it'll be damned piquant <\s>
<s> he had just won a tenner on a horse of that name <\s>
<s> dartie had replied they were a little on as the phrase was even in those days it's not a christian name <\s>
<s> george called to a waiter in knee breeches <\s>
<s> bring me the encyc'pedia brit <\s>
<s> from the library letter c <\s>
<s> the waiter brought it <\s>
<s> said george pointing with his cigar cato publius valerius by virgil out of lydia <\s>
<s> that's what you want <\s>
<s> publius valerius is christian enough <\s>
<s> dartie on arriving home had informed winifred <\s>
<s> she had been charmed <\s>
<s> it was so chic <\s>
<s> and publius valerius became the baby's name though it afterwards transpired that they had got hold of the inferior cato <\s>
<s> in 1890 however when little publius was nearly ten the word chic went out of fashion and sobriety came in winifred began to have doubts <\s>
<s> they were confirmed by little publius himself who returned from his first term at school complaining that life was a burden to him they called him pubby <\s>
<s> winifred a woman of real decision promptly changed his school and his name to val the publius being dropped even as an initial <\s>
<s> at nineteen he was a limber freckled youth with a wide mouth light eyes long dark lashes a rather charming smile considerable knowledge of what he should not know and no experience of what he ought to do <\s>
<s> few boys had more narrowly escaped being expelled the engaging rascal <\s>
<s> after kissing his mother and pinching imogen he ran upstairs three at a time and came down four dressed for dinner <\s>
<s> he was awfully sorry but his trainer who had come up too had asked him to dine at the oxford and cambridge it wouldn't do to miss the old chap would be hurt <\s>
<s> winifred let him go with an unhappy pride <\s>
<s> she had wanted him at home but it was very nice to know that his tutor was so fond of him <\s>
<s> he went out with a wink at imogen saying i say mother could i have two plover's eggs when i come in cook's got some <\s>
<s> they top up so jolly well <\s>
<s> and look here have you any money i had to borrow a fiver from old snobby <\s>
<s> winifred looking at him with fond shrewdness answered my dear you are naughty about money <\s>
<s> but you shouldn't pay him to night anyway you're his guest <\s>
<s> how nice and slim he looked in his white waistcoat and his dark thick lashes <\s>
<s> oh but we may go to the theatre you see mother and i think i ought to stand the tickets he's always hard up you know <\s>
<s> winifred produced a five pound note saying well perhaps you'd better pay him but you mustn't stand the tickets too <\s>
<s> val pocketed the fiver <\s>
<s> if i do i can't he said <\s>
<s> he went out with his head up and his hat cocked joyously sniffing the air of piccadilly like a young hound loosed into covert <\s>
<s> after that mouldy old slow hole down there <\s>
<s> he found his tutor not indeed at the oxford and cambridge but at the goat's club <\s>

<s> soames in his capacity of executor received the guests for timothy still kept his bed he would get up after the funeral and aunts juley and hester would not be coming down till all was over when it was understood there would be lunch for anyone who cared to come back <\s>
<s> the next to arrive was roger still limping from the gout and encircled by three of his sons young roger eustace and thomas <\s>
<s> george the remaining son arrived almost immediately afterwards in a hansom and paused in the hall to ask soames how he found undertaking pay <\s>

<s> there seemed a sort of indecency in that blackness and in the colour of their gloves a sort of exaggeration of the feelings and many cast shocked looks of secret envy at the buccaneer who had no gloves and was wearing grey trousers <\s>
<s> a subdued hum of conversation rose no one speaking of the departed but each asking after the other as though thereby casting an indirect libation to this event which they had come to honour <\s>
<s> and presently james said well i think we ought to be starting <\s>
<s> they went downstairs and two and two as they had been told off in strict precedence mounted the carriages <\s>

<s> so long as the procession kept to the highway of the bayswater road it retained the foot's pace but turning into less important thorough fares it soon broke into a trot and so proceeded with intervals of walking in the more fashionable streets until it arrived <\s>
<s> in the first carriage old jolyon and nicholas were talking of their wills <\s>
<s> in the second the twins after a single attempt had lapsed into complete silence both were rather deaf and the exertion of making themselves heard was too great <\s>
<s> only once james broke this silence i shall have to be looking about for some ground somewhere <\s>
<s> what arrangements have you made swithin <\s>
<s> and swithin fixing him with a dreadful stare answered don't talk to me about such things <\s>
<s> in the third carriage a disjointed conversation was carried on in the intervals of looking out to see how far they had got george remarking well it was really time that the poor old lady went <\s>
<s> he didn't believe in people living beyond seventy young nicholas replied mildly that the rule didn't seem to apply to the forsytes <\s>

<s> soames hitherto silent here joined in he had not forgotten the remark about the undertaking and lifting his eyelids almost imperceptibly said it was all very well for people who never made money to talk <\s>
<s> he himself intended to live as long as he could <\s>
<s> this was a hit at george who was notoriously hard up <\s>
<s> bosinney muttered abstractedly hear hear <\s>
<s> and george yawning the conversation dropped <\s>
<s> upon arriving the coffin was borne into the chapel and two by two the mourners filed in behind it <\s>
<s> this guard of men all attached to the dead by the bond of kinship was an impressive and singular sight in the great city of london with its overwhelming diversity of life its innumerable vocations pleasures duties its terrible hardness its terrible call to individualism <\s>
<s> the family had gathered to triumph over all this to give a show of tenacious unity to illustrate gloriously that law of property underlying the growth of their tree by which it had thriven and spread trunk and branches the sap flowing through all the full growth reached at the appointed time <\s>

<s> it was her final appeal to that unity which had been their strength it was her final triumph that she had died while the tree was yet whole <\s>

<s> the same law that had worked in her bringing her up from a tall straight backed slip of a girl to a woman strong and grown from a woman grown to a woman old angular feeble almost witchlike with individuality all sharpened and sharpened as all rounding from the world's contact fell off from her that same law would work was working in the family she had watched like a mother <\s>
<s> she had seen it young and growing she had seen it strong and grown and before her old eyes had time or strength to see any more she died <\s>
<s> she would have tried and who knows but she might have kept it young and strong with her old fingers her trembling kisses a little longer alas <\s>
<s> not even aunt ann could fight with nature <\s>
<s> pride comes before a fall <\s>
<s> in accordance with this the greatest of nature's ironies the forsyte family had gathered for a last proud pageant before they fell <\s>
<s> their faces to right and left in single lines were turned for the most part impassively toward the ground guardians of their thoughts but here and there one looking upward with a line between his brows searched to see some sight on the chapel walls too much for him to be listening to something that appalled <\s>
<s> aunt hester the silent the patient that backwater of the family energy sat in the drawing room where the blinds were drawn and she too had wept at first but quietly without visible effect <\s>
<s> her guiding principle the conservation of energy did not abandon her in sorrow <\s>
<s> she sat slim motionless studying the grate her hands idle in the lap of her black silk dress <\s>
<s> they would want to rouse her into doing something no doubt <\s>
<s> as if there were any good in that <\s>
<s> doing something would not bring back ann <\s>
<s> five o'clock brought three of the brothers jolyon and james and swithin nicholas was at yarmouth and roger had a bad attack of gout <\s>
<s> hayman had been by herself earlier in the day and after seeing ann had gone away leaving a message for timothy which was kept from him that she ought to have been told sooner <\s>
<s> in fact there was a feeling amongst them all that they ought to have been told sooner as though they had missed something and james said i knew how it'd be i told you she wouldn't last through the summer <\s>
<s> aunt hester made no reply it was nearly october but what was the good of arguing some people were never satisfied <\s>
<s> she sent up to tell her sister that the brothers were there <\s>
<s> small came down at once <\s>
<s> she had bathed her face which was still swollen and though she looked severely at swithin's trousers for they were of light blue he had come straight from the club where the news had reached him she wore a more cheerful expression than usual the instinct for doing the wrong thing being even now too strong for her <\s>
<s> presently all five went up to look at the body <\s>
<s> under the pure white sheet a quilted counter pane had been placed for now more than ever aunt ann had need of warmth and the pillows removed her spine and head rested flat with the semblance of their life long inflexibility the coif banding the top of her brow was drawn on either side to the level of the ears and between it and the sheet her face almost as white was turned with closed eyes to the faces of her brothers and sisters <\s>
<s> in its extraordinary peace the face was stronger than ever nearly all bone now under the scarce wrinkled parchment of skin square jaw and chin cheekbones forehead with hollow temples chiselled nose the fortress of an unconquerable spirit that had yielded to death and in its upward sightlessness seemed trying to regain that spirit to regain the guardianship it had just laid down <\s>
<s> swithin took but one look at the face and left the room the sight he said afterwards made him very queer <\s>
<s> he went downstairs shaking the whole house and seizing his hat clambered into his brougham without giving any directions to the coachman <\s>
<s> he was driven home and all the evening sat in his chair without moving <\s>
<s> he could take nothing for dinner but a partridge with an imperial pint of champagne .... <\s>
<s> old jolyon stood at the bottom of the bed his hands folded in front of him <\s>
<s> he alone of those in the room remembered the death of his mother and though he looked at ann it was of that he was thinking <\s>
<s> ann was an old woman but death had come to her at last death came to all <\s>
<s> his face did not move his gaze seemed travelling from very far <\s>
<s> aunt hester stood beside him <\s>
<s> she did not cry now tears were exhausted her nature refused to permit a further escape of force she twisted her hands looking not at ann but from side to side seeking some way of escaping the effort of realization <\s>
<s> of all the brothers and sisters james manifested the most emotion <\s>
<s> tears rolled down the parallel furrows of his thin face where he should go now to tell his troubles he did not know juley was no good hester worse than useless <\s>
<s> he felt ann's death more than he had ever thought he should this would upset him for weeks <\s>
<s> presently aunt hester stole out and aunt juley began moving about doing what was necessary so that twice she knocked against something <\s>
<s> old jolyon roused from his reverie that reverie of the long long past looked sternly at her and went away <\s>
<s> james alone was left by the bedside glancing stealthily round to see that he was not observed he twisted his long body down placed a kiss on the dead forehead then he too hastily left the room <\s>
<s> encountering smither in the hall he began to ask her about the funeral and finding that she knew nothing complained bitterly that if they didn't take care everything would go wrong <\s>
<s> she had better send for mr <\s>
<s> soames he knew all about that sort of thing her master was very much upset he supposed he would want looking after as for her mistresses they were no good they had no gumption <\s>
<s> they would be ill too he shouldn't wonder <\s>
<s> she had better send for the doctor it was best to take things in time <\s>
<s> he didn't think his sister ann had had the best opinion if she'd had blank she would have been alive now <\s>
<s> smither might send to park lane any time she wanted advice <\s>
<s> of course his carriage was at their service for the funeral <\s>
<s> he supposed she hadn't such a thing as a glass of claret and a biscuit he had had no lunch <\s>
<s> the days before the funeral passed quietly <\s>
<s> it had long been known of course that aunt ann had left her little property to timothy <\s>
<s> there was therefore no reason for the slightest agitation <\s>
<s> soames who was sole executor took charge of all arrangements and in due course sent out the following invitation to every male member of the family to ........... <\s>
<s> your presence is requested at the funeral of miss ann forsyte in highgate cemetery at noon of oct <\s>
<s> carriages will meet at the bower bayswater road at 10.45 <\s>
<s> no flowers by request <\s>

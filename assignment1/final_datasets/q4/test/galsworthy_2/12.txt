<s> always in good spirits and full of information she was universally welcomed <\s>
<s> admitting the facts they raised a point on the correspondence which divested of legal phraseology amounted to this to speak of a free hand in the terms of this correspondence is an irish bull <\s>
<s> by a chance fortuitous but not improbable in the close borough of legal circles a good deal of information came to soames ear anent this line of policy the working partner in his firm bustard happening to sit next at dinner at walmisley's the taxing master to young chankery of the common law bar <\s>
<s> the necessity for talking what is known as shop which comes on all lawyers with the removal of the ladies caused chankery a young and promising advocate to propound an impersonal conundrum to his neighbour whose name he did not know for seated as he permanently was in the background bustard had practically no name <\s>
<s> he had said chankery a case coming on with a very nice point <\s>
<s> he then explained preserving every professional discretion the riddle in soames case <\s>
<s> everyone he said to whom he had spoken thought it a nice point <\s>
<s> the issue was small unfortunately though d  d serious for his client he believed' walmisley's champagne was bad but plentiful <\s>
<s> a judge would make short work of it he was afraid <\s>
<s> he intended to make a big effort the point was a nice one <\s>
<s> what did his neighbour say <\s>
<s> bustard a model of secrecy said nothing <\s>
<s> he related the incident to soames however with some malice for this quiet man was capable of human feeling ending with his own opinion that the point was a very nice one <\s>
<s> in accordance with his resolve our forsyte had put his interests into the hands of jobling and boulter <\s>
<s> from the moment of doing so he regretted that he had not acted for himself <\s>
<s> on receiving a copy of bosinney's defence he went over to their offices <\s>
<s> boulter who had the matter in hand jobling having died some years before told him that in his opinion it was rather a nice point he would like counsel's opinion on it <\s>
<s> soames told him to go to a good man and they went to waterbuck q c marking him ten and one who kept the papers six weeks and then wrote as follows in my opinion the true interpretation of this correspondence depends very much on the intention of the parties and will turn upon the evidence given at the trial <\s>
<s> i am of opinion that an attempt should be made to secure from the architect an admission that he understood he was not to spend at the outside more than twelve thousand and fifty pounds <\s>
<s> with regard to the expression a free hand in the terms of this correspondence to which my attention is directed the point is a nice one but i am of opinion that upon the whole the ruling in boileau v <\s>
<s> the blasted cement co ltd will apply <\s>
<s> upon this opinion they acted administering interrogatories but to their annoyance messrs <\s>
<s> freak and able answered these in so masterly a fashion that nothing whatever was admitted and that without prejudice <\s>
<s> it was on october 1 that soames read waterbuck's opinion in the dining room before dinner <\s>
<s> it made him nervous not so much because of the case of boileau v <\s>
<s> the blasted cement co ltd as that the point had lately begun to seem to him too a nice one there was about it just that pleasant flavour of subtlety so attractive to the best legal appetites <\s>
<s> to have his own impression confirmed by waterbuck q c would have disturbed any man <\s>
<s> he sat thinking it over and staring at the empty grate for though autumn had come the weather kept as gloriously fine that jubilee year as if it were still high august <\s>
<s> it was not pleasant to be disturbed he desired too passionately to set his foot on bosinney's neck <\s>
<s> though he had not seen the architect since the last afternoon at robin hill he was never free from the sense of his presence never free from the memory of his worn face with its high cheek bones and enthusiastic eyes <\s>
<s> it would not be too much to say that he had never got rid of the feeling of that night when he heard the peacock's cry at dawn the feeling that bosinney haunted the house <\s>
<s> and every man's shape that he saw in the dark evenings walking past seemed that of him whom george had so appropriately named the buccaneer <\s>
<s> irene still met him he was certain where or how he neither knew nor asked deterred by a vague and secret dread of too much knowledge <\s>
<s> it all seemed subterranean nowadays <\s>
<s> sometimes when he questioned his wife as to where she had been which he still made a point of doing as every forsyte should she looked very strange <\s>
<s> her self possession was wonderful but there were moments when behind the mask of her face inscrutable as it had always been to him lurked an expression he had never been used to see there <\s>
<s> she had taken to lunching out too when he asked bilson if her mistress had been in to lunch as often as not she would answer no sir <\s>
<s> he strongly disapproved of her gadding about by herself and told her so <\s>
<s> but she took no notice <\s>
<s> there was something that angered amazed yet almost amused him about the calm way in which she disregarded his wishes <\s>
<s> it was really as if she were hugging to herself the thought of a triumph over him <\s>
<s> he rose from the perusal of waterbuck q c s opinion and going upstairs entered her room for she did not lock her doors till bed time she had the decency he found to save the feelings of the servants <\s>
<s> she was brushing her hair and turned to him with strange fierceness <\s>
<s> what do you want <\s>
<s> please leave my room <\s>
<s> he answered i want to know how long this state of things between us is to last <\s>
<s> i have put up with it long enough <\s>
<s> will you please leave my room <\s>
<s> will you treat me as your husband <\s>
<s> then i shall take steps to make you <\s>
<s> he stared amazed at the calmness of her answer <\s>
<s> her lips were compressed in a thin line her hair lay in fluffy masses on her bare shoulders in all its strange golden contrast to her dark eyes those eyes alive with the emotions of fear hate contempt and odd haunting triumph <\s>
<s> now please will you leave my room <\s>
<s> he turned round and went sulkily out <\s>
<s> he knew very well that he had no intention of taking steps and he saw that she knew too knew that he was afraid to <\s>
<s> it was a habit with him to tell her the doings of his day how such and such clients had called how he had arranged a mortgage for parkes how that long standing suit of fryer v <\s>
<s> forsyte was getting on which arising in the preternaturally careful disposition of his property by his great uncle nicholas who had tied it up so that no one could get at it at all seemed likely to remain a source of income for several solicitors till the day of judgment <\s>
<s> and how he had called in at jobson's and seen a boucher sold which he had just missed buying of talleyrand and sons in pall mall <\s>
<s> he had an admiration for boucher watteau and all that school <\s>
<s> it was a habit with him to tell her all these matters and he continued to do it even now talking for long spells at dinner as though by the volubility of words he could conceal from himself the ache in his heart <\s>
<s> often if they were alone he made an attempt to kiss her when she said good night <\s>
<s> he may have had some vague notion that some night she would let him or perhaps only the feeling that a husband ought to kiss his wife <\s>
<s> even if she hated him he at all events ought not to put himself in the wrong by neglecting this ancient rite <\s>
<s> and why did she hate him <\s>
<s> even now he could not altogether believe it <\s>
<s> it was strange to be hated the emotion was too extreme yet he hated bosinney that buccaneer that prowling vagabond that night wanderer <\s>
<s> for in his thoughts soames always saw him lying in wait wandering <\s>
<s> ah but he must be in very low water <\s>

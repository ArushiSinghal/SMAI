<s> the un forsytean self sacrifice of his three children indeed had quite bewildered jolyon <\s>
<s> he would eagerly change places with jolly because he loved his boy but no such personal motive was influencing them <\s>
<s> he could only think that it marked the decline of the forsyte type <\s>
<s> late that afternoon holly came out to him under the old oak tree <\s>
<s> she had grown up very much during these last months of hospital training away from home <\s>
<s> and seeing her approach he thought she has more sense than june child though she is more wisdom <\s>
<s> thank god she isn't going out <\s>
<s> she had seated herself in the swing very silent and still <\s>
<s> she feels this thought jolyon as much as i and seeing her eyes fixed on him he said don't take it to heart too much my child <\s>
<s> if he weren't ill he might be in much greater danger <\s>
<s> holly got out of the swing <\s>
<s> i want to tell you something dad <\s>
<s> it was through me that jolly enlisted and went out <\s>
<s> when you were away in paris val dartie and i fell in love <\s>
<s> we used to ride in richmond park we got engaged <\s>
<s> jolly found it out and thought he ought to stop it so he dared val to enlist <\s>
<s> it was all my fault dad and i want to go out too <\s>
<s> because if anything happens to either of them i should feel awful <\s>
<s> besides i'm just as much trained as june <\s>
<s> jolyon gazed at her in a stupefaction that was tinged with irony <\s>
<s> so this was the answer to the riddle he had been asking himself and his three children were forsytes after all <\s>
<s> surely holly might have told him all this before <\s>
<s> but he smothered the sarcastic sayings on his lips <\s>
<s> tenderness to the young was perhaps the most sacred article of his belief <\s>
<s> he had got no doubt what he deserved <\s>
<s> so this was why he had so lost touch with her <\s>
<s> and to young val dartie nephew of soames in the other camp <\s>
<s> it was all terribly distasteful <\s>
<s> he closed his easel and set his drawing against the tree <\s>
<s> have you told june <\s>
<s> yes she says she'll get me into her cabin somehow <\s>
<s> it's a single cabin but one of us could sleep on the floor <\s>
<s> if you consent she'll go up now and get permission <\s>
<s> rather late in the day to ask for that <\s>
<s> but again he checked himself <\s>
<s> you're too young my dear they won't let you <\s>
<s> june knows some people that she helped to go to cape town <\s>
<s> if they won't let me nurse yet i could stay with them and go on training there <\s>
<s> let me go dad <\s>
<s> jolyon smiled because he could have cried <\s>
<s> i never stop anyone from doing anything he said <\s>
<s> holly flung her arms round his neck <\s>
<s> dad you are the best in the world <\s>
<s> that means the worst thought jolyon <\s>
<s> if he had ever doubted his creed of tolerance he did so then <\s>
<s> i'm not friendly with val's family he said and i don't know val but jolly didn't like him <\s>
<s> holly looked at the distance and said i love him <\s>
<s> that settles it said jolyon dryly then catching the expression on her face he kissed her with the thought is anything more pathetic than the faith of the young <\s>
<s> unless he actually forbade her going it was obvious that he must make the best of it so he went up to town with june <\s>
<s> whether due to her persistence or the fact that the official they saw was an old school friend of jolyon's they obtained permission for holly to share the single cabin <\s>
<s> he took them to surbiton station the following evening and they duly slid away from him provided with money invalid foods and those letters of credit without which forsytes do not travel <\s>
<s> he drove back to robin hill under a brilliant sky to his late dinner served with an added care by servants trying to show him that they sympathised eaten with an added scrupulousness to show them that he appreciated their sympathy <\s>
<s> but it was a real relief to get to his cigar on the terrace of flag stones cunningly chosen by young bosinney for shape and colour with night closing in around him so beautiful a night hardly whispering in the trees and smelling so sweet that it made him ache <\s>
<s> the grass was drenched with dew and he kept to those flagstones up and down till presently it began to seem to him that he was one of three not wheeling but turning right about at each end so that his father was always nearest to the house and his son always nearest to the terrace edge <\s>
<s> each had an arm lightly within his arm he dared not lift his hand to his cigar lest he should disturb them and it burned away dripping ash on him till it dropped from his lips at last which were getting hot <\s>
<s> they left him then and his arms felt chilly <\s>
<s> three jolyons in one jolyon they had walked <\s>
<s> he stood still counting the sounds a carriage passing on the highroad a distant train the dog at gage's farm the whispering trees the groom playing on his penny whistle <\s>
<s> a multitude of stars up there bright and silent so far off <\s>
<s> no moon as yet <\s>
<s> just enough light to show him the dark flags and swords of the iris flowers along the terrace edge his favourite flower that had the night's own colour on its curving crumpled petals <\s>
<s> he turned round to the house <\s>
<s> big unlighted not a soul beside himself to live in all that part of it <\s>
<s> he could not go on living here alone <\s>
<s> and yet so long as there was beauty why should a man feel lonely <\s>
<s> the answer as to some idiot's riddle was because he did <\s>
<s> the greater the beauty the greater the loneliness for at the back of beauty was harmony and at the back of harmony was union <\s>
<s> beauty could not comfort if the soul were out of it <\s>
<s> the night maddeningly lovely with bloom of grapes on it in starshine and the breath of grass and honey coming from it he could not enjoy while she who was to him the life of beauty its embodiment and essence was cut off from him utterly cut off now he felt by honourable decency <\s>
<s> he made a poor fist of sleeping striving too hard after that resignation which forsytes find difficult to reach bred to their own way and left so comfortably off by their fathers <\s>
<s> but after dawn he dozed off and soon was dreaming a strange dream <\s>
<s> he was on a stage with immensely high rich curtains high as the very stars stretching in a semi circle from footlights to footlights <\s>
<s> he himself was very small a little black restless figure roaming up and down and the odd thing was that he was not altogether himself but soames as well so that he was not only experiencing but watching <\s>
<s> this figure of himself and soames was trying to find a way out through the curtains which heavy and dark kept him in <\s>
<s> several times he had crossed in front of them before he saw with delight a sudden narrow rift a tall chink of beauty the colour of iris flowers like a glimpse of paradise remote ineffable <\s>
<s> stepping quickly forward to pass into it he found the curtains closing before him <\s>

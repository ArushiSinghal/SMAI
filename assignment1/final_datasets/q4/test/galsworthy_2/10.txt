<s> in the park the motley hour of mid afternoon when foreigners and other pathetic folk drive thinking themselves to be in fashion had passed the right the proper hour had come was nearly gone before soames and irene seated themselves under the achilles statue <\s>
<s> it was some time since he had enjoyed her company in the park <\s>
<s> that was one of the past delights of the first two seasons of his married life when to feel himself the possessor of this gracious creature before all london had been his greatest though secret pride <\s>
<s> how many afternoons had he not sat beside her extremely neat with light grey gloves and faint supercilious smile nodding to acquaintances and now and again removing his hat <\s>
<s> his light grey gloves were still on his hands and on his lips his smile sardonic but where the feeling in his heart <\s>
<s> the seats were emptying fast but still he kept her there silent and pale as though to work out a secret punishment <\s>
<s> once or twice he made some comment and she bent her head or answered yes with a tired smile <\s>
<s> along the rails a man was walking so fast that people stared after him when he passed <\s>
<s> look at that ass <\s>
<s> said soames he must be mad to walk like that in this heat <\s>
<s> he turned irene had made a rapid movement <\s>
<s> he said it's our friend the buccaneer <\s>
<s> and he sat still with his sneering smile conscious that irene was sitting still and smiling too <\s>
<s> will she bow to him <\s>
<s> but she made no sign <\s>
<s> bosinney reached the end of the rails and came walking back amongst the chairs quartering his ground like a pointer <\s>
<s> when he saw them he stopped dead and raised his hat <\s>
<s> the smile never left soames face he also took off his hat <\s>
<s> bosinney came up looking exhausted like a man after hard physical exercise the sweat stood in drops on his brow and soames smile seemed to say you've had a trying time my friend .... <\s>
<s> what are _you_ doing in the park <\s>

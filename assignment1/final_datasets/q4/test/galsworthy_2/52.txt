<s> shall i take up the matter of that nuisance in old compton street <\s>
<s> he guaranteed as it were irresponsibility to numerous forsytes of the third and fourth generations <\s>
<s> his fellow trustees such as his cousins roger or nicholas his cousins in law tweetyman and spender or his sister cicely's husband all trusted him he signed first and where he signed first they signed after and nobody was a penny the worse <\s>
<s> just now they were all a good many pennies the better and soames was beginning to see the close of certain trusts except for distribution of the income from securities as gilt edged as was compatible with the period <\s>
<s> passing the more feverish parts of the city toward the most perfect backwater in london he ruminated <\s>
<s> money was extraordinarily tight and morality extraordinarily loose <\s>
<s> the war had done it <\s>
<s> banks were not lending people breaking contracts all over the place <\s>
<s> there was a feeling in the air and a look on faces that he did not like <\s>
<s> the country seemed in for a spell of gambling and bankruptcies <\s>
<s> there was satisfaction in the thought that neither he nor his trusts had an investment which could be affected by anything less maniacal than national repudiation or a levy on capital <\s>
<s> if soames had faith it was in what he called english common sense or the power to have things if not one way then another <\s>
<s> he might like his father james before him say he didn't know what things were coming to but he never in his heart believed they were <\s>
<s> if it rested with him they wouldn't and after all he was only an englishman like any other so quietly tenacious of what he had that he knew he would never really part with it without something more or less equivalent in exchange <\s>
<s> his mind was essentially equilibristic in material matters and his way of putting the national situation difficult to refute in a world composed of human beings <\s>
<s> take his own case for example <\s>
<s> he was well off <\s>
<s> did that do anybody harm <\s>
<s> he did not eat ten meals a day he ate no more than perhaps not so much as a poor man <\s>
<s> he spent no money on vice breathed no more air used no more water to speak of than the mechanic or the porter <\s>
<s> he certainly had pretty things about him but they had given employment in the making and somebody must use them <\s>
<s> he bought pictures but art must be encouraged <\s>
<s> he was in fact an accidental channel through which money flowed employing labour <\s>
<s> what was there objectionable in that <\s>
<s> in his charge money was in quicker and more useful flux than it would be in charge of the state and a lot of slow fly money sucking officials <\s>
<s> and as to what he saved each year it was just as much in flux as what he didn't save going into water board or council stocks or something sound and useful <\s>
<s> the state paid him no salary for being trustee of his own or other people's money he did all that for nothing <\s>
<s> therein lay the whole case against nationalisation owners of private property were unpaid and yet had every incentive to quicken up the flux <\s>
<s> under nationalisation just the opposite <\s>
<s> in a country smarting from officialism he felt that he had a strong case <\s>
<s> it particularly annoyed him entering that backwater of perfect peace to think that a lot of unscrupulous trusts and combinations had been cornering the market in goods of all kinds and keeping prices at an artificial height <\s>
<s> such abusers of the individualistic system were the ruffians who caused all the trouble and it was some satisfaction to see them getting into a stew at last lest the whole thing might come down with a run and land them in the soup <\s>
<s> the offices of cuthcott kingson and forsyte occupied the ground and first floors of a house on the right hand side and ascending to his room soames thought time we had a coat of paint <\s>
<s> his old clerk gradman was seated where he always was at a huge bureau with countless pigeonholes <\s>
<s> half the clerk stood beside him with a broker's note recording investment of the proceeds from sale of the bryanston square house in roger forsyte's estate <\s>
<s> soames took it and said vancouver city stock <\s>
<s> with a sort of grating ingratiation old gradman answered him ye es but everything's down mr <\s>
<s> soames skewered the document on to a number of other papers and hung up his hat <\s>
<s> i want to look at my will and marriage settlement gradman <\s>
<s> old gradman moving to the limit of his swivel chair drew out two drafts from the bottom lefthand drawer <\s>
<s> recovering his body he raised his grizzle haired face very red from stooping <\s>
<s> it struck him suddenly how like gradman was to the stout brindled yard dog they had been wont to keep on his chain at the shelter till one day fleur had come and insisted it should be let loose so that it had at once bitten the cook and been destroyed <\s>
<s> if you let gradman off his chain would he bite the cook <\s>
<s> checking this frivolous fancy soames unfolded his marriage settlement <\s>
<s> he had not looked at it for over eighteen years not since he remade his will when his father died and fleur was born <\s>

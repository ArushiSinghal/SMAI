<s> on may 15 last the defendant wrote to the plaintiff requesting to be allowed to withdraw from his professional position in regard to the decoration of the plaintiff's house unless he were given a free hand <\s>
<s> the plaintiff on may 17 wrote back as follows in giving you in accordance with your request this free hand i wish you to clearly understand that the total cost of the house as handed over to me completely decorated inclusive of your fee as arranged between us must not exceed twelve thousand pounds <\s>
<s> to this letter the defendant replied on may 18 if you think that in such a delicate matter as decoration i can bind myself to the exact pound i am afraid you are mistaken <\s>
<s> on may 19 the plaintiff wrote as follows i did not mean to say that if you should exceed the sum named in my letter to you by ten or twenty or even fifty pounds there would be any difficulty between us <\s>
<s> you have a free hand in the terms of this correspondence and i hope you will see your way to completing the decorations <\s>
<s> on may 20 the defendant replied thus shortly very well <\s>
<s> in completing these decorations the defendant incurred liabilities and expenses which brought the total cost of this house up to the sum of twelve thousand four hundred pounds all of which expenditure has been defrayed by the plaintiff <\s>
<s> this action has been brought by the plaintiff to recover from the defendant the sum of three hundred and fifty pounds expended by him in excess of a sum of twelve thousand and fifty pounds alleged by the plaintiff to have been fixed by this correspondence as the maximum sum that the defendant had authority to expend <\s>
<s> the question for me to decide is whether or no the defendant is liable to refund to the plaintiff this sum <\s>
<s> in my judgment he is so liable <\s>
<s> what in effect the plaintiff has said is this i give you a free hand to complete these decorations provided that you keep within a total cost to me of twelve thousand pounds <\s>
<s> if you exceed that sum by as much as fifty pounds i will not hold you responsible beyond that point you are no agent of mine and i shall repudiate liability <\s>
<s> it is not quite clear to me whether had the plaintiff in fact repudiated liability under his agent's contracts he would under all the circumstances have been successful in so doing but he has not adopted this course <\s>
<s> he has accepted liability and fallen back upon his rights against the defendant under the terms of the latter's engagement <\s>
<s> in my judgment the plaintiff is entitled to recover this sum from the defendant <\s>
<s> it has been sought on behalf of the defendant to show that no limit of expenditure was fixed or intended to be fixed by this correspondence <\s>
<s> if this were so i can find no reason for the plaintiff's importation into the correspondence of the figures of twelve thousand pounds and subsequently of fifty pounds <\s>
<s> the defendant's contention would render these figures meaningless <\s>

<s> in completing these decorations the defendant incurred liabilities and expenses which brought the total cost of this house up to the sum of twelve thousand four hundred pounds all of which expenditure has been defrayed by the plaintiff <\s>

<s> he has accepted liability and fallen back upon his rights against the defendant under the terms of the latter's engagement <\s>
<s> in my judgment the plaintiff is entitled to recover this sum from the defendant <\s>

<s> on may 15 last the defendant wrote to the plaintiff requesting to be allowed to withdraw from his professional position in regard to the decoration of the plaintiff's house unless he were given a free hand <\s>
<s> the plaintiff on may 17 wrote back as follows in giving you in accordance with your request this free hand i wish you to clearly understand that the total cost of the house as handed over to me completely decorated inclusive of your fee as arranged between us must not exceed twelve thousand pounds <\s>
<s> to this letter the defendant replied on may 18 if you think that in such a delicate matter as decoration i can bind myself to the exact pound i am afraid you are mistaken <\s>
<s> on may 19 the plaintiff wrote as follows i did not mean to say that if you should exceed the sum named in my letter to you by ten or twenty or even fifty pounds there would be any difficulty between us <\s>
<s> you have a free hand in the terms of this correspondence and i hope you will see your way to completing the decorations <\s>
<s> on may 20 the defendant replied thus shortly very well <\s>
<s> in completing these decorations the defendant incurred liabilities and expenses which brought the total cost of this house up to the sum of twelve thousand four hundred pounds all of which expenditure has been defrayed by the plaintiff <\s>
<s> this action has been brought by the plaintiff to recover from the defendant the sum of three hundred and fifty pounds expended by him in excess of a sum of twelve thousand and fifty pounds alleged by the plaintiff to have been fixed by this correspondence as the maximum sum that the defendant had authority to expend <\s>
<s> the question for me to decide is whether or no the defendant is liable to refund to the plaintiff this sum <\s>
<s> in my judgment he is so liable <\s>
<s> what in effect the plaintiff has said is this i give you a free hand to complete these decorations provided that you keep within a total cost to me of twelve thousand pounds <\s>
<s> if you exceed that sum by as much as fifty pounds i will not hold you responsible beyond that point you are no agent of mine and i shall repudiate liability <\s>
<s> it is not quite clear to me whether had the plaintiff in fact repudiated liability under his agent's contracts he would under all the circumstances have been successful in so doing but he has not adopted this course <\s>
<s> he has accepted liability and fallen back upon his rights against the defendant under the terms of the latter's engagement <\s>
<s> in my judgment the plaintiff is entitled to recover this sum from the defendant <\s>
<s> it has been sought on behalf of the defendant to show that no limit of expenditure was fixed or intended to be fixed by this correspondence <\s>
<s> if this were so i can find no reason for the plaintiff's importation into the correspondence of the figures of twelve thousand pounds and subsequently of fifty pounds <\s>
<s> the defendant's contention would render these figures meaningless <\s>

<s> in completing these decorations the defendant incurred liabilities and expenses which brought the total cost of this house up to the sum of twelve thousand four hundred pounds all of which expenditure has been defrayed by the plaintiff <\s>

<s> he has accepted liability and fallen back upon his rights against the defendant under the terms of the latter's engagement <\s>
<s> in my judgment the plaintiff is entitled to recover this sum from the defendant <\s>

<s> if his lordship had had the opportunity that he himself had made it his duty to take to go over this very fine house and see the great delicacy and beauty of the decorations executed by his client an artist in his most honourable profession he felt convinced that not for one moment would his lordship tolerate this he would use no stronger word than daring attempt to evade legitimate responsibility <\s>
<s> taking the text of soames letters he lightly touched on boileau v <\s>
<s> the blasted cement company limited <\s>
<s> it is doubtful he said what that authority has decided in any case i would submit that it is just as much in my favour as in my friend's <\s>
<s> he then argued the nice point closely <\s>
<s> with all due deference he submitted that mr <\s>
<s> forsyte's expression nullified itself <\s>
<s> his client not being a rich man the matter was a serious one for him he was a very talented architect whose professional reputation was undoubtedly somewhat at stake <\s>
<s> he concluded with a perhaps too personal appeal to the judge as a lover of the arts to show himself the protector of artists from what was occasionally he said occasionally the too iron hand of capital <\s>
<s> what he said will be the position of the artistic professions if men of property like this mr <\s>
<s> forsyte refuse and are allowed to refuse to carry out the obligations of the commissions which they have given <\s>
<s> he would now call his client in case he should at the last moment have found himself able to be present <\s>
<s> the name philip baynes bosinney was called three times by the ushers and the sound of the calling echoed with strange melancholy throughout the court and galleries <\s>
<s> the crying of this name to which no answer was returned had upon james a curious effect it was like calling for your lost dog about the streets <\s>
<s> and the creepy feeling that it gave him of a man missing grated on his sense of comfort and security on his cosiness <\s>
<s> though he could not have said why it made him feel uneasy <\s>
<s> he looked now at the clock a quarter to three <\s>
<s> it would be all over in a quarter of an hour <\s>
<s> where could the young fellow be <\s>
<s> it was only when mr <\s>
<s> justice bentham delivered judgment that he got over the turn he had received <\s>
<s> behind the wooden erection by which he was fenced from more ordinary mortals the learned judge leaned forward <\s>
<s> the electric light just turned on above his head fell on his face and mellowed it to an orange hue beneath the snowy crown of his wig the amplitude of his robes grew before the eye his whole figure facing the comparative dusk of the court radiated like some majestic and sacred body <\s>
<s> he cleared his throat took a sip of water broke the nib of a quill against the desk and folding his bony hands before him began <\s>
<s> to james he suddenly loomed much larger than he had ever thought bentham would loom <\s>
<s> it was the majesty of the law and a person endowed with a nature far less matter of fact than that of james might have been excused for failing to pierce this halo and disinter therefrom the somewhat ordinary forsyte who walked and talked in every day life under the name of sir walter bentham <\s>
<s> he delivered judgment in the following words the facts in this case are not in dispute <\s>
<s> on may 15 last the defendant wrote to the plaintiff requesting to be allowed to withdraw from his professional position in regard to the decoration of the plaintiff's house unless he were given a free hand <\s>
<s> the plaintiff on may 17 wrote back as follows in giving you in accordance with your request this free hand i wish you to clearly understand that the total cost of the house as handed over to me completely decorated inclusive of your fee as arranged between us must not exceed twelve thousand pounds <\s>
<s> to this letter the defendant replied on may 18 if you think that in such a delicate matter as decoration i can bind myself to the exact pound i am afraid you are mistaken <\s>
<s> on may 19 the plaintiff wrote as follows i did not mean to say that if you should exceed the sum named in my letter to you by ten or twenty or even fifty pounds there would be any difficulty between us <\s>
<s> you have a free hand in the terms of this correspondence and i hope you will see your way to completing the decorations <\s>
<s> on may 20 the defendant replied thus shortly very well <\s>
<s> in completing these decorations the defendant incurred liabilities and expenses which brought the total cost of this house up to the sum of twelve thousand four hundred pounds all of which expenditure has been defrayed by the plaintiff <\s>
<s> this action has been brought by the plaintiff to recover from the defendant the sum of three hundred and fifty pounds expended by him in excess of a sum of twelve thousand and fifty pounds alleged by the plaintiff to have been fixed by this correspondence as the maximum sum that the defendant had authority to expend <\s>
<s> the question for me to decide is whether or no the defendant is liable to refund to the plaintiff this sum <\s>
<s> in my judgment he is so liable <\s>
<s> what in effect the plaintiff has said is this i give you a free hand to complete these decorations provided that you keep within a total cost to me of twelve thousand pounds <\s>
<s> if you exceed that sum by as much as fifty pounds i will not hold you responsible beyond that point you are no agent of mine and i shall repudiate liability <\s>
<s> it is not quite clear to me whether had the plaintiff in fact repudiated liability under his agent's contracts he would under all the circumstances have been successful in so doing but he has not adopted this course <\s>
<s> he has accepted liability and fallen back upon his rights against the defendant under the terms of the latter's engagement <\s>
<s> in my judgment the plaintiff is entitled to recover this sum from the defendant <\s>
<s> it has been sought on behalf of the defendant to show that no limit of expenditure was fixed or intended to be fixed by this correspondence <\s>
<s> if this were so i can find no reason for the plaintiff's importation into the correspondence of the figures of twelve thousand pounds and subsequently of fifty pounds <\s>
<s> the defendant's contention would render these figures meaningless <\s>
<s> it is manifest to me that by his letter of may 20 he assented to a very clear proposition by the terms of which he must be held to be bound <\s>
<s> for these reasons there will be judgment for the plaintiff for the amount claimed with costs <\s>
<s> james sighed and stooping picked up his umbrella which had fallen with a rattle at the words importation into this correspondence <\s>
<s> untangling his legs he rapidly left the court without waiting for his son he snapped up a hansom cab it was a clear grey afternoon and drove straight to timothy's where he found swithin and to him mrs <\s>
<s> septimus small and aunt hester he recounted the whole proceedings eating two muffins not altogether in the intervals of speech <\s>
<s> soames did very well he ended he's got his head screwed on the right way <\s>
<s> this won't please jolyon <\s>
<s> it's a bad business for that young bosinney he'll go bankrupt i shouldn't wonder and then after a long pause during which he had stared disquietly into the fire he added he wasn't there now why <\s>
<s> there was a sound of footsteps <\s>
<s> the figure of a thick set man with the ruddy brown face of robust health was seen in the back drawing room <\s>
<s> the forefinger of his upraised hand was outlined against the black of his frock coat <\s>
<s> he spoke in a grudging voice <\s>
<s> well james he said i can't i can't stop and turning round he walked out <\s>
<s> james rose from his chair <\s>
<s> i knew there was something wro .... <\s>
<s> he checked himself and was silent staring before him as though he had seen a portent <\s>
<s> chapter vi soames breaks the news in leaving the court soames did not go straight home <\s>
<s> he felt disinclined for the city and drawn by need for sympathy in his triumph he too made his way but slowly and on foot to timothy's in the bayswater road <\s>
<s> his father had just left mrs <\s>
<s> small and aunt hester in possession of the whole story greeted him warmly <\s>
<s> they were sure he was hungry after all that evidence <\s>
<s> smither should toast him some more muffins his dear father had eaten them all <\s>
<s> he must put his legs up on the sofa and he must have a glass of prune brandy too <\s>
<s> it was so strengthening <\s>
<s> swithin was still present having lingered later than his wont for he felt in want of exercise <\s>
<s> on hearing this suggestion he pished <\s>
<s> a pretty pass young men were coming to <\s>
<s> his own liver was out of order and he could not bear the thought of anyone else drinking prune brandy <\s>
<s> he went away almost immediately saying to soames and how's your wife <\s>
<s> you tell her from me that if she's dull and likes to come and dine with me quietly i'll give her such a bottle of champagne as she doesn't get every day <\s>
<s> staring down from his height on soames he contracted his thick puffy yellow hand as though squeezing within it all this small fry and throwing out his chest he waddled slowly away <\s>
<s> small and aunt hester were left horrified <\s>
<s> swithin was so droll <\s>
<s> they themselves were longing to ask soames how irene would take the result yet knew that they must not he would perhaps say something of his own accord to throw some light on this the present burning question in their lives the question that from necessity of silence tortured them almost beyond bearing for even timothy had now been told and the effect on his health was little short of alarming <\s>
<s> and what too would june do <\s>
<s> this also was a most exciting if dangerous speculation <\s>
<s> they had never forgotten old jolyon's visit since when he had not once been to see them they had never forgotten the feeling it gave all who were present that the family was no longer what it had been that the family was breaking up <\s>
<s> but soames gave them no help sitting with his knees crossed talking of the barbizon school of painters whom he had just discovered <\s>
<s> these were the coming men he said he should not wonder if a lot of money were made over them he had his eye on two pictures by a man called corot charming things if he could get them at a reasonable price he was going to buy them they would he thought fetch a big price some day <\s>
<s> interested as they could not but be neither mrs <\s>
<s> septimus small nor aunt hester could entirely acquiesce in being thus put off <\s>
<s> it was interesting most interesting and then soames was so clever that they were sure he would do something with those pictures if anybody could but what was his plan now that he had won his case was he going to leave london at once and live in the country or what was he going to do <\s>
<s> soames answered that he did not know he thought they should be moving soon <\s>
<s> he rose and kissed his aunts <\s>

<s> it was a rich moment <\s>
<s> he sipped and a gentle glow spread in his veins already heated <\s>
<s> with a rapid look round he said i joined the imperial yeomanry to day granny and emptied his glass as though drinking the health of his own act <\s>
<s> it was his mother's desolate little word <\s>
<s> young jolly forsyte and i went down there together <\s>
<s> we go into camp on monday <\s>
<s> all looked at james <\s>
<s> he was leaning forward with his hand behind his ear <\s>
<s> emily reached forward to pat val's hand <\s>
<s> it's only that val has joined the yeomanry james it's very nice for him <\s>
<s> he'll look his best in uniform <\s>
<s> came from james tremulously loud <\s>
<s> you can't see two yards before your nose <\s>
<s> he he'll have to go out there <\s>
<s> he'll be fighting before he knows where he is <\s>
<s> val saw imogen's eyes admiring him and his mother still and fashionable with her handkerchief before her lips <\s>
<s> suddenly his uncle spoke <\s>
<s> i thought of that smiled val i gave my age as twenty one <\s>
<s> he heard his grandmother's admiring well val that was plucky of you was conscious of warmson deferentially filling his champagne glass and of his grandfather's voice moaning i don't know what'll become of you if you go on like this <\s>
<s> imogen was patting his shoulder his uncle looking at him sidelong only his mother sat unmoving till affected by her stillness val said it's all right you know we shall soon have them on the run <\s>
<s> i only hope i shall come in for something <\s>
<s> he felt elated sorry tremendously important all at once <\s>
<s> this would show uncle soames and all the forsytes how to be sportsmen <\s>
<s> he had certainly done something heroic and exceptional in giving his age as twenty one <\s>
<s> emily's voice brought him back to earth <\s>
<s> you mustn't have a second glass james <\s>
<s> won't they be astonished at timothy's <\s>
<s> i'd give anything to see their faces <\s>
<s> do you have a sword val or only a popgun <\s>
<s> his uncle's voice produced a slight chill in the pit of val's stomach <\s>
<s> he was grateful for his grandmother's comfortable well i think it's very plucky of val <\s>
<s> i'm sure he'll make a splendid soldier he's just the figure for it <\s>
<s> we shall all be proud of him <\s>
<s> what had young jolly forsyte to do with it <\s>
<s> why did you go together <\s>
<s> pursued soames uncannily relentless <\s>
<s> i thought you weren't friendly with him <\s>
<s> i'm not mumbled val but i wasn't going to be beaten by him <\s>
<s> he saw his uncle look at him quite differently as if approving <\s>
<s> his grandfather was nodding too his grandmother tossing her head <\s>
<s> they all approved of his not being beaten by that cousin of his <\s>
<s> there must be a reason <\s>
<s> val was dimly conscious of some disturbing point outside his range of vision as it might be the unlocated centre of a cyclone <\s>
<s> and staring at his uncle's face he had a quite unaccountable vision of a woman with dark eyes gold hair and a white neck who smelt nice and had pretty silken clothes which he had liked feeling when he was quite small <\s>
<s> she used to kiss him and he had bitten her arm once playfully because he liked it so soft <\s>
<s> his grandfather was speaking what's his father doing <\s>
<s> he's away in paris val said staring at the very queer expression on his uncle's face like like that of a snarling dog <\s>
<s> the word coming from the very bottom of his soul broke up the dinner <\s>
<s> opposite his mother in the cab going home val tasted the after fruits of heroism like medlars over ripe <\s>
<s> she only said indeed that he must go to his tailor's at once and have his uniform properly made and not just put up with what they gave him <\s>
<s> but he could feel that she was very much upset <\s>
<s> it was on his lips to console her with the spoken thought that he would be out of the way of that beastly divorce but the presence of imogen and the knowledge that his mother would not be out of the way restrained him <\s>
<s> he felt aggrieved that she did not seem more proud of him <\s>
<s> when imogen had gone to bed he risked the emotional <\s>
<s> i'm awfully sorry to have to leave you mother <\s>
<s> well i must make the best of it <\s>
<s> we must try and get you a commission as soon as we can then you won't have to rough it so <\s>
<s> do you know any drill val <\s>
<s> i hope they won't worry you much <\s>
<s> i must take you about to get the things to morrow <\s>
<s> with that kiss soft and hot between his eyes and those words i hope they won't worry you much in his ears he sat down to a cigarette before a dying fire <\s>
<s> the heat was out of him the glow of cutting a dash <\s>
<s> it was all a damned heart aching bore <\s>
<s> i'll be even with that chap jolly he thought trailing up the stairs past the room where his mother was biting her pillow to smother a sense of desolation which was trying to make her sob <\s>
<s> and soon only one of the diners at james was awake soames in his bedroom above his father's <\s>
<s> so that fellow jolyon was in paris what was he doing there <\s>
<s> the last report from polteed had hinted that there might be something soon <\s>
<s> could it be this <\s>
<s> that fellow with his beard and his cursed amused way of speaking son of the old man who had given him the nickname man of property and bought the fatal house from him <\s>
<s> soames had ever resented having had to sell the house at robin hill never forgiven his uncle for having bought it or his cousin for living in it <\s>
<s> reckless of the cold he threw his window up and gazed out across the park <\s>
<s> bleak and dark the january night little sound of traffic a frost coming bare trees a star or two <\s>
<s> i'll see polteed to morrow he thought <\s>
<s> i'm mad i think to want her still <\s>
<s> chapter x death of the dog balthasar jolyon who had crossed from calais by night arrived at robin hill on sunday morning <\s>
<s> he had sent no word beforehand so walked up from the station entering his domain by the coppice gate <\s>
<s> coming to the log seat fashioned out of an old fallen trunk he sat down first laying his overcoat on it <\s>
<s> he thought that's what love ends in at my time of life <\s>
<s> and suddenly irene seemed very near just as she had been that day of rambling at fontainebleau when they had sat on a log to eat their lunch <\s>
<s> odour drawn out of fallen leaves by the pale filtering sunlight soaked his nostrils <\s>
<s> i'm glad it isn't spring he thought <\s>
<s> with the scent of sap and the song of birds and the bursting of the blossoms it would have been unbearable <\s>
<s> i hope i shall be over it by then old fool that i am <\s>
<s> and picking up his coat he walked on into the field <\s>
<s> he passed the pond and mounted the hill slowly <\s>
<s> near the top a hoarse barking greeted him <\s>
<s> up on the lawn above the fernery he could see his old dog balthasar <\s>
<s> the animal whose dim eyes took his master for a stranger was warning the world against him <\s>
<s> jolyon gave his special whistle <\s>
<s> even at that distance of a hundred yards and more he could see the dawning recognition in the obese brown white body <\s>
<s> the old dog got off his haunches and his tail close curled over his back began a feeble excited fluttering he came waddling forward gathered momentum and disappeared over the edge of the fernery <\s>
<s> jolyon expected to meet him at the wicket gate but balthasar was not there and rather alarmed he turned into the fernery <\s>
<s> on his fat side looking up with eyes already glazing the old dog lay <\s>
<s> what is it my poor old man <\s>
<s> balthasar's curled and fluffy tail just moved his filming eyes seemed saying i can't get up master but i'm glad to see you <\s>
<s> jolyon knelt down his eyes very dimmed could hardly see the slowly ceasing heave of the dog's side <\s>

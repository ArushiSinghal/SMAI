<s> let's have orfeo round about him now were fields of gold and silver flowers white forms swaying in the sunlight bright birds flying to and fro <\s>
<s> lingering waves of sweetness and regret flooded his soul <\s>
<s> some cigar ash dropped and taking out a silk handkerchief to brush it off he inhaled a mingled scent as of snuff and eau de cologne <\s>
<s> he thought indian summer that's all <\s>
<s> and he said you haven't played me che faro she did not answer did not move <\s>
<s> he was conscious of something some strange upset <\s>
<s> suddenly he saw her rise and turn away and a pang of remorse shot through him <\s>
<s> what a clumsy chap <\s>
<s> like orpheus she of course she too was looking for her lost one in the hall of memory <\s>
<s> and disturbed to the heart he got up from his chair <\s>
<s> she had gone to the great window at the far end <\s>
<s> her hands were folded over her breast he could just see her cheek very white <\s>
<s> and quite emotionalized he said there there my love <\s>
<s> the words had escaped him mechanically for they were those he used to holly when she had a pain but their effect was instantaneously distressing <\s>
<s> she raised her arms covered her face with them and wept <\s>
<s> old jolyon stood gazing at her with eyes very deep from age <\s>
<s> the passionate shame she seemed feeling at her abandonment so unlike the control and quietude of her whole presence was as if she had never before broken down in the presence of another being <\s>
<s> he murmured and putting his hand out reverently touched her <\s>
<s> she turned and leaned the arms which covered her face against him <\s>
<s> old jolyon stood very still keeping one thin hand on her shoulder <\s>
<s> let her cry her heart out it would do her good <\s>
<s> and the dog balthasar puzzled sat down on his stern to examine them <\s>
<s> the window was still open the curtains had not been drawn the last of daylight from without mingled with faint intrusion from the lamp within there was a scent of new mown grass <\s>
<s> with the wisdom of a long life old jolyon did not speak <\s>
<s> even grief sobbed itself out in time only time was good for sorrow time who saw the passing of each mood each emotion in turn time the layer to rest <\s>
<s> there came into his mind the words as panteth the hart after cooling streams' but they were of no use to him <\s>
<s> then conscious of a scent of violets he knew she was drying her eyes <\s>
<s> he put his chin forward pressed his moustache against her forehead and felt her shake with a quivering of her whole body as of a tree which shakes itself free of raindrops <\s>
<s> she put his hand to her lips as if saying all over now <\s>
<s> the kiss filled him with a strange comfort he led her back to where she had been so upset <\s>
<s> and the dog balthasar following laid the bone of one of the cutlets they had eaten at their feet <\s>
<s> anxious to obliterate the memory of that emotion he could think of nothing better than china and moving with her slowly from cabinet to cabinet he kept taking up bits of dresden and lowestoft and chelsea turning them round and round with his thin veined hands whose skin faintly freckled had such an aged look <\s>
<s> i bought this at jobson's he would say cost me thirty pounds <\s>
<s> that dog leaves his bones all over the place <\s>
<s> this old ship bowl i picked up at the sale when that precious rip the marquis came to grief <\s>
<s> but you don't remember <\s>
<s> here's a nice piece of chelsea <\s>
<s> now what would you say this was <\s>
<s> and he was comforted feeling that with her taste she was taking a real interest in these things for after all nothing better composes the nerves than a doubtful piece of china <\s>
<s> when the crunch of the carriage wheels was heard at last he said you must come again you must come to lunch then i can show you these by daylight and my little sweet she's a dear little thing <\s>
<s> this dog seems to have taken a fancy to you <\s>

<s> there was of course a better world <\s>
<s> in my father's house are many mansions was one of aunt juley's favourite sayings it always comforted her with its suggestion of house property which had made the fortune of dear roger <\s>
<s> the bible was indeed a great resource and on very fine sundays there was church in the morning and sometimes juley would steal into timothy's study when she was sure he was out and just put an open new testament casually among the books on his little table he was a great reader of course having been a publisher <\s>
<s> but she had noticed that timothy was always cross at dinner afterwards <\s>
<s> and smither had told her more than once that she had picked books off the floor in doing the room <\s>
<s> still with all that they did feel that heaven could not be quite so cosy as the rooms in which they and timothy had been waiting so long <\s>
<s> aunt hester especially could not bear the thought of the exertion <\s>
<s> any change or rather the thought of a change for there never was any always upset her very much <\s>
<s> aunt juley who had more spirit sometimes thought it would be quite exciting she had so enjoyed that visit to brighton the year dear susan died <\s>
<s> but then brighton one knew was nice and it was so difficult to tell what heaven would be like so on the whole she was more than content to wait <\s>
<s> on the morning of james birthday august the 5th they felt extraordinary animation and little notes passed between them by the hand of smither while they were having breakfast in their beds <\s>
<s> smither must go round and take their love and little presents and find out how mr <\s>
<s> james was and whether he had passed a good night with all the excitement <\s>
<s> and on the way back would smither call in at green street it was a little out of her way but she could take the bus up bond street afterwards it would be a nice little change for her and ask dear mrs <\s>
<s> dartie to be sure and look in before she went out of town <\s>
<s> all this smither did an undeniable servant trained many years ago under aunt ann to a perfection not now procurable <\s>
<s> james said had passed an excellent night he sent his love mrs <\s>
<s> james had said he was very funny and had complained that he didn't know what all the fuss was about <\s>
<s> dartie sent her love and she would come to tea <\s>
<s> aunts juley and hester rather hurt that their presents had not received special mention they forgot every year that james could not bear to receive presents throwing away their money on him as he always called it were delighted it showed that james was in good spirits and that was so important for him <\s>
<s> and they began to wait for winifred <\s>
<s> she came at four bringing imogen and maud just back from school and getting such a pretty girl too so that it was extremely difficult to ask for news about annette <\s>
<s> aunt juley however summoned courage to enquire whether winifred had heard anything and if soames was anxious <\s>
<s> uncle soames is always anxious auntie interrupted imogen he can't be happy now he's got it <\s>
<s> the words struck familiarly on aunt juley's ears <\s>
<s> yes that funny drawing of george's which had not been shown them <\s>
<s> but what did imogen mean <\s>
<s> that her uncle always wanted more than he could have <\s>
<s> it was not at all nice to think like that <\s>
<s> imogen's voice rose clear and clipped imagine <\s>
<s> annette's only two years older than me it must be awful for her married to uncle soames <\s>
<s> aunt juley lifted her hands in horror <\s>
<s> my dear she said you don't know what you're talking about <\s>
<s> your uncle soames is a match for anybody <\s>
<s> he's a very clever man and good looking and wealthy and most considerate and careful and not at all old considering everything <\s>
<s> imogen turning her luscious glance from one to the other of the old dears only smiled <\s>
<s> i hope said aunt juley quite severely that you will marry as good a man <\s>
<s> i shan't marry a good man auntie murmured imogen they're dull <\s>
<s> if you go on like this replied aunt juley still very much upset you won't marry anybody <\s>
<s> we'd better not pursue the subject and turning to winifred she said how is montague <\s>
<s> that evening while they were waiting for dinner she murmured i've told smither to get up half a bottle of the sweet champagne hester <\s>
<s> i think we ought to drink dear james health and and the health of soames wife only let's keep that quite secret <\s>
<s> i'll just say like this and you know hester <\s>
<s> and then we'll drink <\s>
<s> it might upset timothy <\s>
<s> it's more likely to upset us said aunt nester <\s>
<s> but we must i suppose for such an occasion <\s>
<s> yes said aunt juley rapturously it is an occasion <\s>
<s> only fancy if he has a dear little boy to carry the family on <\s>
<s> i do feel it so important now that irene has had a son <\s>
<s> winifred says george is calling jolyon the three decker because of his three families you know <\s>
<s> irene is living after all in the house soames had built for them both <\s>
<s> it does seem hard on dear soames and he's always been so regular <\s>
<s> that night in bed excited and a little flushed still by her glass of wine and the secrecy of the second toast she lay with her prayer book opened flat and her eyes fixed on a ceiling yellowed by the light from her reading lamp <\s>
<s> it was so nice for them all <\s>
<s> and she would be so happy if she could see dear soames happy <\s>
<s> but of course he must be now in spite of what imogen had said <\s>
<s> he would have all that he wanted property and wife and children <\s>

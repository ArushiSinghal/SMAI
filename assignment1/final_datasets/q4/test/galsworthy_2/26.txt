<s> soames forsyte the shelter connoisseurs club mapledurham <\s>
<s> but here the forsyte saga must digress again .... <\s>
<s> to return from a long travel in spain to a darkened house to a little daughter bewildered with tears to the sight of a loved father lying peaceful in his last sleep had never been was never likely to be forgotten by so impressionable and warm hearted a man as jolyon <\s>
<s> a sense as of mystery too clung to that sad day and about the end of one whose life had been so well ordered balanced and above board <\s>
<s> it seemed incredible that his father could thus have vanished without as it were announcing his intention without last words to his son and due farewells <\s>
<s> and those incoherent allusions of little holly to the lady in grey of mademoiselle beauce to a madame errant as it sounded involved all things in a mist lifted a little when he read his father's will and the codicil thereto <\s>
<s> it had been his duty as executor of that will and codicil to inform irene wife of his cousin soames of her life interest in fifteen thousand pounds <\s>
<s> he had called on her to explain that the existing investment in india stock ear marked to meet the charge would produce for her the interesting net sum of l430 odd a year clear of income tax <\s>
<s> this was but the third time he had seen his cousin soames wife if indeed she was still his wife of which he was not quite sure <\s>
<s> he remembered having seen her sitting in the botanical gardens waiting for bosinney a passive fascinating figure reminding him of titian's heavenly love and again when charged by his father he had gone to montpellier square on the afternoon when bosinney's death was known <\s>
<s> he still recalled vividly her sudden appearance in the drawing room doorway on that occasion her beautiful face passing from wild eagerness of hope to stony despair remembered the compassion he had felt soames snarling smile his words we are not at home <\s>
<s> and the slam of the front door <\s>
<s> this third time he saw a face and form more beautiful freed from that warp of wild hope and despair <\s>
<s> looking at her he thought yes you are just what the dad would have admired <\s>
<s> and the strange story of his father's indian summer became slowly clear to him <\s>
<s> she spoke of old jolyon with reverence and tears in her eyes <\s>
<s> he was so wonderfully kind to me i don't know why <\s>
<s> he looked so beautiful and peaceful sitting in that chair under the tree it was i who first came on him sitting there you know <\s>
<s> such a lovely day <\s>
<s> i don't think an end could have been happier <\s>
<s> we should all like to go out like that <\s>
<s> we should all a like to go out in full summer with beauty stepping towards us across a lawn <\s>
<s> and looking round the little almost empty drawing room he had asked her what she was going to do now <\s>
<s> i am going to live again a little cousin jolyon <\s>
<s> it's wonderful to have money of one's own <\s>
<s> i've never had any <\s>
<s> i shall keep this flat i think i'm used to it but i shall be able to go to italy <\s>
<s> jolyon had murmured looking at her faintly smiling lips and he had gone away thinking a fascinating woman <\s>
<s> i'm glad the dad left her that money <\s>
<s> he had not seen her again but every quarter he had signed her cheque forwarding it to her bank with a note to the chelsea flat to say that he had done so and always he had received a note in acknowledgment generally from the flat but sometimes from italy so that her personality had become embodied in slightly scented grey paper an upright fine handwriting and the words dear cousin jolyon <\s>
<s> man of property that he now was the slender cheque he signed often gave rise to the thought well i suppose she just manages sliding into a vague wonder how she was faring otherwise in a world of men not wont to let beauty go unpossessed <\s>
<s> at first holly had spoken of her sometimes but ladies in grey soon fade from children's memories and the tightening of june's lips in those first weeks after her grandfather's death whenever her former friend's name was mentioned had discouraged allusion <\s>
<s> only once indeed had june spoken definitely i've forgiven her <\s>
<s> i'm frightfully glad she's independent now .... <\s>
<s> on receiving soames card jolyon said to the maid for he could not abide butlers show him into the study please and say i'll be there in a minute and then he looked at holly and asked do you remember the lady in grey who used to give you music lessons <\s>
<s> jolyon shook his head and changing his holland blouse for a coat was silent perceiving suddenly that such history was not for those young ears <\s>
<s> his face in fact became whimsical perplexity incarnate while he journeyed towards the study <\s>
<s> standing by the french window looking out across the terrace at the oak tree were two figures middle aged and young and he thought who's that boy <\s>
<s> surely they never had a child <\s>
<s> the elder figure turned <\s>
<s> the meeting of those two forsytes of the second generation so much more sophisticated than the first in the house built for the one and owned and occupied by the other was marked by subtle defensiveness beneath distinct attempt at cordiality <\s>
<s> has he come about his wife <\s>
<s> jolyon was thinking and soames how shall i begin <\s>
<s> while val brought to break the ice stood negligently scrutinising this bearded pard from under his dark thick eyelashes <\s>
<s> this is val dartie said soames my sister's son <\s>
<s> he's just going up to oxford <\s>
<s> i thought i'd like him to know your boy <\s>
<s> i'm sorry jolly's away <\s>
<s> b n c replied val <\s>
<s> jolly's at the house but he'll be delighted to look you up <\s>
<s> holly's in if you could put up with a female relation she'd show you round <\s>
<s> you'll find her in the hall if you go through the curtains <\s>
<s> i was just painting her <\s>
<s> with another thanks awfully <\s>
<s> val vanished leaving the two cousins with the ice unbroken <\s>
<s> i see you've some drawings at the water colours said soames <\s>
<s> he had been out of touch with the forsyte family at large for twenty six years but they were connected in his mind with frith's derby day and landseer prints <\s>
<s> he had heard from june that soames was a connoisseur which made it worse <\s>
<s> he had become aware too of a curious sensation of repugnance <\s>
<s> i haven't seen you for a long time he said <\s>
<s> no answered soames between close lips not since as a matter of fact it's about that i've come <\s>
<s> you're her trustee i'm told <\s>
<s> twelve years is a long time said soames rapidly i i'm tired of it <\s>
<s> jolyon found no more appropriate answer than won't you smoke <\s>
<s> jolyon himself lit a cigarette <\s>
<s> i wish to be free said soames abruptly <\s>
<s> i don't see her murmured jolyon through the fume of his cigarette <\s>
<s> but you know where she lives i suppose <\s>
<s> he did not mean to give her address without permission <\s>
<s> soames seemed to divine his thought <\s>
<s> i don't want her address he said i know it <\s>
<s> what exactly do you want <\s>
<s> i want a divorce <\s>
<s> rather late in the day isn't it <\s>
<s> and there was a silence <\s>
<s> i don't know much about these things at least i've forgotten said jolyon with a wry smile <\s>
<s> he himself had had to wait for death to grant him a divorce from the first mrs <\s>
<s> do you wish me to see her about it <\s>
<s> soames raised his eyes to his cousin's face <\s>
<s> i suppose there's someone he said <\s>
<s> a shrug moved jolyon's shoulders <\s>
<s> i don't know at all <\s>
<s> i imagine you may have both lived as if the other were dead <\s>
<s> it's usual in these cases <\s>
<s> soames turned to the window <\s>
<s> a few early fallen oak leaves strewed the terrace already and were rolling round in the wind <\s>
<s> jolyon saw the figures of holly and val dartie moving across the lawn towards the stables <\s>
<s> i'm not going to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds he thought <\s>
<s> i must act for her <\s>
<s> the dad would have wished that <\s>
<s> and for a swift moment he seemed to see his father's figure in the old armchair just beyond soames sitting with knees crossed the times in his hand <\s>
<s> my father was fond of her he said quietly <\s>
<s> why he should have been i don't know soames answered without looking round <\s>
<s> she brought trouble to your daughter june she brought trouble to everyone <\s>
<s> i gave her all she wanted <\s>
<s> i would have given her even forgiveness but she chose to leave me <\s>
<s> in jolyon compassion was checked by the tone of that close voice <\s>
<s> what was there in the fellow that made it so difficult to be sorry for him <\s>
<s> i can go and see her if you like he said <\s>
<s> i suppose she might be glad of a divorce but i know nothing <\s>

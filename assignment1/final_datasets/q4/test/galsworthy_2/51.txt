<s> there are various kinds of shocks to the vertebrae to the nerves to moral sensibility and more potent and permanent to personal dignity <\s>
<s> this last was the shock jon received coming thus on his mother <\s>
<s> soames forsyde is a bit old fashioned <\s>
<s> i want to see him have a pleasure some day <\s>
<s> don't you worry he's not so miserable as he looks <\s>
<s> he'll never show he's enjoying anything they might try and take it from him <\s>
<s> once bit twice shy <\s>
<s> well jon said val hastily if you've finished we'll go and have coffee <\s>
<s> jon asked on the stairs <\s>
<s> i didn't quite old george forsyte is a first cousin of your father's and of my uncle soames <\s>
<s> he's always been here <\s>
<s> the other chap profond is a queer fish <\s>
<s> i think he's hanging round soames wife if you ask me <\s>
<s> jon looked at him startled <\s>
<s> but that's awful he said i mean for fleur <\s>
<s> don't suppose fleur cares very much she's very up to date <\s>
<s> you're very green jon <\s>
<s> mothers he stammered angrily are different <\s>
<s> you're right said val suddenly but things aren't what they were when i was your age <\s>
<s> there's a to morrow we die feeling <\s>
<s> that's what old george meant about my uncle soames <\s>
<s> he doesn't mean to die to morrow <\s>
<s> jon said quickly what's the matter between him and my father <\s>
<s> take my advice and bottle up <\s>
<s> you'll do no good by knowing <\s>
<s> jon shook his head <\s>
<s> i hate the way people keep things from one he muttered and then sneer at one for being green <\s>
<s> well you can ask holly <\s>
<s> if she won't tell you you'll believe it's for your own good i suppose <\s>
<s> i must go now thanks awfully for the lunch <\s>
<s> val smiled up at him half sorry and yet amused <\s>
<s> the boy looked so upset <\s>
<s> see you on friday <\s>
<s> i don't know murmured jon <\s>
<s> and he did not <\s>
<s> this conspiracy of silence made him desperate <\s>
<s> it was humiliating to be treated like a child <\s>
<s> he retraced his moody steps to stratton street <\s>
<s> but he would go to her club now and find out the worst <\s>
<s> to his enquiry the reply was that miss forsyte was not in the club <\s>
<s> she might be in perhaps later <\s>
<s> she was often in on monday they could not say <\s>
<s> jon said he would call again and crossing into the green park flung himself down under a tree <\s>
<s> the sun was bright and a breeze fluttered the leaves of the young lime tree beneath which he lay but his heart ached <\s>
<s> such darkness seemed gathered round his happiness <\s>
<s> he heard big ben chime three above the traffic <\s>
<s> the sound moved something in him and taking out a piece of paper he began to scribble on it with a pencil <\s>
<s> he had jotted a stanza and was searching the grass for another verse when something hard touched his shoulder a green parasol <\s>
<s> there above him stood fleur <\s>
<s> they told me you'd been and were coming back <\s>
<s> so i thought you might be out here and you are it's rather wonderful <\s>
<s> i thought you'd have forgotten me <\s>
<s> when i told you that i shouldn't <\s>
<s> jon seized her arm <\s>
<s> it's too much luck <\s>
<s> let's get away from this side <\s>
<s> he almost dragged her on through that too thoughtfully regulated park to find some cover where they could sit and hold each other's hands <\s>
<s> hasn't anybody cut in <\s>
<s> he said gazing round at her lashes in suspense above her cheeks <\s>
<s> there is a young idiot but he doesn't count <\s>
<s> jon felt a twitch of compassion for the young idiot <\s>
<s> you know i've had sunstroke i didn't tell you <\s>
<s> mother was an angel <\s>
<s> has anything happened to you <\s>
<s> except that i think i've found out what's wrong between our families jon <\s>
<s> his heart began beating very fast <\s>
<s> i believe my father wanted to marry your mother and your father got her instead <\s>
<s> i came on a photo of her it was in a frame behind a photo of me <\s>
<s> of course if he was very fond of her that would have made him pretty mad wouldn't it <\s>
<s> jon thought for a minute <\s>
<s> not if she loved my father best <\s>
<s> but suppose they were engaged <\s>
<s> if we were engaged and you found you loved somebody better i might go cracked but i shouldn't grudge it you <\s>
<s> you mustn't ever do that with me jon <\s>
<s> i don't believe that he's ever really cared for my mother <\s>
<s> val's words the two past masters in the club <\s>
<s> you see we don't know went on fleur it may have been a great shock <\s>
<s> she may have behaved badly to him <\s>
<s> fleur shrugged her shoulders <\s>
<s> i don't think we know much about our fathers and mothers <\s>
<s> we just see them in the light of the way they treat us but they've treated other people you know before we were born plenty i expect <\s>
<s> you see they're both old <\s>
<s> look at your father with three separate families <\s>
<s> isn't there any place cried jon in all this beastly london where we can be alone <\s>
<s> let's get one then <\s>
<s> when they were installed fleur asked suddenly are you going back to robin hill <\s>
<s> i should like to see where you live jon <\s>
<s> i'm staying with my aunt for the night but i could get back in time for dinner <\s>
<s> i wouldn't come to the house of course <\s>
<s> jon gazed at her enraptured <\s>
<s> i can show it you from the copse we shan't meet anybody <\s>
<s> there's a train at four <\s>
<s> the god of property and his forsytes great and small leisured official commercial or professional like the working classes still worked their seven hours a day so that those two of the fourth generation travelled down to robin hill in an empty first class carriage dusty and sun warmed of that too early train <\s>
<s> they travelled in blissful silence holding each other's hands <\s>
<s> at the station they saw no one except porters and a villager or two unknown to jon and walked out up the lane which smelled of dust and honeysuckle <\s>
<s> for jon sure of her now and without separation before him it was a miraculous dawdle more wonderful than those on the downs or along the river thames <\s>
<s> it was love in a mist one of those illumined pages of life where every word and smile and every light touch they gave each other were as little gold and red and blue butterflies and flowers and birds scrolled in among the text a happy communing without afterthought which lasted thirty seven minutes <\s>

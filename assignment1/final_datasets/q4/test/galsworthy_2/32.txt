<s> winifred who had adopted a kind of half mourning which became her fair hair and tall figure very well arrived in james barouche drawn by james pair <\s>
<s> soames had not seen it in the city since his father retired from business five years ago and its incongruity gave him a shock <\s>
<s> times are changing he thought one doesn't know what'll go next <\s>
<s> top hats even were scarcer <\s>
<s> he enquired after val <\s>
<s> val said winifred wrote that he was going to play polo next term <\s>
<s> she thought he was in a very good set <\s>
<s> she added with fashionably disguised anxiety will there be much publicity about my affair soames <\s>
<s> must it be in the papers <\s>
<s> it's so bad for him and the girls <\s>
<s> with his own calamity all raw within him soames answered the papers are a pushing lot it's very difficult to keep things out <\s>
<s> they pretend to be guarding the public's morals and they corrupt them with their beastly reports <\s>
<s> but we haven't got to that yet <\s>
<s> we're only seeing dreamer to day on the restitution question <\s>
<s> of course he understands that it's to lead to a divorce but you must seem genuinely anxious to get dartie back you might practice that attitude to day <\s>
<s> what a clown monty's been <\s>
<s> soames gave her a sharp look <\s>
<s> it was clear to him that she could not take her dartie seriously and would go back on the whole thing if given half a chance <\s>
<s> his own instinct had been firm in this matter from the first <\s>
<s> to save a little scandal now would only bring on his sister and her children real disgrace and perhaps ruin later on if dartie were allowed to hang on to them going down hill and spending the money james would leave his daughter <\s>
<s> though it was all tied up that fellow would milk the settlements somehow and make his family pay through the nose to keep him out of bankruptcy or even perhaps gaol <\s>
<s> they left the shining carriage with the shining horses and the shining hatted servants on the embankment and walked up to dreamer q c s chambers in crown office row <\s>
<s> bellby is here sir said the clerk mr <\s>
<s> dreamer will be ten minutes <\s>
<s> bellby the junior not as junior as he might have been for soames only employed barristers of established reputation it was indeed something of a mystery to him how barristers ever managed to establish that which made him employ them mr <\s>
<s> bellby was seated taking a final glance through his papers <\s>
<s> he had come from court and was in wig and gown which suited a nose jutting out like the handle of a tiny pump his small shrewd blue eyes and rather protruding lower lip no better man to supplement and stiffen dreamer <\s>
<s> the introduction to winifred accomplished they leaped the weather and spoke of the war <\s>
<s> soames interrupted suddenly if he doesn't comply we can't bring proceedings for six months <\s>
<s> i want to get on with the matter bellby <\s>
<s> bellby who had the ghost of an irish brogue smiled at winifred and murmured the law's delays mrs <\s>
<s> repeated soames it'll drive it up to june <\s>
<s> we shan't get the suit on till after the long vacation <\s>
<s> we must put the screw on bellby he would have all his work cut out to keep winifred up to the scratch <\s>
<s> dreamer will see you now sir <\s>
<s> they filed in mr <\s>
<s> bellby going first and soames escorting winifred after an interval of one minute by his watch <\s>
<s> dreamer q c in a gown but divested of wig was standing before the fire as if this conference were in the nature of a treat he had the leathery rather oily complexion which goes with great learning a considerable nose with glasses perched on it and little greyish whiskers he luxuriated in the perpetual cocking of one eye and the concealment of his lower with his upper lip which gave a smothered turn to his speech <\s>
<s> he had a way too of coming suddenly round the corner on the person he was talking to this with a disconcerting tone of voice and a habit of growling before he began to speak had secured a reputation second in probate and divorce to very few <\s>
<s> having listened eye cocked to mr <\s>
<s> bellby's breezy recapitulation of the facts he growled and said i know all that and coming round the corner at winifred smothered the words we want to get him back don't we mrs <\s>
<s> soames interposed sharply my sister's position of course is intolerable <\s>
<s> now can we rely on the cabled refusal or must we wait till after christmas to give him a chance to have written that's the point isn't it <\s>
<s> what do you say bellby <\s>
<s> said dreamer coming round his corner <\s>
<s> bellby seemed to sniff the air like a hound <\s>
<s> we won't be on till the middle of december <\s>
<s> we've no need to give um more rope than that <\s>
<s> no said soames why should my sister be incommoded by his choosing to go ... <\s>
<s> said dreamer again coming round his corner quite so <\s>
<s> people oughtn't to go to jericho ought they mrs <\s>
<s> and he raised his gown into a sort of fantail <\s>
<s> we can go forward <\s>
<s> is there anything more <\s>
<s> nothing at present said soames meaningly i wanted you to see my sister <\s>
<s> dreamer growled softly delighted <\s>
<s> and let fall the protection of his gown <\s>
<s> winifred went down the stairs <\s>
<s> in spite of himself he was impressed by dreamer <\s>
<s> the evidence is all right i think he said to bellby <\s>
<s> between ourselves if we don't get the thing through quick we never may <\s>
<s> d'you think he understands that <\s>
<s> i'll make um said bellby <\s>
<s> good man though good man <\s>
<s> soames nodded and hastened after his sister <\s>
<s> he found her in a draught biting her lips behind her veil and at once said the evidence of the stewardess will be very complete <\s>
<s> winifred's face hardened she drew herself up and they walked to the carriage <\s>
<s> and all through that silent drive back to green street the souls of both of them revolved a single thought why oh <\s>
<s> why should i have to expose my misfortune to the public like this <\s>
<s> why have to employ spies to peer into my private troubles <\s>
<s> they were not of my making <\s>
<s> chapter v jolly sits in judgment the possessive instinct which so determinedly balked was animating two members of the forsyte family towards riddance of what they could no longer possess was hardening daily in the british body politic <\s>
<s> nicholas originally so doubtful concerning a war which must affect property had been heard to say that these boers were a pig headed lot they were causing a lot of expense and the sooner they had their lesson the better <\s>
<s> he would send out wolseley <\s>
<s> seeing always a little further than other people whence the most considerable fortune of all the forsytes he had perceived already that buller was not the man 'a bull of a chap who just went butting and if they didn't look out ladysmith would fall <\s>
<s> this was early in december so that when black week came he was enabled to say to everybody i told you so <\s>
<s> during that week of gloom such as no forsyte could remember very young nicholas attended so many drills in his corps the devil's own that young nicholas consulted the family physician about his son's health and was alarmed to find that he was perfectly sound <\s>
<s> the boy had only just eaten his dinners and been called to the bar at some expense and it was in a way a nightmare to his father and mother that he should be playing with military efficiency at a time when military efficiency in the civilian population might conceivably be wanted <\s>
<s> his grandfather of course pooh poohed the notion too thoroughly educated in the feeling that no british war could be other than little and professional and profoundly distrustful of imperial commitments by which moreover he stood to lose for he owned de beers now going down fast more than a sufficient sacrifice on the part of his grandson <\s>
<s> at oxford however rather different sentiments prevailed <\s>
<s> the inherent effervescence of conglomerate youth had during the two months of the term before black week been gradually crystallising out into vivid oppositions <\s>
<s> normal adolescence ever in england of a conservative tendency though not taking things too seriously was vehement for a fight to a finish and a good licking for the boers <\s>
<s> of this larger faction val dartie was naturally a member <\s>
<s> radical youth on the other hand a small but perhaps more vocal body was for stopping the war and giving the boers autonomy <\s>
<s> until black week however the groups were amorphous without sharp edges and argument remained but academic <\s>
<s> jolly was one of those who knew not where he stood <\s>
<s> a streak of his grandfather old jolyon's love of justice prevented him from seeing one side only <\s>
<s> moreover in his set of the best there was a jumping jesus of extremely advanced opinions and some personal magnetism <\s>
<s> his father too seemed doubtful in his views <\s>
<s> and though as was proper at the age of twenty he kept a sharp eye on his father watchful for defects which might still be remedied still that father had an air which gave a sort of glamour to his creed of ironic tolerance <\s>
<s> artists of course were notoriously hamlet like and to this extent one must discount for one's father even if one loved him <\s>

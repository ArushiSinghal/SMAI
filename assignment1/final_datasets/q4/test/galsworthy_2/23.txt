<s> this tutor was a year older than himself a good looking youth with fine brown eyes and smooth dark hair a small mouth an oval face languid immaculate cool to a degree one of those young men who without effort establish moral ascendancy over their companions <\s>

<s> surely he had too wide a mouth not the best cut of waistcoat no braid on his trousers and his lavender gloves had no thin black stitchings down the back <\s>
<s> besides he laughed too much crum never laughed he only smiled with his regular dark brows raised a little so that they formed a gable over his just drooped lids <\s>

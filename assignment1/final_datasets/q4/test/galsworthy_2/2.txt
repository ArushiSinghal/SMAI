<s> they had all done so well for themselves these forsytes that they were all what is called of a certain position <\s>
<s> they had shares in all sorts of things not as yet with the exception of timothy in consols for they had no dread in life like that of 3 per cent <\s>
<s> they collected pictures too and were supporters of such charitable institutions as might be beneficial to their sick domestics <\s>
<s> from their father the builder they inherited a talent for bricks and mortar <\s>
<s> originally perhaps members of some primitive sect they were now in the natural course of things members of the church of england and caused their wives and children to attend with some regularity the more fashionable churches of the metropolis <\s>
<s> to have doubted their christianity would have caused them both pain and surprise <\s>
<s> some of them paid for pews thus expressing in the most practical form their sympathy with the teachings of christ <\s>
<s> their residences placed at stated intervals round the park watched like sentinels lest the fair heart of this london where their desires were fixed should slip from their clutches and leave them lower in their own estimations <\s>
<s> there was old jolyon in stanhope place the jameses in park lane swithin in the lonely glory of orange and blue chambers in hyde park mansions he had never married not he the soamses in their nest off knightsbridge the rogers in prince's gardens roger was that remarkable forsyte who had conceived and carried out the notion of bringing up his four sons to a new profession <\s>
<s> collect house property nothing like it he would say i never did anything else <\s>
<s> hayman was the one married forsyte sister in a house high up on campden hill shaped like a giraffe and so tall that it gave the observer a crick in the neck the nicholases in ladbroke grove a spacious abode and a great bargain and last but not least timothy's on the bayswater road where ann and juley and hester lived under his protection <\s>
<s> but all this time james was musing and now he inquired of his host and brother what he had given for that house in montpellier square <\s>
<s> he himself had had his eye on a house there for the last two years but they wanted such a price <\s>
<s> old jolyon recounted the details of his purchase <\s>
<s> twenty two years to run <\s>
<s> repeated james the very house i was after you've given too much for it <\s>
<s> it's not that i want it said james hastily it wouldn't suit my purpose at that price <\s>
<s> soames knows the house well he'll tell you it's too dear his opinion's worth having <\s>
<s> i don't said old jolyon care a fig for his opinion <\s>
<s> well murmured james you will have your own way it's a good opinion <\s>
<s> we're going to drive down to hurlingham <\s>
<s> they tell me june's going to wales <\s>
<s> you'll be lonely tomorrow <\s>
<s> what'll you do with yourself <\s>
<s> you'd better come and dine with us <\s>
<s> he went down to the front door and saw them into their barouche and twinkled at them having already forgotten his spleen mrs <\s>
<s> james facing the horses tall and majestic with auburn hair on her left irene the two husbands father and son sitting forward as though they expected something opposite their wives <\s>
<s> bobbing and bounding upon the spring cushions silent swaying to each motion of their chariot old jolyon watched them drive away under the sunlight <\s>
<s> during the drive the silence was broken by mrs <\s>
<s> did you ever see such a collection of rumty too people <\s>
<s> soames glancing at her beneath his eyelids nodded and he saw irene steal at him one of her unfathomable looks <\s>
<s> it is likely enough that each branch of the forsyte family made that remark as they drove away from old jolyon's at home <\s>
<s> amongst the last of the departing guests the fourth and fifth brothers nicholas and roger walked away together directing their steps alongside hyde park towards the praed street station of the underground <\s>
<s> like all other forsytes of a certain age they kept carriages of their own and never took cabs if by any means they could avoid it <\s>
<s> the day was bright the trees of the park in the full beauty of mid june foliage the brothers did not seem to notice phenomena which contributed nevertheless to the jauntiness of promenade and conversation <\s>
<s> yes said roger she's a good lookin woman that wife of soames's <\s>
<s> i'm told they don't get on <\s>
<s> this brother had a high forehead and the freshest colour of any of the forsytes his light grey eyes measured the street frontage of the houses by the way and now and then he would level his umbrella and take a lunar as he expressed it of the varying heights <\s>
<s> she'd no money replied nicholas <\s>
<s> he himself had married a good deal of money of which it being then the golden age before the married women's property act he had mercifully been enabled to make a successful use <\s>
<s> what was her father <\s>
<s> heron was his name a professor so they tell me <\s>
<s> roger shook his head <\s>
<s> there's no money in that he said <\s>
<s> they say her mother's father was cement <\s>
<s> but he went bankrupt went on nicholas <\s>
<s> exclaimed roger soames will have trouble with her you mark my words he'll have trouble she's got a foreign look <\s>
<s> nicholas licked his lips <\s>
<s> she's a pretty woman and he waved aside a crossing sweeper <\s>
<s> how did he get hold of her <\s>
<s> she must cost him a pretty penny in dress <\s>
<s> ann tells me replied nicholas he was half cracked about her <\s>
<s> she refused him five times <\s>
<s> james he's nervous about it i can see <\s>
<s> said roger again i'm sorry for james he had trouble with dartie <\s>
<s> his pleasant colour was heightened by exercise he swung his umbrella to the level of his eye more frequently than ever <\s>
<s> nicholas's face also wore a pleasant look <\s>
<s> too pale for me he said but her figures capital <\s>
<s> roger made no reply <\s>
<s> i call her distinguished looking he said at last it was the highest praise in the forsyte vocabulary <\s>
<s> that young bosinney will never do any good for himself <\s>
<s> they say at burkitt's he's one of these artistic chaps got an idea of improving english architecture there's no money in that <\s>
<s> i should like to hear what timothy would say to it <\s>
<s> they entered the station <\s>
<s> what class are you going <\s>
<s> no second for me said nicholas you never know what you may catch <\s>
<s> he took a first class ticket to notting hill gate roger a second to south kensington <\s>
<s> the train coming in a minute later the two brothers parted and entered their respective compartments <\s>
<s> each felt aggrieved that the other had not modified his habits to secure his society a little longer but as roger voiced it in his thoughts always a stubborn beggar nick <\s>
<s> and as nicholas expressed it to himself cantankerous chap roger always was <\s>
<s> there was little sentimentality about the forsytes <\s>
<s> in that great london which they had conquered and become merged in what time had they to be sentimental <\s>
<s> chapter ii old jolyon goes to the opera at five o'clock the following day old jolyon sat alone a cigar between his lips and on a table by his side a cup of tea <\s>

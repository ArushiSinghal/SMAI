<s> our name is forsyte my dear replied jolyon in the ironical voice to which his impetuous daughter had never quite grown accustomed and forsytes you know are people who so settle their property that their grandchildren in case they should die before their parents have to make wills leaving the property that will only come to themselves when their parents die <\s>
<s> do you follow that <\s>
<s> nor do i but it's a fact anyway we live by the principle that so long as there is a possibility of keeping wealth in the family it must not go out if you die unmarried your money goes to jolly and holly and their children if they marry <\s>
<s> isn't it pleasant to know that whatever you do you can none of you be destitute <\s>
<s> but can't i borrow the money <\s>
<s> jolyon shook his head <\s>
<s> you could rent a gallery no doubt if you could manage it out of your income <\s>
<s> june uttered a contemptuous sound <\s>

<s> my dear child murmured jolyon wouldn't it come to the same thing <\s>
<s> no said june shrewdly i could buy for ten thousand that would only be four hundred a year <\s>
<s> but i should have to pay a thousand a year rent and that would only leave me five hundred <\s>
<s> if i had the gallery dad think what i could do <\s>
<s> irene uncovered her lips and both her hands made a writhing gesture in front of her breast <\s>
<s> she said under her breath <\s>
<s> but he stood holding on to them trying to stare into her eyes which did not waver <\s>
<s> then she said quietly i am alone here <\s>
<s> you won't behave again as you once behaved <\s>
<s> dropping her hands as though they had been hot irons he turned away <\s>
<s> was it possible that there could be such relentless unforgiveness <\s>
<s> could that one act of violent possession be still alive within her <\s>
<s> did it bar him thus utterly <\s>
<s> and doggedly he said without looking up i am not going till you've answered me <\s>
<s> i am offering what few men would bring themselves to offer i want a a reasonable answer <\s>
<s> and almost with surprise he heard her say you can't have a reasonable answer <\s>
<s> reason has nothing to do with it <\s>
<s> you can only have the brutal truth i would rather die <\s>
<s> soames stared at her <\s>
<s> and there intervened in him a sort of paralysis of speech and movement the kind of quivering which comes when a man has received a deadly insult and does not yet know how he is going to take it or rather what it is going to do with him <\s>
<s> he said again as bad as that <\s>
<s> you would rather die <\s>
<s> you wanted me to answer <\s>
<s> i can't help the truth can i <\s>
<s> at that queer spiritual appeal soames turned for relief to actuality <\s>
<s> he snapped the brooch back into its case and put it in his pocket <\s>
<s> he said there's no such thing with women <\s>
<s> he heard the whisper yes nerves don't lie <\s>
<s> haven't you discovered that <\s>
<s> he was silent obsessed by the thought i will hate this woman <\s>
<s> i will hate her <\s>
<s> that was the trouble <\s>
<s> if only he could <\s>
<s> he shot a glance at her who stood unmoving against the wall with her head up and her hands clasped for all the world as if she were going to be shot <\s>
<s> and he said quickly i don't believe a word of it <\s>
<s> you have a lover <\s>
<s> if you hadn't you wouldn't be such a such a little idiot <\s>
<s> he was conscious before the expression in her eyes that he had uttered something of a non sequitur and dropped back too abruptly into the verbal freedom of his connubial days <\s>
<s> he turned away to the door <\s>
<s> but he could not go out <\s>
<s> something within him that most deep and secret forsyte quality the impossibility of letting go the impossibility of seeing the fantastic and forlorn nature of his own tenacity prevented him <\s>
<s> he turned about again and there stood with his back against the door as hers was against the wall opposite quite unconscious of anything ridiculous in this separation by the whole width of the room <\s>
<s> do you ever think of anybody but yourself <\s>
<s> irene's lips quivered then she answered slowly do you ever think that i found out my mistake my hopeless terrible mistake the very first week of our marriage that i went on trying three years you know i went on trying <\s>
<s> was it for myself <\s>
<s> soames gritted his teeth <\s>
<s> god knows what it was <\s>
<s> i've never understood you i shall never understand you <\s>
<s> you had everything you wanted and you can have it again and more <\s>
<s> what's the matter with me <\s>
<s> i ask you a plain question what is it <\s>
<s> unconscious of the pathos in that enquiry he went on passionately i'm not lame i'm not loathsome i'm not a boor i'm not a fool <\s>
<s> what's the mystery about me <\s>
<s> her answer was a long sigh <\s>
<s> he clasped his hands with a gesture that for him was strangely full of expression <\s>
<s> when i came here to night i was i hoped i meant everything that i could to do away with the past and start fair again <\s>
<s> and you meet me with nerves and silence and sighs <\s>
<s> it's like it's like a spider's web <\s>
<s> that whisper from across the room maddened soames afresh <\s>
<s> well i don't choose to be in a spider's web <\s>
<s> he walked straight up to her <\s>
<s> what he had gone up to her to do he really did not know <\s>
<s> but when he was close the old familiar scent of her clothes suddenly affected him <\s>
<s> he put his hands on her shoulders and bent forward to kiss her <\s>
<s> he kissed not her lips but a little hard line where the lips had been drawn in then his face was pressed away by her hands he heard her say oh <\s>
<s> shame compunction sense of futility flooded his whole being he turned on his heel and went straight out <\s>

<s> you see when he's not walkin or takin his bath he's eatin and when he's not eatin he's sleepin and there it is <\s>
<s> there isn't an ache or a care about him anywhere <\s>
<s> well said soames there's something in that <\s>
<s> by the way let me see his will <\s>
<s> i should have to take my time about that sir he keeps it under his pillow and he'd see me while he's active <\s>
<s> i only want to know if it's the one i made said soames you take a look at its date some time and let me know <\s>
<s> yes sir but i'm sure it's the same because me and cook witnessed you remember and there's our names on it still and we've only done it once <\s>
<s> smither and jane had been proper witnesses having been left nothing in the will that they might have no interest in timothy's death <\s>
<s> it had been he fully admitted an almost improper precaution but timothy had wished it and after all aunt hester had provided for them amply <\s>
<s> very well he said good bye smither <\s>
<s> look after him and if he should say anything at any time put it down and let me know <\s>
<s> soames i'll be sure to do that <\s>
<s> it's been such a pleasant change to see you <\s>
<s> cook will be quite excited when i tell her <\s>
<s> soames shook her hand and went down stairs <\s>
<s> he stood for fully two minutes by the hat stand whereon he had hung his hat so many times <\s>
<s> so it all passes he was thinking passes and begins again <\s>
<s> and he listened if perchance the sound of timothy trailing his hobby horse might come down the well of the stairs or some ghost of an old face show over the bannisters and an old voice say why it's dear soames and we were only saying that we hadn't seen him for a week <\s>
<s> just the scent of camphor and dust motes in a sunbeam through the fanlight over the door <\s>
<s> the little old house <\s>
<s> and turning on his heel he went out and caught his train <\s>
<s> v the native heath his foot's upon his native heath his name's val dartie <\s>
<s> with some such feeling did val dartie in the fortieth year of his age set out that same thursday morning very early from the old manor house he had taken on the north side of the sussex downs <\s>
<s> his destination was newmarket and he had not been there since the autumn of 1899 when he stole over from oxford for the cambridgeshire <\s>
<s> he paused at the door to give his wife a kiss and put a flask of port into his pocket <\s>
<s> don't overtire your leg val and don't bet too much <\s>
<s> with the pressure of her chest against his own and her eyes looking into his val felt both leg and pocket safe <\s>
<s> he should be moderate holly was always right she had a natural aptitude <\s>
<s> it did not seem so remarkable to him perhaps as it might to others that half dartie as he was he should have been perfectly faithful to his young first cousin during the twenty years since he married her romantically out in the boer war and faithful without any feeling of sacrifice or boredom she was so quick so slyly always a little in front of his mood <\s>
<s> being first cousins they had decided rather needlessly to have no children and though a little sallower she had kept her looks her slimness and the colour of her dark hair <\s>
<s> val particularly admired the life of her own she carried on besides carrying on his and riding better every year <\s>
<s> perfect in its special taste and culture if that is he took down and carried over to his own collection the four barbizon pictures he had given them <\s>
<s> the still sky blue walls tile green curtains patterned with red flowers and ferns the crewel worked fire screen before the cast iron grate the mahogany cupboard with glass windows full of little knickknacks the beaded footstools keats shelley southey cowper coleridge byron's corsair but nothing else and the victorian poets in a bookshelf row the marqueterie cabinet lined with dim red plush full of family relics hester's first fan the buckles of their mother's father's shoes three bottled scorpions and one very yellow elephant's tusk sent home from india by great uncle edgar forsyte who had been in jute a yellow bit of paper propped up with spidery writing on it recording god knew what <\s>
<s> and the pictures crowding on the walls all water colours save those four barbizons looking like the foreigners they were and doubtful customers at that pictures bright and illustrative telling the bees hey for the ferry <\s>
<s> and two in the style of frith all thimblerig and crinolines given them by swithin <\s>
<s> many many pictures at which soames had gazed a thousand times in supercilious fascination a marvellous collection of bright smooth gilt frames <\s>
<s> and the boudoir grand piano beautifully dusted hermetically sealed as ever and aunt juley's album of pressed seaweed on it <\s>
<s> and the gilt legged chairs stronger than they looked <\s>
<s> and on one side of the fireplace the sofa of crimson silk where aunt ann and after her aunt juley had been wont to sit facing the light and bolt upright <\s>
<s> and on the other side of the fire the one really easy chair back to the light for aunt hester <\s>
<s> soames screwed up his eyes he seemed to see them sitting there <\s>
<s> and the atmosphere even now of too many stuffs and washed lace curtains lavender in bags and dried bees wings <\s>
<s> no he thought there's nothing like it left it ought to be preserved <\s>
<s> and by george they might laugh at it but for a standard of gentle life never departed from for fastidiousness of skin and eye and nose and feeling it beat to day hollow to day with its tubes and cars its perpetual smoking its cross legged bare necked girls visible up to the knees and down to the waist if you took the trouble agreeable to the satyr within each forsyte but hardly his idea of a lady with their feet too screwed round the legs of their chairs while they ate and their so longs and their old beans and their laughter girls who gave him the shudders whenever he thought of fleur in contact with them and the hard eyed capable older women who managed life and gave him the shudders too <\s>
<s> his old aunts if they never opened their minds their eyes or very much their windows at least had manners and a standard and reverence for past and future <\s>
<s> with rather a choky feeling he closed the door and went tiptoeing upstairs <\s>
<s> he looked in at a place on the way h'm <\s>
<s> in perfect order of the eighties with a sort of yellow oilskin paper on the walls <\s>
<s> at the top of the stairs he hesitated between four doors <\s>
<s> which of them was timothy's <\s>
<s> a sound as of a child slowly dragging a hobby horse about came to his ears <\s>
<s> that must be timothy <\s>
<s> he tapped and a door was opened by smither very red in the face <\s>
<s> timothy was taking his walk and she had not been able to get him to attend <\s>
<s> soames would come into the back room he could see him through the door <\s>
<s> soames went into the back room and stood watching <\s>
<s> the last of the old forsytes was on his feet moving with the most impressive slowness and an air of perfect concentration on his own affairs backward and forward between the foot of his bed and the window a distance of some twelve feet <\s>
<s> the lower part of his square face no longer clean shaven was covered with snowy beard clipped as short as it could be and his chin looked as broad as his brow where the hair was also quite white while nose and cheeks and brow were a good yellow <\s>
<s> one hand held a stout stick and the other grasped the skirt of his jaeger dressing gown from under which could be seen his bed socked ankles and feet thrust into jaeger slippers <\s>
<s> the expression on his face was that of a crossed child intent on something that he has not got <\s>
<s> each time he turned he stumped the stick and then dragged it as if to show that he could do without it he still looks strong said soames under his breath <\s>
<s> you should see him take his bath it's wonderful he does enjoy it so <\s>
<s> those quite loud words gave soames an insight <\s>
<s> timothy had resumed his babyhood <\s>
<s> does he take any interest in things generally <\s>
<s> he said also loud <\s>
<s> yes sir his food and his will <\s>
<s> it's quite a sight to see him turn it over and over not to read it of course and every now and then he asks the price of consols and i write it on a slate for him very large <\s>
<s> of course i always write the same what they were when he last took notice in 1914 <\s>
<s> we got the doctor to forbid him to read the paper when the war broke out <\s>
<s> he did take on about that at first <\s>
<s> but he soon came round because he knew it tired him and he's a wonder to conserve energy as he used to call it when my dear mistresses were alive bless their hearts <\s>
<s> how he did go on at them about that they were always so active if you remember mr <\s>
<s> what would happen if i were to go in <\s>
<s> asked soames would he remember me <\s>
<s> i made his will you know after miss hester died in 1907 <\s>
<s> that sir replied smither doubtfully i couldn't take on me to say <\s>
<s> i think he might he really is a wonderful man for his age <\s>
<s> soames moved into the doorway and waiting for timothy to turn said in a loud voice uncle timothy <\s>
<s> timothy trailed back half way and halted <\s>
<s> soames cried soames at the top of his voice holding out his hand soames forsyte <\s>
<s> said timothy and stumping his stick loudly on the floor he continued his walk <\s>
<s> it doesn't seem to work said soames <\s>
<s> no sir replied smither rather crestfallen you see he hasn't finished his walk <\s>
<s> it always was one thing at a time with him <\s>
<s> i expect he'll ask me this afternoon if you came about the gas and a pretty job i shall have to make him understand <\s>
<s> do you think he ought to have a man about him <\s>
<s> smither held up her hands <\s>
<s> cook and me can manage perfectly <\s>
<s> a strange man about would send him crazy in no time <\s>
<s> and my mistresses wouldn't like the idea of a man in the house <\s>
<s> besides we're so proud of him <\s>
<s> i suppose the doctor comes <\s>
<s> he makes special terms for such a quantity and mr <\s>
<s> timothy's so used he doesn't take a bit of notice except to put out his tongue <\s>
<s> well said soames turning away it's rather sad and painful to me <\s>
<s> sir returned smither anxiously you mustn't think that <\s>
<s> now that he can't worry about things he quite enjoys his life really he does <\s>
<s> as i say to cook mr <\s>

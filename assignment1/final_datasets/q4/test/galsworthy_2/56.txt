<s> soames clenched his hands <\s>
<s> given him up and why <\s>
<s> what had been wrong with him <\s>
<s> and once more he felt the malaise of one who contemplates himself as seen by another like a dog who chances on his refection in a mirror and is intrigued and anxious at the unseizable thing <\s>
<s> not in a hurry to get home he dined in town at the connoisseurs <\s>
<s> while eating a pear it suddenly occurred to him that if he had not gone down to robin hill the boy might not have so decided <\s>
<s> he remembered the expression on his face while his mother was refusing the hand he had held out <\s>
<s> a strange an awkward thought <\s>
<s> had fleur cooked her own goose by trying to make too sure <\s>
<s> he reached home at half past nine <\s>
<s> while the car was passing in at one drive gate he heard the grinding sputter of a motor cycle passing out by the other <\s>
<s> young mont no doubt so fleur had not been lonely <\s>
<s> but he went in with a sinking heart <\s>
<s> in the cream panelled drawing room she was sitting with her elbows on her knees and her chin on her clasped hands in front of a white camellia plant which filled the fireplace <\s>
<s> that glance at her before she saw him renewed his dread <\s>
<s> what was she seeing among those white camellias <\s>
<s> soames shook his head <\s>
<s> his tongue failed him <\s>
<s> this was murderous work <\s>
<s> he saw her eyes dilate her lips quivering <\s>
<s> my dear said soames i i did my best but and again he shook his head <\s>
<s> fleur ran to him and put a hand on each of his shoulders <\s>
<s> no muttered soames he <\s>
<s> i was to tell you that it was no use he must do what his father wished before he died <\s>
<s> he caught her by the waist <\s>
<s> come child don't let them hurt you <\s>
<s> they're not worth your little finger <\s>
<s> fleur tore herself from his grasp <\s>
<s> you didn't you couldn't have tried <\s>
<s> you you betrayed me father <\s>
<s> bitterly wounded soames gazed at her passionate figure writhing there in front of him <\s>
<s> you didn't try you didn't i was a fool <\s>
<s> i won't believe he could he ever could <\s>
<s> why did i ask you <\s>
<s> yes said soames quietly why did you <\s>
<s> i swallowed my feelings i did my best for you against my judgment and this is my reward <\s>
<s> with every nerve in his body twitching he went toward the door <\s>
<s> fleur darted after him <\s>
<s> he gives me up <\s>
<s> soames turned and forced himself to answer yes <\s>
<s> what did you what could you have done in those old days <\s>
<s> the breathless sense of really monstrous injustice cut the power of speech in soames throat <\s>
<s> what had he done <\s>
<s> what had they done to him <\s>
<s> and with quite unconscious dignity he put his hand on his breast and looked at her <\s>
<s> he mounted slow and icy to his picture gallery and paced among his treasures <\s>
<s> and who had spoiled her <\s>
<s> he stood still before the goya copy <\s>
<s> accustomed to her own way in everything <\s>
<s> flower of his life <\s>
<s> and now that she couldn't have it <\s>
<s> he turned to the window for some air <\s>
<s> daylight was dying the moon rising gold behind the poplars <\s>
<s> what sound was that <\s>
<s> a dark tune with a thrum and a throb <\s>
<s> she had set it going what comfort could she get from that <\s>
<s> his eyes caught movement down there beyond the lawn under the trellis of rambler roses and young acacia trees where the moonlight fell <\s>
<s> there she was roaming up and down <\s>
<s> his heart gave a little sickening jump <\s>
<s> what would she do under this blow <\s>
<s> how could he tell <\s>
<s> what did he know of her he had only loved her all his life looked on her as the apple of his eye <\s>
<s> he knew nothing had no notion <\s>
<s> there she was and that dark tune and the river gleaming in the moonlight <\s>
<s> i must go out he thought <\s>
<s> he hastened down to the drawing room lighted just as he had left it with the piano thrumming out that waltz or fox trot or whatever they called it in these days and passed through on to the verandah <\s>

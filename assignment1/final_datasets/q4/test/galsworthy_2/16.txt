<s> she snuggled up in her old attitude on the arm of his chair and what he said compared but poorly with the clear authoritative injured statement he had thought out with much care <\s>
<s> his heart felt sore as the great heart of a mother bird feels sore when its youngling flies and bruises its wing <\s>

<s> you could have what you liked <\s>
<s> half past eleven found her at watch in the gallery of court xiii and there she remained till the case of forsyte v <\s>
<s> bosinney's absence did not disquiet her she had felt instinctively that he would not defend himself <\s>
<s> at the end of the judgment she hastened down and took a cab to his rooms <\s>
<s> she passed the open street door and the offices on the three lower floors without attracting notice not till she reached the top did her difficulties begin <\s>
<s> her ring was not answered she had now to make up her mind whether she would go down and ask the caretaker in the basement to let her in to await mr <\s>
<s> bosinney's return or remain patiently outside the door trusting that no one would come up <\s>
<s> she decided on the latter course <\s>
<s> a quarter of an hour had passed in freezing vigil on the landing before it occurred to her that bosinney had been used to leave the key of his rooms under the door mat <\s>
<s> she looked and found it there <\s>
<s> for some minutes she could not decide to make use of it at last she let herself in and left the door open that anyone who came might see she was there on business <\s>
<s> this was not the same june who had paid the trembling visit five months ago those months of suffering and restraint had made her less sensitive she had dwelt on this visit so long with such minuteness that its terrors were discounted beforehand <\s>
<s> she was not there to fail this time for if she failed no one could help her <\s>
<s> like some mother beast on the watch over her young her little quick figure never stood still in that room but wandered from wall to wall from window to door fingering now one thing now another <\s>
<s> there was dust everywhere the room could not have been cleaned for weeks and june quick to catch at anything that should buoy up her hope saw in it a sign that he had been obliged for economy's sake to give up his servant <\s>
<s> she looked into the bedroom the bed was roughly made as though by the hand of man <\s>
<s> listening intently she darted in and peered into his cupboards <\s>
<s> a few shirts and collars a pair of muddy boots the room was bare even of garments <\s>
<s> she stole back to the sitting room and now she noticed the absence of all the little things he had set store by <\s>
<s> the clock that had been his mother's the field glasses that had hung over the sofa two really valuable old prints of harrow where his father had been at school and last not least the piece of japanese pottery she herself had given him <\s>
<s> all were gone and in spite of the rage roused within her championing soul at the thought that the world should treat him thus their disappearance augured happily for the success of her plan <\s>
<s> it was while looking at the spot where the piece of japanese pottery had stood that she felt a strange certainty of being watched and turning saw irene in the open doorway <\s>
<s> the two stood gazing at each other for a minute in silence then june walked forward and held out her hand <\s>
<s> irene did not take it <\s>
<s> when her hand was refused june put it behind her <\s>
<s> her eyes grew steady with anger she waited for irene to speak and thus waiting took in with who knows what rage of jealousy suspicion and curiosity every detail of her friend's face and dress and figure <\s>
<s> irene was clothed in her long grey fur the travelling cap on her head left a wave of gold hair visible above her forehead <\s>
<s> the soft fullness of the coat made her face as small as a child's <\s>
<s> unlike june's cheeks her cheeks had no colour in them but were ivory white and pinched as if with cold <\s>
<s> dark circles lay round her eyes <\s>
<s> in one hand she held a bunch of violets <\s>
<s> she looked back at june no smile on her lips and with those great dark eyes fastened on her the girl for all her startled anger felt something of the old spell <\s>
<s> she spoke first after all <\s>
<s> what have you come for <\s>
<s> but the feeling that she herself was being asked the same question made her add this horrible case <\s>
<s> i came to tell him he has lost it <\s>
<s> irene did not speak her eyes never moved from june's face and the girl cried don't stand there as if you were made of stone <\s>
<s> irene laughed i wish to god i were <\s>
<s> but june turned away stop <\s>
<s> she cried don't tell me <\s>
<s> i don't want to hear <\s>
<s> i don't want to hear what you've come for <\s>
<s> i don't want to hear <\s>
<s> and like some uneasy spirit she began swiftly walking to and fro <\s>
<s> suddenly she broke out i was here first <\s>
<s> we can't both stay here together <\s>
<s> on irene's face a smile wandered up and died out like a flicker of firelight <\s>
<s> she did not move <\s>
<s> and then it was that june perceived under the softness and immobility of this figure something desperate and resolved something not to be turned away something dangerous <\s>
<s> she tore off her hat and putting both hands to her brow pressed back the bronze mass of her hair <\s>
<s> you have no right here <\s>
<s> irene answered i have no right anywhere <\s>
<s> what do you mean <\s>
<s> i have left soames <\s>
<s> you always wanted me to <\s>
<s> june put her hands over her ears <\s>
<s> i don't want to hear anything i don't want to know anything <\s>
<s> it's impossible to fight with you <\s>
<s> what makes you stand like that <\s>
<s> why don't you go <\s>
<s> irene's lips moved she seemed to be saying where should i go <\s>
<s> june turned to the window <\s>
<s> she could see the face of a clock down in the street <\s>
<s> it was nearly four <\s>
<s> at any moment he might come <\s>
<s> she looked back across her shoulder and her face was distorted with anger <\s>
<s> but irene had not moved in her gloved hands she ceaselessly turned and twisted the little bunch of violets <\s>
<s> the tears of rage and disappointment rolled down june's cheeks <\s>
<s> how could you come <\s>
<s> you have been a false friend to me <\s>
<s> june saw that she had played a wrong card and broke down <\s>
<s> why have you come <\s>
<s> you've ruined my life and now you want to ruin his <\s>
<s> irene's mouth quivered her eyes met june's with a look so mournful that the girl cried out in the midst of her sobbing no no <\s>
<s> but irene's head bent till it touched her breast <\s>
<s> she turned and went quickly out hiding her lips with the little bunch of violets <\s>
<s> june ran to the door <\s>
<s> she heard the footsteps going down and down <\s>
<s> she called out come back irene <\s>
<s> the footsteps died away .... <\s>
<s> bewildered and torn the girl stood at the top of the stairs <\s>
<s> why had irene gone leaving her mistress of the field <\s>
<s> what did it mean <\s>
<s> had she really given him up to her <\s>
<s> or had she ... <\s>
<s> and she was the prey of a gnawing uncertainty .... <\s>
<s> bosinney did not come .... <\s>
<s> about six o'clock that afternoon old jolyon returned from wistaria avenue where now almost every day he spent some hours and asked if his grand daughter were upstairs <\s>
<s> on being told that she had just come in he sent up to her room to request her to come down and speak to him <\s>
<s> he had made up his mind to tell her that he was reconciled with her father <\s>
<s> in future bygones must be bygones <\s>
<s> he would no longer live alone or practically alone in this great house he was going to give it up and take one in the country for his son where they could all go and live together <\s>
<s> if june did not like this she could have an allowance and live by herself <\s>
<s> it wouldn't make much difference to her for it was a long time since she had shown him any affection <\s>
<s> but when june came down her face was pinched and piteous there was a strained pathetic look in her eyes <\s>
<s> she snuggled up in her old attitude on the arm of his chair and what he said compared but poorly with the clear authoritative injured statement he had thought out with much care <\s>
<s> his heart felt sore as the great heart of a mother bird feels sore when its youngling flies and bruises its wing <\s>
<s> his words halted as though he were apologizing for having at last deviated from the path of virtue and succumbed in defiance of sounder principles to his more natural instincts <\s>
<s> he seemed nervous lest in thus announcing his intentions he should be setting his granddaughter a bad example and now that he came to the point his way of putting the suggestion that if she didn't like it she could live by herself and lump it was delicate in the extreme <\s>
<s> and if by any chance my darling he said you found you didn't get on with them why i could make that all right <\s>
<s> you could have what you liked <\s>

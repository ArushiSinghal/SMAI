<s> it might be noted that he never looked at holly without her knowing of it but that she looked at him sometimes unawares <\s>

<s> tanned and wrinkled by colonial weather and the wiles inseparable from horses and handicapped by the leg which weakened in the boer war had probably saved his life in the war just past val was still much as he had been in the days of his courtship his smile as wide and charming his eyelashes if anything thicker and darker his eyes screwed up under them as bright a grey his freckles rather deeper his hair a little grizzled at the sides <\s>

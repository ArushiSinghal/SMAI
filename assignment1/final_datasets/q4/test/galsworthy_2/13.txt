<s> soames used the underground again in going home <\s>
<s> the fog was worse than ever at sloane square station <\s>
<s> through the still thick blur men groped in and out women very few grasped their reticules to their bosoms and handkerchiefs to their mouths crowned with the weird excrescence of the driver haloed by a vague glow of lamp light that seemed to drown in vapour before it reached the pavement cabs loomed dim shaped ever and again and discharged citizens bolting like rabbits to their burrows <\s>
<s> and these shadowy figures wrapped each in his own little shroud of fog took no notice of each other <\s>
<s> in the great warren each rabbit for himself especially those clothed in the more expensive fur who afraid of carriages on foggy days are driven underground <\s>
<s> one figure however not far from soames waited at the station door <\s>
<s> some buccaneer or lover of whom each forsyte thought poor devil <\s>
<s> looks as if he were having a bad time <\s>
<s> their kind hearts beat a stroke faster for that poor waiting anxious lover in the fog but they hurried by well knowing that they had neither time nor money to spare for any suffering but their own <\s>
<s> only a policeman patrolling slowly and at intervals took an interest in that waiting figure the brim of whose slouch hat half hid a face reddened by the cold all thin and haggard over which a hand stole now and again to smooth away anxiety or renew the resolution that kept him waiting there <\s>
<s> but the waiting lover if lover he were was used to policemen's scrutiny or too absorbed in his anxiety for he never flinched <\s>
<s> a hardened case accustomed to long trysts to anxiety and fog and cold if only his mistress came at last <\s>
<s> fogs last until the spring there is also snow and rain no comfort anywhere gnawing fear if you bring her out gnawing fear if you bid her stay at home <\s>

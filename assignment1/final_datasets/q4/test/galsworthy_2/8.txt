<s> little francie as she was usually called with good natured contempt was an important personage if only as a standing illustration of the attitude of forsytes towards the arts <\s>
<s> she was not really little but rather tall with dark hair for a forsyte which together with a grey eye gave her what was called a celtic appearance <\s>
<s> she wrote songs with titles like breathing sighs or kiss me mother ere i die with a refrain like an anthem kiss me mother ere i die kiss me kiss me mother ah <\s>
<s> kiss me e ere i kiss me mother ere i d d die <\s>
<s> she wrote the words to them herself and other poems <\s>
<s> in lighter moments she wrote waltzes one of which the kensington coil was almost national to kensington having a sweet dip in it <\s>
<s> it was very original <\s>
<s> then there were her songs for little people at once educational and witty especially gran'ma's porgie and that ditty almost prophetically imbued with the coming imperial spirit entitled black him in his little eye <\s>
<s> any publisher would take these and reviews like high living and the ladies genteel guide went into raptures over another of miss francie forsyte's spirited ditties sparkling and pathetic <\s>
<s> we ourselves were moved to tears and laughter <\s>
<s> miss forsyte should go far <\s>
<s> with the true instinct of her breed francie had made a point of knowing the right people people who would write about her and talk about her and people in society too keeping a mental register of just where to exert her fascinations and an eye on that steady scale of rising prices which in her mind's eye represented the future <\s>
<s> in this way she caused herself to be universally respected <\s>
<s> once at a time when her emotions were whipped by an attachment for the tenor of roger's life with its whole hearted collection of house property had induced in his only daughter a tendency towards passion she turned to great and sincere work choosing the sonata form for the violin <\s>
<s> this was the only one of her productions that troubled the forsytes <\s>
<s> they felt at once that it would not sell <\s>
<s> roger who liked having a clever daughter well enough and often alluded to the amount of pocket money she made for herself was upset by this violin sonata <\s>
<s> francie had borrowed young flageoletti from euphemia to play it in the drawing room at prince's gardens <\s>
<s> as a matter of fact roger was right <\s>
<s> it was rubbish but annoying <\s>
<s> the sort of rubbish that wouldn't sell <\s>
<s> as every forsyte knows rubbish that sells is not rubbish at all far from it <\s>
<s> and yet in spite of the sound common sense which fixed the worth of art at what it would fetch some of the forsytes aunt hester for instance who had always been musical could not help regretting that francie's music was not classical the same with her poems <\s>
<s> but then as aunt hester said they didn't see any poetry nowadays all the poems were little light things <\s>
<s> there was nobody who could write a poem like paradise lost or childe harold either of which made you feel that you really had read something <\s>
<s> still it was nice for francie to have something to occupy her while other girls were spending money shopping she was making it <\s>
<s> and both aunt hester and aunt juley were always ready to listen to the latest story of how francie had got her price increased <\s>
<s> they listened now together with swithin who sat pretending not to for these young people talked so fast and mumbled so he never could catch what they said <\s>
<s> and i can't think said mrs <\s>
<s> septimus how you do it <\s>
<s> i should never have the audacity <\s>
<s> i'd much rather deal with a man than a woman <\s>
<s> women are so sharp <\s>
<s> my dear cried mrs <\s>
<s> small i'm sure we're not <\s>
<s> euphemia went off into her silent laugh and ending with the squeak said as though being strangled oh you'll kill me some day auntie <\s>
<s> swithin saw no necessity to laugh he detested people laughing when he himself perceived no joke <\s>
<s> indeed he detested euphemia altogether to whom he always alluded as nick's daughter what's she called the pale one <\s>
<s> he had just missed being her god father indeed would have been had he not taken a firm stand against her outlandish name <\s>
<s> he hated becoming a godfather <\s>
<s> swithin then said to francie with dignity it's a fine day er for the time of year <\s>
<s> but euphemia who knew perfectly well that he had refused to be her godfather turned to aunt hester and began telling her how she had seen irene mrs <\s>
<s> soames at the church and commercial stores <\s>
<s> and soames was with her <\s>
<s> said aunt hester to whom mrs <\s>
<s> small had as yet had no opportunity of relating the incident <\s>
<s> but was she all alone in london <\s>
<s> oh no there was mr <\s>

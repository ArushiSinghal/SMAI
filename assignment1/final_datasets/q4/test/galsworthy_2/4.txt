<s> young jolyon replied yes we're a ramshackle lot the silence was now only broken by the sound of the dog balthasar's scratching <\s>
<s> old jolyon said simply i suppose i oughtn't to have come here jo but i get so lonely <\s>
<s> at these words young jolyon got up and put his hand on his father's shoulder <\s>
<s> in the next house someone was playing over and over again la donna mobile on an untuned piano and the little garden had fallen into shade the sun now only reached the wall at the end whereon basked a crouching cat her yellow eyes turned sleepily down on the dog balthasar <\s>
<s> there was a drowsy hum of very distant traffic the creepered trellis round the garden shut out everything but sky and house and pear tree with its top branches still gilded by the sun <\s>
<s> for some time they sat there talking but little <\s>
<s> then old jolyon rose to go and not a word was said about his coming again <\s>
<s> he walked away very sadly <\s>
<s> what a poor miserable place and he thought of the great empty house in stanhope gate fit residence for a forsyte with its huge billiard room and drawing room that no one entered from one week's end to another <\s>
<s> that woman whose face he had rather liked was too thin skinned by half she gave jo a bad time he knew <\s>
<s> and those sweet children <\s>
<s> what a piece of awful folly <\s>
<s> he walked towards the edgware road between rows of little houses all suggesting to him erroneously no doubt but the prejudices of a forsyte are sacred shady histories of some sort or kind <\s>
<s> society forsooth the chattering hags and jackanapes had set themselves up to pass judgment on his flesh and blood <\s>
<s> a parcel of old women <\s>
<s> he stumped his umbrella on the ground as though to drive it into the heart of that unfortunate body which had dared to ostracize his son and his son's son in whom he could have lived again <\s>
<s> he stumped his umbrella fiercely yet he himself had followed society's behaviour for fifteen years had only today been false to it <\s>
<s> he thought of june and her dead mother and the whole story with all his old bitterness <\s>
<s> he was a long time reaching stanhope gate for with native perversity being extremely tired he walked the whole way <\s>
<s> after washing his hands in the lavatory downstairs he went to the dining room to wait for dinner the only room he used when june was out it was less lonely so <\s>
<s> the evening paper had not yet come he had finished the times there was therefore nothing to do <\s>
<s> the room faced the backwater of traffic and was very silent <\s>
<s> he disliked dogs but a dog even would have been company <\s>
<s> his gaze travelling round the walls rested on a picture entitled group of dutch fishing boats at sunset the chef d'oeuvre of his collection <\s>
<s> it gave him no pleasure <\s>
<s> he closed his eyes <\s>
<s> he oughtn't to complain he knew but he couldn't help it he was a poor thing had always been a poor thing no pluck <\s>
<s> such was his thought <\s>
<s> the butler came to lay the table for dinner and seeing his master apparently asleep exercised extreme caution in his movements <\s>
<s> this bearded man also wore a moustache which had given rise to grave doubts in the minds of many members of the family especially those who like soames had been to public schools and were accustomed to niceness in such matters <\s>
<s> could he really be considered a butler <\s>
<s> playful spirits alluded to him as uncle jolyon's nonconformist george the acknowledged wag had named him sankey <\s>
<s> he moved to and fro between the great polished sideboard and the great polished table inimitably sleek and soft <\s>
<s> old jolyon watched him feigning sleep <\s>
<s> the fellow was a sneak he had always thought so who cared about nothing but rattling through his work and getting out to his betting or his woman or goodness knew what <\s>
<s> and didn't care a pin about his master <\s>
<s> but then against his will came one of those moments of philosophy which made old jolyon different from other forsytes after all why should the man care <\s>
<s> he wasn't paid to care and why expect it <\s>
<s> in this world people couldn't look for affection unless they paid for it <\s>
<s> it might be different in the next he didn't know couldn't tell <\s>
<s> and again he shut his eyes <\s>
<s> relentless and stealthy the butler pursued his labours taking things from the various compartments of the sideboard <\s>
<s> his back seemed always turned to old jolyon thus he robbed his operations of the unseemliness of being carried on in his master's presence now and then he furtively breathed on the silver and wiped it with a piece of chamois leather <\s>
<s> he appeared to pore over the quantities of wine in the decanters which he carried carefully and rather high letting his head droop over them protectingly <\s>
<s> when he had finished he stood for over a minute watching his master and in his greenish eyes there was a look of contempt after all this master of his was an old buffer who hadn't much left in him <\s>
<s> soft as a tom cat he crossed the room to press the bell <\s>

<s> i'm sure i don't know said james i can't remember names i know somebody told me soames spent a lot of money on this house he's not likely to part with it except at a good price <\s>
<s> well said old jolyon if he thinks i'm going to pay a fancy price he's mistaken <\s>

<s> no said old jolyon i haven't got as far as that and i'm not likely to i can see that very well if i'm met in this manner <\s>

<s> in the hall an inspector of police stood stolidly regarding with heavy lidded pale blue eyes the fine old english furniture picked up by james at the famous mavrojano sale in portman square <\s>

<s> i'm sure i don't know said james i can't remember names i know somebody told me soames spent a lot of money on this house he's not likely to part with it except at a good price <\s>

<s> i'm sure i don't know said james i can't remember names i know somebody told me soames spent a lot of money on this house he's not likely to part with it except at a good price <\s>

<s> i don't know anything about a policeman <\s>
<s> but i suppose you know something about him he added to old jolyon with a look of suspicion i suppose you'd better see him <\s>
<s> in the hall an inspector of police stood stolidly regarding with heavy lidded pale blue eyes the fine old english furniture picked up by james at the famous mavrojano sale in portman square <\s>

<s> old jolyon answered sternly god knows if you and your son don't <\s>
<s> but james did not reply <\s>
<s> for all men of great age even for all forsytes life has had bitter experiences <\s>

<s> at the inspector's words indeed all james doubts and fears revived <\s>

<s> i've not made up my mind he said <\s>

<s> old jolyon paid no attention to the remark <\s>

<s> james listened to this statement with a strange mixture of doubt suspicion and relief merging into a dread of something behind and tinged with the remains of his old undoubted reliance upon his elder brother's good faith and judgment <\s>
<s> there was anxiety too as to what old jolyon could have heard and how he had heard it and a sort of hopefulness arising from the thought that if june's connection with bosinney were completely at an end her grandfather would hardly seem anxious to help the young fellow <\s>

<s> i'm sure i don't know said james i can't remember names i know somebody told me soames spent a lot of money on this house he's not likely to part with it except at a good price <\s>

<s> i'm sure i don't know said james i can't remember names i know somebody told me soames spent a lot of money on this house he's not likely to part with it except at a good price <\s>

<s> i'm sure i don't know said james i can't remember names i know somebody told me soames spent a lot of money on this house he's not likely to part with it except at a good price <\s>

<s> i'm sure i don't know said james i can't remember names i know somebody told me soames spent a lot of money on this house he's not likely to part with it except at a good price <\s>

<s> i've not made up my mind he said <\s>
<s> old jolyon grumbled out think of you i'm always thinking of you but you don't think of yourself you don't think what you're letting yourself in for <\s>

<s> at a quarter past he was placing his umbrella in the stand at park lane he did not choose to relinquish his hat and coat telling warmson that he wanted to see his master he went without being announced into the study and sat down <\s>

<s> the first thing is to find out where she is i should go to stainer's about it they're the best men if they can't find her nobody can <\s>
<s> and suddenly moved to strange softness he muttered to himself poor little thing i can't tell what she was thinking about <\s>

<s> old jolyon did not rise on seeing his brother but held out his hand and exchanged with him the clasp of a forsyte <\s>

<s> well he said how are you <\s>
<s> we don't see much of you nowadays <\s>
<s> old jolyon paid no attention to the remark <\s>

<s> i'm told that new house of his is a white elephant <\s>
<s> i don't know anything about a white elephant said james i know he's lost his case and i should say he'll go bankrupt <\s>
<s> old jolyon was not slow to seize the opportunity this gave him <\s>
<s> i shouldn't wonder a bit <\s>
<s> he agreed and if he goes bankrupt the man of property' that is soames'll be out of pocket <\s>
<s> now what i was thinking was this if he's not going to live there .... <\s>
<s> seeing both surprise and suspicion in james eye he quickly went on i don't want to know anything i suppose irene's put her foot down it's not material to me <\s>
<s> but i'm thinking of a house in the country myself not too far from london and if it suited me i don't say that i mightn't look at it at a price <\s>
<s> james listened to this statement with a strange mixture of doubt suspicion and relief merging into a dread of something behind and tinged with the remains of his old undoubted reliance upon his elder brother's good faith and judgment <\s>
<s> there was anxiety too as to what old jolyon could have heard and how he had heard it and a sort of hopefulness arising from the thought that if june's connection with bosinney were completely at an end her grandfather would hardly seem anxious to help the young fellow <\s>
<s> altogether he was puzzled as he did not like either to show this or to commit himself in any way he said they tell me you're altering your will in favour of your son <\s>

<s> who told you that <\s>
<s> i'm sure i don't know said james i can't remember names i know somebody told me soames spent a lot of money on this house he's not likely to part with it except at a good price <\s>
<s> well said old jolyon if he thinks i'm going to pay a fancy price he's mistaken <\s>
<s> i've not got the money to throw away that he seems to have <\s>

<s> an old man wanting to look on beauty <\s>
<s> age closed his mouth paralysed his power to fight <\s>
<s> he had no right to what was warm and living no right to anything but memories and sorrow <\s>
<s> he could not plead with her even an old man has his dignity <\s>
<s> for an hour lost to bodily fatigue he paced up and down past the bowl of carnations he had plucked which mocked him with its scent <\s>
<s> of all things hard to bear the prostration of will power is hardest for one who has always had his way <\s>
<s> nature had got him in its net and like an unhappy fish he turned and swam at the meshes here and there found no hole no breaking point <\s>
<s> they brought him tea at five o'clock and a letter <\s>
<s> for a moment hope beat up in him <\s>
<s> he cut the envelope with the butter knife and read dearest uncle jolyon i can't bear to write anything that may disappoint you but i was too cowardly to tell you last night <\s>
<s> i feel i can't come down and give holly any more lessons now that june is coming back <\s>
<s> some things go too deep to be forgotten <\s>
<s> it has been such a joy to see you and holly <\s>
<s> perhaps i shall still see you sometimes when you come up though i'm sure it's not good for you i can see you are tiring yourself too much <\s>
<s> i believe you ought to rest quite quietly all this hot weather and now you have your son and june coming back you will be so happy <\s>
<s> thank you a million times for all your sweetness to me <\s>
<s> so there it was <\s>
<s> not good for him to have pleasure and what he chiefly cared about to try and put off feeling the inevitable end of all things the approach of death with its stealthy rustling footsteps <\s>
<s> not good for him <\s>
<s> not even she could see how she was his new lease of interest in life the incarnation of all the beauty he felt slipping from him <\s>
<s> his tea grew cold his cigar remained unlit and up and down he paced torn between his dignity and his hold on life <\s>
<s> intolerable to be squeezed out slowly without a say of your own to live on when your will was in the hands of others bent on weighing you to the ground with care and love <\s>
<s> he would see what telling her the truth would do the truth that he wanted the sight of her more than just a lingering on <\s>
<s> he sat down at his old bureau and took a pen <\s>
<s> but he could not write <\s>
<s> there was something revolting in having to plead like this plead that she should warm his eyes with her beauty <\s>
<s> it was tantamount to confessing dotage <\s>
<s> he simply could not <\s>
<s> and instead he wrote i had hoped that the memory of old sores would not be allowed to stand in the way of what is a pleasure and a profit to me and my little grand daughter <\s>
<s> but old men learn to forego their whims they are obliged to even the whim to live must be foregone sooner or later and perhaps the sooner the better <\s>
<s> my love to you jolyon forsyte <\s>
<s> bitter he thought but i can't help it <\s>
<s> he sealed and dropped it into the box for the evening post and hearing it fall to the bottom thought there goes all i've looked forward to <\s>
<s> that evening after dinner which he scarcely touched after his cigar which he left half smoked for it made him feel faint he went very slowly upstairs and stole into the night nursery <\s>
<s> he sat down on the window seat <\s>
<s> a night light was burning and he could just see holly's face with one hand underneath the cheek <\s>
<s> an early cockchafer buzzed in the japanese paper with which they had filled the grate and one of the horses in the stable stamped restlessly <\s>
<s> to sleep like that child <\s>
<s> he pressed apart two rungs of the venetian blind and looked out <\s>
<s> the moon was rising blood red <\s>
<s> he had never seen so red a moon <\s>
<s> the woods and fields out there were dropping to sleep too in the last glimmer of the summer light <\s>
<s> and beauty like a spirit walked <\s>
<s> i've had a long life he thought the best of nearly everything <\s>
<s> i'm an ungrateful chap i've seen a lot of beauty in my time <\s>
<s> poor young bosinney said i had a sense of beauty <\s>
<s> there's a man in the moon to night <\s>

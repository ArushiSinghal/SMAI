<s> i suppose i'd better change into a shooter he muttered escaping to his room <\s>
<s> he put on the shooter a higher collar a pearl pin and his neatest grey spats to a somewhat blasphemous accompaniment <\s>

<s> a sensation such as he had known when going in to bat was playing now in the top of val's chest but he followed his mother and uncle doggedly looking at no more than he could help and thinking that the place smelled fuggy <\s>
<s> people seemed to be lurking everywhere and he plucked soames by the sleeve <\s>
<s> i say uncle you're not going to let those beastly papers in are you <\s>
<s> soames gave him the sideway look which had reduced many to silence in its time <\s>
<s> in here he said <\s>
<s> meeting her eyes a flood of feeling nearly mastered him <\s>
<s> take care of yourself my dear <\s>
<s> he had a stumbling sensation in his legs and feet as if his brain refused to steer him away from her <\s>
<s> from the doorway he saw her lift her hand and touch its fingers with her lips <\s>
<s> he raised his hat solemnly and did not look back again <\s>
<s> chapter vii dartie versus dartie the suit dartie versus dartie for restitution of those conjugal rights concerning which winifred was at heart so deeply undecided followed the laws of subtraction towards day of judgment <\s>
<s> this was not reached before the courts rose for christmas but the case was third on the list when they sat again <\s>
<s> winifred spent the christmas holidays a thought more fashionably than usual with the matter locked up in her low cut bosom <\s>
<s> james was particularly liberal to her that christmas expressing thereby his sympathy and relief at the approaching dissolution of her marriage with that precious rascal which his old heart felt but his old lips could not utter <\s>
<s> the disappearance of dartie made the fall in consols a comparatively small matter and as to the scandal the real animus he felt against that fellow and the increasing lead which property was attaining over reputation in a true forsyte about to leave this world served to drug a mind from which all allusions to the matter except his own were studiously kept <\s>
<s> what worried him as a lawyer and a parent was the fear that dartie might suddenly turn up and obey the order of the court when made <\s>
<s> that would be a pretty how de do <\s>
<s> the fear preyed on him in fact so much that in presenting winifred with a large christmas cheque he said it's chiefly for that chap out there to keep him from coming back <\s>
<s> it was of course to pitch away good money but all in the nature of insurance against that bankruptcy which would no longer hang over him if only the divorce went through and he questioned winifred rigorously until she could assure him that the money had been sent <\s>
<s> poor woman it cost her many a pang to send what must find its way into the vanity bag of that creature <\s>
<s> soames hearing of it shook his head <\s>
<s> they were not dealing with a forsyte reasonably tenacious of his purpose <\s>
<s> it was very risky without knowing how the land lay out there <\s>
<s> still it would look well with the court and he would see that dreamer brought it out <\s>
<s> i wonder he said suddenly where that ballet goes after the argentine never omitting a chance of reminder for he knew that winifred still had a weakness if not for dartie at least for not laundering him in public <\s>
<s> though not good at showing admiration he admitted that she was behaving extremely well with all her children at home gaping like young birds for news of their father imogen just on the point of coming out and val very restive about the whole thing <\s>
<s> he felt that val was the real heart of the matter to winifred who certainly loved him beyond her other children <\s>
<s> the boy could spoke the wheel of this divorce yet if he set his mind to it <\s>
<s> and soames was very careful to keep the proximity of the preliminary proceedings from his nephew's ears <\s>
<s> he asked him to dine at the remove and over val's cigar introduced the subject which he knew to be nearest to his heart <\s>
<s> i hear he said that you want to play polo up at oxford <\s>
<s> val became less recumbent in his chair <\s>
<s> well continued soames that's a very expensive business <\s>
<s> your grandfather isn't likely to consent to it unless he can make sure that he's not got any other drain on him <\s>
<s> and he paused to see whether the boy understood his meaning <\s>
<s> val's thick dark lashes concealed his eyes but a slight grimace appeared on his wide mouth and he muttered i suppose you mean my dad <\s>
<s> yes said soames i'm afraid it depends on whether he continues to be a drag or not and said no more letting the boy dream it over <\s>
<s> but val was also dreaming in those days of a silver roan palfrey and a girl riding it <\s>
<s> though crum was in town and an introduction to cynthia dark to be had for the asking val did not ask indeed he shunned crum and lived a life strange even to himself except in so far as accounts with tailor and livery stable were concerned <\s>
<s> to his mother his sisters his young brother he seemed to spend this vacation in seeing fellows and his evenings sleepily at home <\s>
<s> they could not propose anything in daylight that did not meet with the one response sorry i've got to see a fellow and he was put to extraordinary shifts to get in and out of the house unobserved in riding clothes until being made a member of the goat's club he was able to transport them there where he could change unregarded and slip off on his hack to richmond park <\s>
<s> he kept his growing sentiment religiously to himself <\s>
<s> not for a world would he breathe to the fellows whom he was not seeing anything so ridiculous from the point of view of their creed and his <\s>
<s> but he could not help its destroying his other appetites <\s>
<s> it was coming between him and the legitimate pleasures of youth at last on its own in a way which must he knew make him a milksop in the eyes of crum <\s>
<s> all he cared for was to dress in his last created riding togs and steal away to the robin hill gate where presently the silver roan would come demurely sidling with its slim and dark haired rider and in the glades bare of leaves they would go off side by side not talking very much riding races sometimes and sometimes holding hands <\s>
<s> more than once of an evening in a moment of expansion he had been tempted to tell his mother how this shy sweet cousin had stolen in upon him and wrecked his life <\s>
<s> but bitter experience that all persons above thirty five were spoil sports prevented him <\s>
<s> after all he supposed he would have to go through with college and she would have to come out before they could be married so why complicate things so long as he could see her <\s>

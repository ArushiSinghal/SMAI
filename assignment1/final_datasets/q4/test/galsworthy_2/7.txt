<s> he too at heart must feel that it was not business but he was committed to his own proposition <\s>
<s> would he go back upon it <\s>
<s> it was thought to be unlikely <\s>
<s> all waited with interest <\s>
<s> old jolyon held up his hand dark rimmed glasses depending between his finger and thumb quivered slightly with a suggestion of menace <\s>
<s> he addressed the strong silent shareholder <\s>
<s> knowing as you do the efforts of our late superintendent upon the occasion of the explosion at the mines do you seriously wish me to put that amendment sir <\s>
<s> old jolyon put the amendment <\s>
<s> does anyone second this <\s>
<s> he asked looking calmly round <\s>
<s> and it was then that soames looking at his uncle felt the power of will that was in that old man <\s>
<s> looking straight into the eyes of the strong silent shareholder old jolyon said i now move that the report and accounts for the year 1886 be received and adopted <\s>
<s> those in favour signify the same in the usual way <\s>
<s> the next business gentlemen .... <\s>
<s> certainly uncle jolyon had a way with him <\s>
<s> but now his attention relapsed upon bosinney <\s>
<s> odd how that fellow haunted his thoughts even in business hours <\s>
<s> irene's visit to the house but there was nothing in that except that she might have told him but then again she never did tell him anything <\s>
<s> she was more silent more touchy every day <\s>
<s> he wished to god the house were finished and they were in it away from london <\s>
<s> town did not suit her her nerves were not strong enough <\s>
<s> that nonsense of the separate room had cropped up again <\s>
<s> the meeting was breaking up now <\s>
<s> underneath the photograph of the lost shaft hemmings was buttonholed by the rev <\s>
<s> booker his bristling eyebrows wreathed in angry smiles was having a parting turn up with old scrubsole <\s>
<s> the two hated each other like poison <\s>
<s> there was some matter of a tar contract between them little mr <\s>
<s> booker having secured it from the board for a nephew of his over old scrubsole's head <\s>
<s> soames had heard that from hemmings who liked a gossip more especially about his directors except indeed old jolyon of whom he was afraid <\s>
<s> soames awaited his opportunity <\s>
<s> the last shareholder was vanishing through the door when he approached his uncle who was putting on his hat <\s>
<s> can i speak to you for a minute uncle jolyon <\s>
<s> it is uncertain what soames expected to get out of this interview <\s>
<s> apart from that somewhat mysterious awe in which forsytes in general held old jolyon due to his philosophic twist or perhaps as hemmings would doubtless have said to his chin there was and always had been a subtle antagonism between the younger man and the old <\s>
<s> it had lurked under their dry manner of greeting under their non committal allusions to each other and arose perhaps from old jolyon's perception of the quiet tenacity obstinacy he rather naturally called it of the young man of a secret doubt whether he could get his own way with him <\s>
<s> both these forsytes wide asunder as the poles in many respects possessed in their different ways to a greater degree than the rest of the family that essential quality of tenacious and prudent insight into affairs which is the highwater mark of their great class <\s>
<s> either of them with a little luck and opportunity was equal to a lofty career either of them would have made a good financier a great contractor a statesman though old jolyon in certain of his moods when under the influence of a cigar or of nature would have been capable of not perhaps despising but certainly of questioning his own high position while soames who never smoked cigars would not <\s>
<s> then too in old jolyon's mind there was always the secret ache that the son of james of james whom he had always thought such a poor thing should be pursuing the paths of success while his own son ... <\s>
<s> and last not least for he was no more outside the radiation of family gossip than any other forsyte he had now heard the sinister indefinite but none the less disturbing rumour about bosinney and his pride was wounded to the quick <\s>
<s> characteristically his irritation turned not against irene but against soames <\s>
<s> the idea that his nephew's wife why couldn't the fellow take better care of her oh <\s>
<s> as though soames could possibly take more care should be drawing to herself june's lover was intolerably humiliating <\s>
<s> and seeing the danger he did not like james hide it away in sheer nervousness but owned with the dispassion of his broader outlook that it was not unlikely there was something very attractive about irene <\s>
<s> he had a presentiment on the subject of soames communication as they left the board room together and went out into the noise and hurry of cheapside <\s>
<s> they walked together a good minute without speaking soames with his mousing mincing step and old jolyon upright and using his umbrella languidly as a walking stick <\s>
<s> they turned presently into comparative quiet for old jolyon's way to a second board led him in the direction of moorage street <\s>
<s> then soames without lifting his eyes began i've had this letter from bosinney <\s>
<s> you see what he says i thought i'd let you know <\s>
<s> i've spent a lot more than i intended on this house and i want the position to be clear <\s>
<s> old jolyon ran his eyes unwillingly over the letter what he says is clear enough he said <\s>
<s> he talks about a free hand replied soames <\s>
<s> old jolyon looked at him <\s>
<s> the long suppressed irritation and antagonism towards this young fellow whose affairs were beginning to intrude upon his own burst from him <\s>
<s> well if you don't trust him why do you employ him <\s>
<s> soames stole a sideway look it's much too late to go into that he said i only want it to be quite understood that if i give him a free hand he doesn't let me in <\s>
<s> i thought if you were to speak to him it would carry more weight <\s>
<s> no said old jolyon abruptly i'll have nothing to do with it <\s>
<s> the words of both uncle and nephew gave the impression of unspoken meanings far more important behind <\s>
<s> and the look they interchanged was like a revelation of this consciousness <\s>
<s> well said soames i thought for june's sake i'd tell you that's all i thought you'd better know i shan't stand any nonsense <\s>
<s> what is that to me <\s>
<s> old jolyon took him up <\s>
<s> i don't know said soames and flurried by that sharp look he was unable to say more <\s>
<s> don't say i didn't tell you he added sulkily recovering his composure <\s>
<s> said old jolyon i don't know what you mean <\s>
<s> you come worrying me about a thing like this <\s>
<s> i don't want to hear about your affairs you must manage them yourself <\s>
<s> very well said soames immovably i will <\s>
<s> good morning then said old jolyon and they parted <\s>
<s> soames retraced his steps and going into a celebrated eating house asked for a plate of smoked salmon and a glass of chablis he seldom ate much in the middle of the day and generally ate standing finding the position beneficial to his liver which was very sound but to which he desired to put down all his troubles <\s>
<s> when he had finished he went slowly back to his office with bent head taking no notice of the swarming thousands on the pavements who in their turn took no notice of him <\s>
<s> the evening post carried the following reply to bosinney forsyte bustard and forsyte commissioners for oaths 92001 branch lane poultry e c may 17 1887 <\s>
<s> dear bosinney i have received your letter the terms of which not a little surprise me <\s>
<s> i was under the impression that you had and have had all along a free hand for i do not recollect that any suggestions i have been so unfortunate as to make have met with your approval <\s>
<s> in giving you in accordance with your request this free hand i wish you to clearly understand that the total cost of the house as handed over to me completely decorated inclusive of your fee as arranged between us must not exceed twelve thousand pounds l 12,000 <\s>
<s> this gives you an ample margin and as you know is far more than i originally contemplated <\s>
<s> i am yours truly soames forsyte <\s>
<s> on the following day he received a note from bosinney philip baynes bosinney architect 309d sloane street s w may 18 <\s>
<s> dear forsyte if you think that in such a delicate matter as decoration i can bind myself to the exact pound i am afraid you are mistaken <\s>
<s> i can see that you are tired of the arrangement and of me and i had better therefore resign <\s>
<s> yours faithfully philip baynes bosinney <\s>
<s> soames pondered long and painfully over his answer and late at night in the dining room when irene had gone to bed he composed the following 62 montpellier square s w may 19 1887 <\s>
<s> dear bosinney i think that in both our interests it would be extremely undesirable that matters should be so left at this stage <\s>
<s> i did not mean to say that if you should exceed the sum named in my letter to you by ten or twenty or even fifty pounds there would be any difficulty between us <\s>
<s> this being so i should like you to reconsider your answer <\s>
<s> you have a free hand in the terms of this correspondence and i hope you will see your way to completing the decorations in the matter of which i know it is difficult to be absolutely exact <\s>
<s> yours truly soames forsyte <\s>
<s> bosinney's answer which came in the course of the next day was may 20 <\s>
<s> dear forsyte very well <\s>
<s> chapter vi old jolyon at the zoo old jolyon disposed of his second meeting an ordinary board summarily <\s>
<s> he was so dictatorial that his fellow directors were left in cabal over the increasing domineeringness of old forsyte which they were far from intending to stand much longer they said <\s>
<s> he went out by underground to portland road station whence he took a cab and drove to the zoo <\s>
<s> he had an assignation there one of those assignations that had lately been growing more frequent to which his increasing uneasiness about june and the change in her as he expressed it was driving him <\s>
<s> she buried herself away and was growing thin if he spoke to her he got no answer or had his head snapped off or she looked as if she would burst into tears <\s>
<s> she was as changed as she could be all through this bosinney <\s>
<s> as for telling him about anything not a bit of it <\s>
<s> and he would sit for long spells brooding his paper unread before him a cigar extinct between his lips <\s>
<s> she had been such a companion to him ever since she was three years old <\s>

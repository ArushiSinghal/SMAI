<s> the man of property <\s>
<s> his wife there and bosinney <\s>
<s> old jolyon's glance was fixed on her with the penetrating gaze from which it was difficult to hide but she was not looking at him and when she turned her face he dropped his scrutiny at once <\s>
<s> he had seen enough and too much <\s>
<s> he bent down to lift the cup of milk for her from the hearth and turning away grumbled you oughtn't to stay out so late it makes you fit for nothing <\s>
<s> he was invisible now behind his paper which he turned with a vicious crackle but when june came up to kiss him he said good night my darling in a tone so tremulous and unexpected that it was all the girl could do to get out of the room without breaking into the fit of sobbing which lasted her well on into the night <\s>
<s> when the door was closed old jolyon dropped his paper and stared long and anxiously in front of him <\s>
<s> i always knew she'd have trouble with him <\s>
<s> uneasy doubts and suspicions the more poignant that he felt himself powerless to check or control the march of events came crowding upon him <\s>
<s> was the fellow going to jilt her <\s>
<s> he longed to go and say to him look here you sir <\s>
<s> are you going to jilt my grand daughter <\s>
<s> but how could he <\s>
<s> knowing little or nothing he was yet certain with his unerring astuteness that there was something going on <\s>
<s> he suspected bosinney of being too much at montpellier square <\s>
<s> this fellow he thought may not be a scamp his face is not a bad one but he's a queer fish <\s>
<s> i don't know what to make of him <\s>
<s> i shall never know what to make of him <\s>
<s> they tell me he works like a nigger but i see no good coming of it <\s>
<s> he's unpractical he has no method <\s>
<s> when he comes here he sits as glum as a monkey <\s>
<s> if i ask him what wine he'll have he says thanks any wine <\s>
<s> if i offer him a cigar he smokes it as if it were a twopenny german thing <\s>
<s> i never see him looking at june as he ought to look at her and yet he's not after her money <\s>
<s> if she were to make a sign he'd be off his bargain to morrow <\s>
<s> but she won't not she <\s>
<s> she'll stick to him <\s>
<s> she's as obstinate as fate she'll never let go <\s>
<s> sighing deeply he turned the paper in its columns perchance he might find consolation <\s>
<s> and upstairs in her room june sat at her open window where the spring wind came after its revel across the park to cool her hot cheeks and burn her heart <\s>
<s> chapter iii drive with swithin two lines of a certain song in a certain famous old school's songbook run as follows how the buttons on his blue frock shone tra la la <\s>
<s> how he carolled and he sang like a bird ... <\s>
<s> swithin did not exactly carol and sing like a bird but he felt almost like endeavouring to hum a tune as he stepped out of hyde park mansions and contemplated his horses drawn up before the door <\s>
<s> the afternoon was as balmy as a day in june and to complete the simile of the old song he had put on a blue frock coat dispensing with an overcoat after sending adolf down three times to make sure that there was not the least suspicion of east in the wind and the frock coat was buttoned so tightly around his personable form that if the buttons did not shine they might pardonably have done so <\s>
<s> majestic on the pavement he fitted on a pair of dog skin gloves with his large bell shaped top hat and his great stature and bulk he looked too primeval for a forsyte <\s>
<s> his thick white hair on which adolf had bestowed a touch of pomatum exhaled the fragrance of opoponax and cigars the celebrated swithin brand for which he paid one hundred and forty shillings the hundred and of which old jolyon had unkindly said he wouldn't smoke them as a gift they wanted the stomach of a horse <\s>
<s> the new plaid rug <\s>
<s> he would never teach that fellow to look smart and mrs <\s>
<s> soames he felt sure had an eye <\s>
<s> the phaeton hood down i am going to drive a lady <\s>
<s> a pretty woman would want to show off her frock and well he was going to drive a lady <\s>
<s> it was like a new beginning to the good old days <\s>
<s> ages since he had driven a woman <\s>
<s> the last time if he remembered it had been juley the poor old soul had been as nervous as a cat the whole time and so put him out of patience that as he dropped her in the bayswater road he had said well i'm d  d if i ever drive you again <\s>
<s> and he never had not he <\s>
<s> going up to his horses heads he examined their bits not that he knew anything about bits he didn't pay his coachman sixty pounds a year to do his work for him that had never been his principle <\s>
<s> indeed his reputation as a horsey man rested mainly on the fact that once on derby day he had been welshed by some thimble riggers <\s>
<s> but someone at the club after seeing him drive his greys up to the door he always drove grey horses you got more style for the money some thought had called him four in hand forsyte <\s>
<s> the name having reached his ears through that fellow nicholas treffry old jolyon's dead partner the great driving man notorious for more carriage accidents than any man in the kingdom swithin had ever after conceived it right to act up to it <\s>
<s> the name had taken his fancy not because he had ever driven four in hand or was ever likely to but because of something distinguished in the sound <\s>
<s> born too soon swithin had missed his vocation <\s>
<s> coming upon london twenty years later he could not have failed to have become a stockbroker but at the time when he was obliged to select this great profession had not as yet became the chief glory of the upper middle class <\s>
<s> he had literally been forced into land agency <\s>
<s> once in the driving seat with the reins handed to him and blinking over his pale old cheeks in the full sunlight he took a slow look round adolf was already up behind the cockaded groom at the horses heads stood ready to let go everything was prepared for the signal and swithin gave it <\s>
<s> the equipage dashed forward and before you could say jack robinson with a rattle and flourish drew up at soames door <\s>
<s> irene came out at once and stepped in he afterward described it at timothy's as light as er taglioni no fuss about it no wanting this or wanting that and above all swithin dwelt on this staring at mrs <\s>
<s> septimus in a way that disconcerted her a good deal no silly nervousness <\s>
<s> to aunt hester he portrayed irene's hat <\s>
<s> not one of your great flopping things sprawling about and catching the dust that women are so fond of nowadays but a neat little he made a circular motion of his hand white veil capital taste <\s>
<s> what was it made of <\s>
<s> inquired aunt hester who manifested a languid but permanent excitement at any mention of dress <\s>
<s> returned swithin now how should i know <\s>
<s> he sank into silence so profound that aunt hester began to be afraid he had fallen into a trance <\s>
<s> she did not try to rouse him herself it not being her custom <\s>
<s> i wish somebody would come she thought i don't like the look of him <\s>
<s> but suddenly swithin returned to life <\s>
<s> made of he wheezed out slowly what should it be made of <\s>
<s> they had not gone four miles before swithin received the impression that irene liked driving with him <\s>
<s> her face was so soft behind that white veil and her dark eyes shone so in the spring light and whenever he spoke she raised them to him and smiled <\s>
<s> on saturday morning soames had found her at her writing table with a note written to swithin putting him off <\s>
<s> why did she want to put him off <\s>
<s> she might put her own people off when she liked he would not have her putting off his people <\s>
<s> she had looked at him intently had torn up the note and said very well <\s>
<s> and then she began writing another <\s>
<s> he took a casual glance presently and saw that it was addressed to bosinney <\s>
<s> what are you writing to him about <\s>
<s> irene looking at him again with that intent look said quietly something he wanted me to do for him <\s>
<s> you'll have your work cut out if you begin that sort of thing <\s>
<s> he said no more <\s>
<s> swithin opened his eyes at the mention of robin hill it was a long way for his horses and he always dined at half past seven before the rush at the club began the new chef took more trouble with an early dinner a lazy rascal <\s>
<s> he would like to have a look at the house however <\s>

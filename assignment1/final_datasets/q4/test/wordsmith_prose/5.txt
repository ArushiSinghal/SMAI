<s> if the people would constitutionally and resolutely assert their rights their representatives would be taught another lesson and for their own profit <\s>

<s> they err who suppose that venality and corruption though now spreading more and more are the master evils of this day neither these nor immoderate craving for power are so much to be deprecated as the non existence of a widely ranging intellect of an intellect which if not efficacious to infuse truth as a vital fluid into the heart might at least make it a powerful tool in the hand <\s>
<s> outward profession which for practical purposes is an act of most desirable subservience would then wait upon those objects to which inward reverence though not felt was known to be due <\s>

<s> it is not therefore inordinate desire of wealth or power which is so injurious as the means which are and must be employed in the present intellectual condition of the legislature to sustain and secure that power these are at once an effect of barrenness and a cause acting and mutually re acting incessantly <\s>
<s> an enlightened friend has in conversation observed to the author of these pages that formerly the principles of men wore better than they who held them but that now a far worse evil men are better than their principles <\s>
<s> i believe it of the deplorable quality and state of principles the public proceedings in our country furnish daily new proof <\s>
<s> it is however some consolation at this present crisis to find that of the thoughts and feelings uttered during the two debates which led me to these painful declarations such as approach towards truth which has any dignity in it come from the side of his majesty's ministers but note again those contradictions to which i have so often been obliged to advert <\s>
<s> the ministers advise his majesty publicly to express sentiments of disapprobation upon the convention of cintra and when the question of the merits or demerits of this instrument comes before them in parliament the same persons who as advisers of the crown lately condemned the treaty now in their character of representatives of the people by the manner in which they received this motion have pronounced an encomium upon it <\s>
<s> for though as i have said the motion was inaccurately and inadequately worded it was not set aside upon this ground <\s>
<s> and the parliament has therefore persisted in withholding from the insulted and injured people and from their allies the only reparation which perhaps it may be in its power to grant has refused to signify its repentance and sorrow for what hath been done without which as a previous step there can be no proof no gratifying intimation even to this country or to its allies that the future efforts of the british parliament are in a sincere spirit <\s>
<s> the guilt of the transaction therefore being neither repented of nor atoned for the course of evil is by necessity persevered in but let us turn to a brighter region <\s>
<s> the events of the last year gloriously destroying many frail fears have placed in the rank of serene and immortal truths a proposition which as an object of belief hath in all ages been fondly cherished namely that a numerous nation determined to be free may effect its purpose in despite of the mightiest power which a foreign invader can bring against it <\s>
<s> these events also have pointed out how in the ways of nature and under the guidance of society this happy end is to be attained in other words they have shewn that the cause of the people in dangers and difficulties issuing from this quarter of oppression is safe while it remains not only in the bosom but in the hands of the people or what amounts to the same thing in those of a government which being truly from the people is faithfully for them <\s>
<s> while the power remained with the provincial juntas that is with the body natural of the community for those authorities newly generated in such adversity were truly living members of that body ); every thing prospered in spain <\s>
<s> hopes of the best kind were opened out and encouraged liberal opinions countenanced and wise measures arranged and last and except as proceeding from these least of all victories in the field in the streets of the city and upon the walls of the fortress <\s>
<s> i have heretofore styled it a blessing that the spanish people became their own masters at once <\s>
<s> it was a blessing but not without much alloy as the same disinterested generous passions which preserved and would for a season still have preserved them from a bad exercise of their power impelled them to part with it too soon before labours hitherto neither tried nor thought of had created throughout the country the minor excellences indispensible for the performance of those labours before powerful minds not hitherto of general note had found time to shew themselves and before men who were previously known had undergone the proof of new situations <\s>
<s> much therefore was wanting to direct the general judgement in the choice of persons when the second delegation took place which was a removal the first we have seen had not been so of the power from the people <\s>
<s> but when a common centre became absolutely necessary the power ought to have passed from the provincial assemblies into the hands of the cortes and into none else <\s>
<s> a pernicious oligarchy crept into the place of this comprehensive this constitutional this saving and majestic assembly <\s>
<s> far be it from me to speak of the supreme junta with ill advised condemnation every man must feel for the distressful trials to which that body has been exposed <\s>
<s> but eighty men or a hundred with a king at their head veiled under a cloud of fiction we might say with reference to the difficulties of this moment begotten upon a cloud of fiction could not be an image of a nation like that of spain or an adequate instrument of their power for their ends <\s>
<s> the assembly from the smallness of its numbers must have wanted breadth of wing to extend itself and brood over spain with a quickening touch of warmth every where <\s>
<s> if also as hath been mentioned there was a want of experience to determine the judgment in choice of persons this same smallness of numbers must have unnecessarily increased the evil by excluding many men of worth and talents which were so far known and allowed as that they would surely have been deputed to an assembly upon a larger scale <\s>
<s> gratitude habit and numerous other causes must have given an undue preponderance to birth station rank and fortune and have fixed the election more than was reasonable upon those who were most conspicuous for these distinctions men whose very virtue would incline them superstitiously to respect established things and to mistrust the people towards whom not only a frank confidence but a forward generosity was the first of duties <\s>
<s> i speak not of the vices to which such men would be liable brought up under the discipline of a government administered like the old monarchy of spain the matter is both ungracious and too obvious <\s>
<s> but i began with hope and hope has inwardly accompanied me to the end <\s>
<s> the whole course of the campaign rightly interpreted has justified my hope <\s>
<s> in madrid in ferrol in corunna in every considerable place and in every part of the country over which the french have re extended their dominion we learn from their own reports that the body of the people have shewed against them to the last the most determined hostility <\s>
<s> hence it is clear that the lure which the invading usurper found himself constrained lately to hold out to the inferior orders of society in the shape of various immunities has totally failed and therefore he turns for support to another quarter and now attempts to cajole the wealthy and the privileged <\s>
<s> but this class has been taught by late decrees what it has to expect from him and how far he is to be confided in for its especial interests <\s>
<s> many individuals no doubt he will seduce but the bulk of the class even if they could be insensible to more liberal feelings cannot but be his enemies <\s>
<s> this change therefore is not merely shifting ground but retiring to a position which he himself has previously undermined <\s>
<s> here is confusion and a power warring against itself <\s>
<s> so will it ever fare with foreign tyrants when in spite of domestic abuses a people which has lived long feels that it has a country to love and where the heart of that people is sound <\s>
<s> between the native inhabitants of france and spain there has existed from the earliest period and still does exist an universal and utter dissimilitude in laws actions deportment gait manners customs join with this the difference in the language and the barrier of the pyrenees a separation and an opposition in great things and an antipathy in small <\s>
<s> ignorant then must he be of history and of the reports of travellers and residents in the two countries or strangely inattentive to the constitution of human nature who this being true can admit the belief that the spaniards numerous and powerful as they are will live under frenchmen as their lords and masters <\s>
<s> let there be added to this inherent mutual repulsiveness those recent indignities and horrible outrages and we need not fear to say that such reconcilement is impossible even without that further insuperable obstacle which we hope will exist an establishment of a free constitution in spain the intoxicated setter up of kings may fill his diary with pompous stories of the acclamations with which his solemn puppets are received he may stuff their mouths with impious asseverations and hire knees to bend before them and lips to answer with honied greetings of gratitude and love these cannot remove the old heart and put a new one into the bosom of the spectators <\s>
<s> the whole is a pageant seen for a day among men in its passage to that limbo large and broad whither as to their proper home fleet all the unaccomplish'd works of nature's hand abortive monstrous or unkindly mix'd dissolv d on earth <\s>
<s> talk not of the perishable nature of enthusiasm and rise above a craving for perpetual manifestations of things <\s>
<s> he is to be pitied whose eye can only be pierced by the light of a meridian sun whose frame can only be warmed by the heat of midsummer <\s>
<s> let us hear no more of the little dependence to be had in war upon voluntary service <\s>

<s> all which is comparatively inherent or can lay claim to any degree of permanence in the tyranny which the french nation maintains over europe rests upon two foundations first upon the despotic rule which has been established in france over a powerful people who have lately passed from a state of revolution in which they supported a struggle begun for domestic liberty and long continued for liberty and national independence and secondly upon the personal character of the man by whom that rule is exercised <\s>
<s> as to the former every one knows that despotism in a general sense is but another word for weakness <\s>
<s> let one generation disappear and a people over whom such rule has been extended if it have not virtue to free itself is condemned to embarrassment in the operations of its government and to perpetual languor with no better hope than that which may spring from the diseased activity of some particular prince on whom the authority may happen to devolve <\s>

<s> the feebleness of despotic power we have had before our eyes in the late condition of spain and prussia and in that of france before the revolution and in the present condition of austria and russia <\s>
<s> but in a new born arbitrary and military government especially if like that of france it have been immediately preceded by a popular constitution not only this weakness is not found but it possesses for the purposes of external annoyance a preternatural vigour <\s>
<s> many causes contribute to this we need only mention that fitness real or supposed being necessarily the chief and almost sole recommendation to offices of trust it is clear that such offices will in general be ably filled and their duties comparatively well executed and that from the conjunction of absolute civil and military authority in a single person there naturally follows promptness of decision concentration of effort rapidity of motion and confidence that the movements made will be regularly supported <\s>
<s> this is all which need now be said upon the subject of this first basis of french tyranny <\s>
<s> for the second namely the personal character of the chief i shall at present content myself with noting to prevent misconception that this basis is not laid in any superiority of talents in him but in his utter rejection of the restraints of morality in wickedness which acknowledges no limit but the extent of its own power <\s>
<s> let any one reflect a moment and he will feel that a new world of forces is opened to a being who has made this desperate leap <\s>
<s> it is a tremendous principle to be adopted and steadily adhered to by a man in the station which buonaparte occupies and he has taken the full benefit of it <\s>
<s> what there is in this principle of weak perilous and self destructive i may find a grateful employment in endeavouring to shew upon some future occasion <\s>
<s> but it is a duty which we owe to the present moment to proclaim in vindication of the dignity of human nature and for an admonition to men of prostrate spirit that the dominion which this enemy of mankind holds has neither been acquired nor is sustained by endowments of intellect which are rarely bestowed or by uncommon accumulations of knowledge but that it has risen from circumstances over which he had no influence circumstances which with the power they conferred have stimulated passions whose natural food hath been and is ignorance from the barbarian impotence and insolence of a mind originally of ordinary constitution lagging in moral sentiment and knowledge three hundred years behind the age in which it acts <\s>
<s> in such manner did the power originate and by the forces which i have described is it maintained <\s>
<s> this should be declared and it should be added that the crimes of buonaparte are more to be abhorred than those of other denaturalized creatures whose actions are painted in history because the author of those crimes is guilty with less temptation and sins in the presence of a clearer light <\s>
<s> no doubt in the command of almost the whole military force of europe the subject which called upon me to make these distinctions he has at this moment a third source of power which may be added to these two <\s>
<s> he himself rates this last so high either is or affects to be so persuaded of its pre eminence that he boldly announces to the world that it is madness and even impiety to resist him <\s>
<s> and sorry may we be to remember that there are british senators who if a judgement may be formed from the language which they speak are inclined to accompany him far in this opinion <\s>
<s> but the enormity of this power has in it nothing inherent or permanent <\s>
<s> two signal overthrows in pitched battles would i believe go far to destroy it <\s>
<s> germans dutch italians swiss poles would desert the army of buonaparte and flock to the standard of his adversaries from the moment they could look towards it with that confidence which one or two conspicuous victories would inspire <\s>
<s> a regiment of 900 swiss joined the british army in portugal and if the french had been compelled to surrender as prisoners of war we should have seen that all those troops who were not native frenchmen would if encouragement had been given have joined the british and the opportunity that was lost of demonstrating this fact was not among the least of the mischiefs which attended the termination of the campaign in a word the vastness of buonaparte's military power is formidable not because it is impossible to break it but because it has not yet been penetrated <\s>
<s> in this respect it may not inaptly be compared to a huge pine forest such as are found in the northern parts of this island whose ability to resist the storms is in its skirts let but the blast once make an inroad and it levels the forest and sweeps it away at pleasure <\s>
<s> a hundred thousand men such as fought at vimiera and corunna would accomplish three such victories as i have been anticipating <\s>
<s> this nation might command a military force which would drive the french out of the peninsula i do not say that we could sustain there a military force which would prevent their re entering but that we could transplant thither by a great effort one which would expel them this i maintain and it is matter of thought in which infirm minds may find both reproach and instruction <\s>
<s> the spaniards could then take possession of their own fortresses and have leisure to give themselves a blended civil and military organization complete and animated by liberty which if once accomplished they would be able to protect themselves <\s>
<s> the oppressed continental powers also seeing such unquestionable proof that great britain was sincere and earnest would lift their heads again and by so doing would lighten the burthen of war which might remain for the spaniards <\s>
<s> in treating of this plan i have presumed that a general might be placed at the head of this great military power who would not sign a treaty like that of the convention of cintra and say look at the proceedings of the board of inquiry that he was determined to this by british interests or frame any treaty in the country of an ally save one purely military for the honourable preservation if necessary of his own army or part of it to which the sole or even the main inducement was our interests contra distinguished from those of that ally a general and a ministry whose policy would be comprehensive enough to perceive that the true welfare of britain is best promoted by the independence freedom and honour of other nations and that it is only by the diffusion and prevalence of these virtues that french tyranny can be ultimately reduced or the influence of france over the rest of europe brought within its natural and reasonable limits <\s>
<s> if this attempt be above the strain and temper of the country there remains only a plan laid down upon the other principles namely service as far as is required in things rather than in men that is men being secondary to things <\s>
<s> it is not i fear possible that the moral sentiments of the british army or government should accord with those of spain in her present condition <\s>
<s> commanding power indeed as hath been said put forth in the repulse of the common enemy would tend more effectually than any thing save the prevalence of true wisdom to prevent disagreement and to obviate any temporary injury which the moral spirit of the spaniards might receive from us at all events such power should there ensue any injury would bring a solid compensation <\s>
<s> but from a middle course an association sufficiently intimate and wide to scatter every where unkindly passions and yet unable to attain the salutary point of decisive power no good is to be expected <\s>
<s> great would be the evil at this momentous period if the hatred of the spaniards should look two ways <\s>
<s> let it be as steadily fixed upon the french as the pilot's eye upon his mark <\s>
<s> military stores and arms should be furnished with unfailing liberality let troops also be supplied but let these act separately taking strong positions upon the coast if such can be found to employ twice their numbers of the enemy and above all let there be floating armies keeping the enemy in constant uncertainty where he is to be attacked <\s>
<s> the peninsula frame of spain and portugal lays that region open to the full shock of british warfare <\s>
<s> our fleet and army should act wherever it is possible as parts of one body a right hand and a left and the enemy ought to be made to feel the force of both <\s>
<s> but whatever plans be adopted there can be no success unless the execution be entrusted to generals of competent judgement <\s>
<s> that the british army swarms with those who are incompetent is too plain from successive proofs in the transactions at buenos ayres at cintra and in the result of the board of inquiry nor must we see a general appointed to command and required at the same time to frame his operations according to the opinion of an inferior officer an injunction for a recommendation from such a quarter amounts to an injunction implying that a man had been appointed to a high station of which the very persons who had appointed him deemed him unworthy else they must have known that he would endeavour to profit by the experience of any of his inferior officers from the suggestions of his own understanding at the same time by denying to the general in chief the free use of his own judgement and by the act of announcing this presumption of his incompetence to the man himself such an indignity is put upon him that his passions must of necessity be rouzed so as to leave it scarcely possible that he could draw any benefit which he might otherwise have drawn from the local knowledge or talents of the individual to whom he was referred and lastly this injunction virtually involves a subversion of all military subordination <\s>
<s> in the better times of the house of commons a minister who had presumed to write such a letter as that to which i allude would have been impeached <\s>
<s> the debates in parliament and measures of government every day furnish new proofs of the truths which i have been attempting to establish of the utter want of general principles new and lamentable proofs <\s>
<s> this moment while i am drawing towards a conclusion i learn from the newspaper reports that the house of commons has refused to declare that the convention of centra disappointed the hopes and expectations of the nation <\s>
<s> the motion according to the letter of it was ill framed for the convention might have been a very good one and still have disappointed the hopes and expectations of the nation as those might have been unwise at all events the words ought to have stood the just and reasonable hopes of the nation <\s>
<s> but the hacknied phrase of disappointed hopes and expectations' should not have been used at all it is a centre round which much delusion has gathered <\s>
<s> the convention not only did not satisfy the nation's hopes of good but sunk it into a pitfall of unimagined and unimaginable evil <\s>
<s> the hearts and understandings of the people tell them that the language of a proposed parliamentary resolution upon this occasion ought not only to have been different in the letter but also widely different in the spirit and the reader of these pages will have deduced that no terms of reprobation could in severity exceed the offences involved in and connected with that instrument <\s>
<s> but while the grand keep of the castle of iniquity was to be stormed we have seen nothing but a puny assault upon heaps of the scattered rubbish of the fortress nay for the most part on some accidental mole hills at its base <\s>
<s> i do not speak thus in disrespect to the right hon <\s>
<s> gentleman who headed this attack <\s>
<s> his mind left to itself would i doubt not have prompted something worthier and higher but he moves in the phalanx of party a spiritual body in which by strange inconsistency the hampering weakening and destroying of every individual mind of which it is composed is the law which must constitute the strength of the whole <\s>
<s> the question was whether principles affecting the very existence of society had not been violated and an arm lifted and let fall which struck at the root of honour with the aggravation of the crime having been committed at this momentous period <\s>
<s> but what relation is there between these principles and actions and being in place or out of it <\s>
<s> if the people would constitutionally and resolutely assert their rights their representatives would be taught another lesson and for their own profit <\s>
<s> their understandings would be enriched accordingly for it is there there where least suspected that the want from which this country suffers chiefly lies <\s>

<s> it is however some consolation at this present crisis to find that of the thoughts and feelings uttered during the two debates which led me to these painful declarations such as approach towards truth which has any dignity in it come from the side of his majesty's ministers but note again those contradictions to which i have so often been obliged to advert <\s>
<s> the ministers advise his majesty publicly to express sentiments of disapprobation upon the convention of cintra and when the question of the merits or demerits of this instrument comes before them in parliament the same persons who as advisers of the crown lately condemned the treaty now in their character of representatives of the people by the manner in which they received this motion have pronounced an encomium upon it <\s>
<s> for though as i have said the motion was inaccurately and inadequately worded it was not set aside upon this ground <\s>
<s> and the parliament has therefore persisted in withholding from the insulted and injured people and from their allies the only reparation which perhaps it may be in its power to grant has refused to signify its repentance and sorrow for what hath been done without which as a previous step there can be no proof no gratifying intimation even to this country or to its allies that the future efforts of the british parliament are in a sincere spirit <\s>
<s> the guilt of the transaction therefore being neither repented of nor atoned for the course of evil is by necessity persevered in but let us turn to a brighter region <\s>
<s> the events of the last year gloriously destroying many frail fears have placed in the rank of serene and immortal truths a proposition which as an object of belief hath in all ages been fondly cherished namely that a numerous nation determined to be free may effect its purpose in despite of the mightiest power which a foreign invader can bring against it <\s>
<s> these events also have pointed out how in the ways of nature and under the guidance of society this happy end is to be attained in other words they have shewn that the cause of the people in dangers and difficulties issuing from this quarter of oppression is safe while it remains not only in the bosom but in the hands of the people or what amounts to the same thing in those of a government which being truly from the people is faithfully for them <\s>
<s> while the power remained with the provincial juntas that is with the body natural of the community for those authorities newly generated in such adversity were truly living members of that body ); every thing prospered in spain <\s>
<s> hopes of the best kind were opened out and encouraged liberal opinions countenanced and wise measures arranged and last and except as proceeding from these least of all victories in the field in the streets of the city and upon the walls of the fortress <\s>
<s> i have heretofore styled it a blessing that the spanish people became their own masters at once <\s>
<s> it was a blessing but not without much alloy as the same disinterested generous passions which preserved and would for a season still have preserved them from a bad exercise of their power impelled them to part with it too soon before labours hitherto neither tried nor thought of had created throughout the country the minor excellences indispensible for the performance of those labours before powerful minds not hitherto of general note had found time to shew themselves and before men who were previously known had undergone the proof of new situations <\s>
<s> much therefore was wanting to direct the general judgement in the choice of persons when the second delegation took place which was a removal the first we have seen had not been so of the power from the people <\s>
<s> but when a common centre became absolutely necessary the power ought to have passed from the provincial assemblies into the hands of the cortes and into none else <\s>
<s> a pernicious oligarchy crept into the place of this comprehensive this constitutional this saving and majestic assembly <\s>
<s> far be it from me to speak of the supreme junta with ill advised condemnation every man must feel for the distressful trials to which that body has been exposed <\s>
<s> but eighty men or a hundred with a king at their head veiled under a cloud of fiction we might say with reference to the difficulties of this moment begotten upon a cloud of fiction could not be an image of a nation like that of spain or an adequate instrument of their power for their ends <\s>
<s> the assembly from the smallness of its numbers must have wanted breadth of wing to extend itself and brood over spain with a quickening touch of warmth every where <\s>
<s> if also as hath been mentioned there was a want of experience to determine the judgment in choice of persons this same smallness of numbers must have unnecessarily increased the evil by excluding many men of worth and talents which were so far known and allowed as that they would surely have been deputed to an assembly upon a larger scale <\s>
<s> gratitude habit and numerous other causes must have given an undue preponderance to birth station rank and fortune and have fixed the election more than was reasonable upon those who were most conspicuous for these distinctions men whose very virtue would incline them superstitiously to respect established things and to mistrust the people towards whom not only a frank confidence but a forward generosity was the first of duties <\s>
<s> i speak not of the vices to which such men would be liable brought up under the discipline of a government administered like the old monarchy of spain the matter is both ungracious and too obvious <\s>
<s> but i began with hope and hope has inwardly accompanied me to the end <\s>
<s> the whole course of the campaign rightly interpreted has justified my hope <\s>
<s> in madrid in ferrol in corunna in every considerable place and in every part of the country over which the french have re extended their dominion we learn from their own reports that the body of the people have shewed against them to the last the most determined hostility <\s>
<s> hence it is clear that the lure which the invading usurper found himself constrained lately to hold out to the inferior orders of society in the shape of various immunities has totally failed and therefore he turns for support to another quarter and now attempts to cajole the wealthy and the privileged <\s>
<s> but this class has been taught by late decrees what it has to expect from him and how far he is to be confided in for its especial interests <\s>
<s> many individuals no doubt he will seduce but the bulk of the class even if they could be insensible to more liberal feelings cannot but be his enemies <\s>
<s> this change therefore is not merely shifting ground but retiring to a position which he himself has previously undermined <\s>
<s> here is confusion and a power warring against itself <\s>
<s> so will it ever fare with foreign tyrants when in spite of domestic abuses a people which has lived long feels that it has a country to love and where the heart of that people is sound <\s>
<s> between the native inhabitants of france and spain there has existed from the earliest period and still does exist an universal and utter dissimilitude in laws actions deportment gait manners customs join with this the difference in the language and the barrier of the pyrenees a separation and an opposition in great things and an antipathy in small <\s>
<s> ignorant then must he be of history and of the reports of travellers and residents in the two countries or strangely inattentive to the constitution of human nature who this being true can admit the belief that the spaniards numerous and powerful as they are will live under frenchmen as their lords and masters <\s>
<s> let there be added to this inherent mutual repulsiveness those recent indignities and horrible outrages and we need not fear to say that such reconcilement is impossible even without that further insuperable obstacle which we hope will exist an establishment of a free constitution in spain the intoxicated setter up of kings may fill his diary with pompous stories of the acclamations with which his solemn puppets are received he may stuff their mouths with impious asseverations and hire knees to bend before them and lips to answer with honied greetings of gratitude and love these cannot remove the old heart and put a new one into the bosom of the spectators <\s>
<s> the whole is a pageant seen for a day among men in its passage to that limbo large and broad whither as to their proper home fleet all the unaccomplish'd works of nature's hand abortive monstrous or unkindly mix'd dissolv d on earth <\s>
<s> talk not of the perishable nature of enthusiasm and rise above a craving for perpetual manifestations of things <\s>
<s> he is to be pitied whose eye can only be pierced by the light of a meridian sun whose frame can only be warmed by the heat of midsummer <\s>
<s> let us hear no more of the little dependence to be had in war upon voluntary service <\s>
<s> the things with which we are primarily and mainly concerned are inward passions and not outward arrangements <\s>
<s> these latter may be given at any time when the parts to be put together are in readiness <\s>
<s> in the former instance year after year we imagined things to be what they were not and in this by a more fatal and more common delusion the thought of what things really are precludes the thought of what in a moment they may become the mind overlaid by the present cannot lift itself to attain a glimpse of the future <\s>
<s> all which is comparatively inherent or can lay claim to any degree of permanence in the tyranny which the french nation maintains over europe rests upon two foundations first upon the despotic rule which has been established in france over a powerful people who have lately passed from a state of revolution in which they supported a struggle begun for domestic liberty and long continued for liberty and national independence and secondly upon the personal character of the man by whom that rule is exercised <\s>
<s> as to the former every one knows that despotism in a general sense is but another word for weakness <\s>
<s> let one generation disappear and a people over whom such rule has been extended if it have not virtue to free itself is condemned to embarrassment in the operations of its government and to perpetual languor with no better hope than that which may spring from the diseased activity of some particular prince on whom the authority may happen to devolve <\s>
<s> this if it takes a regular hereditary course but if the succession be interrupted and the supreme power frequently usurped or given by election worse evils follow <\s>
<s> science and art must dwindle whether the power be hereditary or not and the virtues of a trajan or an antonine are a hollow support for the feeling of contentment and happiness in the hearts of their subjects such virtues are even a painful mockery something that is and may vanish in a moment and leave the monstrous crimes of a caracalla or a domitian in its place men who are probably leaders of a long procession of their kind <\s>
<s> the feebleness of despotic power we have had before our eyes in the late condition of spain and prussia and in that of france before the revolution and in the present condition of austria and russia <\s>
<s> but in a new born arbitrary and military government especially if like that of france it have been immediately preceded by a popular constitution not only this weakness is not found but it possesses for the purposes of external annoyance a preternatural vigour <\s>
<s> many causes contribute to this we need only mention that fitness real or supposed being necessarily the chief and almost sole recommendation to offices of trust it is clear that such offices will in general be ably filled and their duties comparatively well executed and that from the conjunction of absolute civil and military authority in a single person there naturally follows promptness of decision concentration of effort rapidity of motion and confidence that the movements made will be regularly supported <\s>
<s> this is all which need now be said upon the subject of this first basis of french tyranny <\s>
<s> for the second namely the personal character of the chief i shall at present content myself with noting to prevent misconception that this basis is not laid in any superiority of talents in him but in his utter rejection of the restraints of morality in wickedness which acknowledges no limit but the extent of its own power <\s>

<s> for the second namely the personal character of the chief i shall at present content myself with noting to prevent misconception that this basis is not laid in any superiority of talents in him but in his utter rejection of the restraints of morality in wickedness which acknowledges no limit but the extent of its own power <\s>

<s> what there is in this principle of weak perilous and self destructive i may find a grateful employment in endeavouring to shew upon some future occasion <\s>
<s> but it is a duty which we owe to the present moment to proclaim in vindication of the dignity of human nature and for an admonition to men of prostrate spirit that the dominion which this enemy of mankind holds has neither been acquired nor is sustained by endowments of intellect which are rarely bestowed or by uncommon accumulations of knowledge but that it has risen from circumstances over which he had no influence circumstances which with the power they conferred have stimulated passions whose natural food hath been and is ignorance from the barbarian impotence and insolence of a mind originally of ordinary constitution lagging in moral sentiment and knowledge three hundred years behind the age in which it acts <\s>
<s> in such manner did the power originate and by the forces which i have described is it maintained <\s>
<s> this should be declared and it should be added that the crimes of buonaparte are more to be abhorred than those of other denaturalized creatures whose actions are painted in history because the author of those crimes is guilty with less temptation and sins in the presence of a clearer light <\s>
<s> no doubt in the command of almost the whole military force of europe the subject which called upon me to make these distinctions he has at this moment a third source of power which may be added to these two <\s>
<s> he himself rates this last so high either is or affects to be so persuaded of its pre eminence that he boldly announces to the world that it is madness and even impiety to resist him <\s>
<s> and sorry may we be to remember that there are british senators who if a judgement may be formed from the language which they speak are inclined to accompany him far in this opinion <\s>
<s> but the enormity of this power has in it nothing inherent or permanent <\s>
<s> two signal overthrows in pitched battles would i believe go far to destroy it <\s>
<s> germans dutch italians swiss poles would desert the army of buonaparte and flock to the standard of his adversaries from the moment they could look towards it with that confidence which one or two conspicuous victories would inspire <\s>
<s> a regiment of 900 swiss joined the british army in portugal and if the french had been compelled to surrender as prisoners of war we should have seen that all those troops who were not native frenchmen would if encouragement had been given have joined the british and the opportunity that was lost of demonstrating this fact was not among the least of the mischiefs which attended the termination of the campaign in a word the vastness of buonaparte's military power is formidable not because it is impossible to break it but because it has not yet been penetrated <\s>
<s> in this respect it may not inaptly be compared to a huge pine forest such as are found in the northern parts of this island whose ability to resist the storms is in its skirts let but the blast once make an inroad and it levels the forest and sweeps it away at pleasure <\s>
<s> a hundred thousand men such as fought at vimiera and corunna would accomplish three such victories as i have been anticipating <\s>
<s> this nation might command a military force which would drive the french out of the peninsula i do not say that we could sustain there a military force which would prevent their re entering but that we could transplant thither by a great effort one which would expel them this i maintain and it is matter of thought in which infirm minds may find both reproach and instruction <\s>
<s> the spaniards could then take possession of their own fortresses and have leisure to give themselves a blended civil and military organization complete and animated by liberty which if once accomplished they would be able to protect themselves <\s>
<s> the oppressed continental powers also seeing such unquestionable proof that great britain was sincere and earnest would lift their heads again and by so doing would lighten the burthen of war which might remain for the spaniards <\s>
<s> in treating of this plan i have presumed that a general might be placed at the head of this great military power who would not sign a treaty like that of the convention of cintra and say look at the proceedings of the board of inquiry that he was determined to this by british interests or frame any treaty in the country of an ally save one purely military for the honourable preservation if necessary of his own army or part of it to which the sole or even the main inducement was our interests contra distinguished from those of that ally a general and a ministry whose policy would be comprehensive enough to perceive that the true welfare of britain is best promoted by the independence freedom and honour of other nations and that it is only by the diffusion and prevalence of these virtues that french tyranny can be ultimately reduced or the influence of france over the rest of europe brought within its natural and reasonable limits <\s>
<s> if this attempt be above the strain and temper of the country there remains only a plan laid down upon the other principles namely service as far as is required in things rather than in men that is men being secondary to things <\s>
<s> it is not i fear possible that the moral sentiments of the british army or government should accord with those of spain in her present condition <\s>
<s> commanding power indeed as hath been said put forth in the repulse of the common enemy would tend more effectually than any thing save the prevalence of true wisdom to prevent disagreement and to obviate any temporary injury which the moral spirit of the spaniards might receive from us at all events such power should there ensue any injury would bring a solid compensation <\s>
<s> but from a middle course an association sufficiently intimate and wide to scatter every where unkindly passions and yet unable to attain the salutary point of decisive power no good is to be expected <\s>
<s> great would be the evil at this momentous period if the hatred of the spaniards should look two ways <\s>
<s> let it be as steadily fixed upon the french as the pilot's eye upon his mark <\s>
<s> military stores and arms should be furnished with unfailing liberality let troops also be supplied but let these act separately taking strong positions upon the coast if such can be found to employ twice their numbers of the enemy and above all let there be floating armies keeping the enemy in constant uncertainty where he is to be attacked <\s>
<s> the peninsula frame of spain and portugal lays that region open to the full shock of british warfare <\s>
<s> our fleet and army should act wherever it is possible as parts of one body a right hand and a left and the enemy ought to be made to feel the force of both <\s>
<s> but whatever plans be adopted there can be no success unless the execution be entrusted to generals of competent judgement <\s>
<s> that the british army swarms with those who are incompetent is too plain from successive proofs in the transactions at buenos ayres at cintra and in the result of the board of inquiry nor must we see a general appointed to command and required at the same time to frame his operations according to the opinion of an inferior officer an injunction for a recommendation from such a quarter amounts to an injunction implying that a man had been appointed to a high station of which the very persons who had appointed him deemed him unworthy else they must have known that he would endeavour to profit by the experience of any of his inferior officers from the suggestions of his own understanding at the same time by denying to the general in chief the free use of his own judgement and by the act of announcing this presumption of his incompetence to the man himself such an indignity is put upon him that his passions must of necessity be rouzed so as to leave it scarcely possible that he could draw any benefit which he might otherwise have drawn from the local knowledge or talents of the individual to whom he was referred and lastly this injunction virtually involves a subversion of all military subordination <\s>
<s> in the better times of the house of commons a minister who had presumed to write such a letter as that to which i allude would have been impeached <\s>
<s> the debates in parliament and measures of government every day furnish new proofs of the truths which i have been attempting to establish of the utter want of general principles new and lamentable proofs <\s>
<s> this moment while i am drawing towards a conclusion i learn from the newspaper reports that the house of commons has refused to declare that the convention of centra disappointed the hopes and expectations of the nation <\s>
<s> the motion according to the letter of it was ill framed for the convention might have been a very good one and still have disappointed the hopes and expectations of the nation as those might have been unwise at all events the words ought to have stood the just and reasonable hopes of the nation <\s>
<s> but the hacknied phrase of disappointed hopes and expectations' should not have been used at all it is a centre round which much delusion has gathered <\s>
<s> the convention not only did not satisfy the nation's hopes of good but sunk it into a pitfall of unimagined and unimaginable evil <\s>
<s> the hearts and understandings of the people tell them that the language of a proposed parliamentary resolution upon this occasion ought not only to have been different in the letter but also widely different in the spirit and the reader of these pages will have deduced that no terms of reprobation could in severity exceed the offences involved in and connected with that instrument <\s>
<s> but while the grand keep of the castle of iniquity was to be stormed we have seen nothing but a puny assault upon heaps of the scattered rubbish of the fortress nay for the most part on some accidental mole hills at its base <\s>
<s> i do not speak thus in disrespect to the right hon <\s>
<s> gentleman who headed this attack <\s>
<s> his mind left to itself would i doubt not have prompted something worthier and higher but he moves in the phalanx of party a spiritual body in which by strange inconsistency the hampering weakening and destroying of every individual mind of which it is composed is the law which must constitute the strength of the whole <\s>
<s> the question was whether principles affecting the very existence of society had not been violated and an arm lifted and let fall which struck at the root of honour with the aggravation of the crime having been committed at this momentous period <\s>
<s> but what relation is there between these principles and actions and being in place or out of it <\s>
<s> if the people would constitutionally and resolutely assert their rights their representatives would be taught another lesson and for their own profit <\s>
<s> their understandings would be enriched accordingly for it is there there where least suspected that the want from which this country suffers chiefly lies <\s>
<s> they err who suppose that venality and corruption though now spreading more and more are the master evils of this day neither these nor immoderate craving for power are so much to be deprecated as the non existence of a widely ranging intellect of an intellect which if not efficacious to infuse truth as a vital fluid into the heart might at least make it a powerful tool in the hand <\s>
<s> outward profession which for practical purposes is an act of most desirable subservience would then wait upon those objects to which inward reverence though not felt was known to be due <\s>
<s> schemes of ample reach and true benefit would also promise best to insure the rewards coveted by personal ambition and men of baser passions finding it their interest would naturally combine to perform useful service under the direction of strong minds while men of good intentions would have their own pure satisfaction and would exert themselves with more upright i mean more hopeful cheerfulness and more successfully <\s>
<s> it is not therefore inordinate desire of wealth or power which is so injurious as the means which are and must be employed in the present intellectual condition of the legislature to sustain and secure that power these are at once an effect of barrenness and a cause acting and mutually re acting incessantly <\s>
<s> an enlightened friend has in conversation observed to the author of these pages that formerly the principles of men wore better than they who held them but that now a far worse evil men are better than their principles <\s>
<s> i believe it of the deplorable quality and state of principles the public proceedings in our country furnish daily new proof <\s>
<s> it is however some consolation at this present crisis to find that of the thoughts and feelings uttered during the two debates which led me to these painful declarations such as approach towards truth which has any dignity in it come from the side of his majesty's ministers but note again those contradictions to which i have so often been obliged to advert <\s>
<s> the ministers advise his majesty publicly to express sentiments of disapprobation upon the convention of cintra and when the question of the merits or demerits of this instrument comes before them in parliament the same persons who as advisers of the crown lately condemned the treaty now in their character of representatives of the people by the manner in which they received this motion have pronounced an encomium upon it <\s>
<s> for though as i have said the motion was inaccurately and inadequately worded it was not set aside upon this ground <\s>
<s> and the parliament has therefore persisted in withholding from the insulted and injured people and from their allies the only reparation which perhaps it may be in its power to grant has refused to signify its repentance and sorrow for what hath been done without which as a previous step there can be no proof no gratifying intimation even to this country or to its allies that the future efforts of the british parliament are in a sincere spirit <\s>
<s> the guilt of the transaction therefore being neither repented of nor atoned for the course of evil is by necessity persevered in but let us turn to a brighter region <\s>

<s> the ministers advise his majesty publicly to express sentiments of disapprobation upon the convention of cintra and when the question of the merits or demerits of this instrument comes before them in parliament the same persons who as advisers of the crown lately condemned the treaty now in their character of representatives of the people by the manner in which they received this motion have pronounced an encomium upon it <\s>
<s> for though as i have said the motion was inaccurately and inadequately worded it was not set aside upon this ground <\s>

<s> the guilt of the transaction therefore being neither repented of nor atoned for the course of evil is by necessity persevered in but let us turn to a brighter region <\s>
<s> the events of the last year gloriously destroying many frail fears have placed in the rank of serene and immortal truths a proposition which as an object of belief hath in all ages been fondly cherished namely that a numerous nation determined to be free may effect its purpose in despite of the mightiest power which a foreign invader can bring against it <\s>
<s> these events also have pointed out how in the ways of nature and under the guidance of society this happy end is to be attained in other words they have shewn that the cause of the people in dangers and difficulties issuing from this quarter of oppression is safe while it remains not only in the bosom but in the hands of the people or what amounts to the same thing in those of a government which being truly from the people is faithfully for them <\s>
<s> while the power remained with the provincial juntas that is with the body natural of the community for those authorities newly generated in such adversity were truly living members of that body ); every thing prospered in spain <\s>

<s> much therefore was wanting to direct the general judgement in the choice of persons when the second delegation took place which was a removal the first we have seen had not been so of the power from the people <\s>

<s> if also as hath been mentioned there was a want of experience to determine the judgment in choice of persons this same smallness of numbers must have unnecessarily increased the evil by excluding many men of worth and talents which were so far known and allowed as that they would surely have been deputed to an assembly upon a larger scale <\s>
<s> gratitude habit and numerous other causes must have given an undue preponderance to birth station rank and fortune and have fixed the election more than was reasonable upon those who were most conspicuous for these distinctions men whose very virtue would incline them superstitiously to respect established things and to mistrust the people towards whom not only a frank confidence but a forward generosity was the first of duties <\s>
<s> i speak not of the vices to which such men would be liable brought up under the discipline of a government administered like the old monarchy of spain the matter is both ungracious and too obvious <\s>

<s> the whole course of the campaign rightly interpreted has justified my hope <\s>
<s> in madrid in ferrol in corunna in every considerable place and in every part of the country over which the french have re extended their dominion we learn from their own reports that the body of the people have shewed against them to the last the most determined hostility <\s>
<s> hence it is clear that the lure which the invading usurper found himself constrained lately to hold out to the inferior orders of society in the shape of various immunities has totally failed and therefore he turns for support to another quarter and now attempts to cajole the wealthy and the privileged <\s>
<s> but this class has been taught by late decrees what it has to expect from him and how far he is to be confided in for its especial interests <\s>
<s> many individuals no doubt he will seduce but the bulk of the class even if they could be insensible to more liberal feelings cannot but be his enemies <\s>
<s> this change therefore is not merely shifting ground but retiring to a position which he himself has previously undermined <\s>
<s> here is confusion and a power warring against itself <\s>
<s> so will it ever fare with foreign tyrants when in spite of domestic abuses a people which has lived long feels that it has a country to love and where the heart of that people is sound <\s>
<s> between the native inhabitants of france and spain there has existed from the earliest period and still does exist an universal and utter dissimilitude in laws actions deportment gait manners customs join with this the difference in the language and the barrier of the pyrenees a separation and an opposition in great things and an antipathy in small <\s>
<s> ignorant then must he be of history and of the reports of travellers and residents in the two countries or strangely inattentive to the constitution of human nature who this being true can admit the belief that the spaniards numerous and powerful as they are will live under frenchmen as their lords and masters <\s>
<s> let there be added to this inherent mutual repulsiveness those recent indignities and horrible outrages and we need not fear to say that such reconcilement is impossible even without that further insuperable obstacle which we hope will exist an establishment of a free constitution in spain the intoxicated setter up of kings may fill his diary with pompous stories of the acclamations with which his solemn puppets are received he may stuff their mouths with impious asseverations and hire knees to bend before them and lips to answer with honied greetings of gratitude and love these cannot remove the old heart and put a new one into the bosom of the spectators <\s>
<s> the whole is a pageant seen for a day among men in its passage to that limbo large and broad whither as to their proper home fleet all the unaccomplish'd works of nature's hand abortive monstrous or unkindly mix'd dissolv d on earth <\s>

<s> he is to be pitied whose eye can only be pierced by the light of a meridian sun whose frame can only be warmed by the heat of midsummer <\s>
<s> let us hear no more of the little dependence to be had in war upon voluntary service <\s>
<s> the things with which we are primarily and mainly concerned are inward passions and not outward arrangements <\s>
<s> these latter may be given at any time when the parts to be put together are in readiness <\s>
<s> in the former instance year after year we imagined things to be what they were not and in this by a more fatal and more common delusion the thought of what things really are precludes the thought of what in a moment they may become the mind overlaid by the present cannot lift itself to attain a glimpse of the future <\s>
<s> all which is comparatively inherent or can lay claim to any degree of permanence in the tyranny which the french nation maintains over europe rests upon two foundations first upon the despotic rule which has been established in france over a powerful people who have lately passed from a state of revolution in which they supported a struggle begun for domestic liberty and long continued for liberty and national independence and secondly upon the personal character of the man by whom that rule is exercised <\s>
<s> as to the former every one knows that despotism in a general sense is but another word for weakness <\s>
<s> let one generation disappear and a people over whom such rule has been extended if it have not virtue to free itself is condemned to embarrassment in the operations of its government and to perpetual languor with no better hope than that which may spring from the diseased activity of some particular prince on whom the authority may happen to devolve <\s>
<s> this if it takes a regular hereditary course but if the succession be interrupted and the supreme power frequently usurped or given by election worse evils follow <\s>
<s> science and art must dwindle whether the power be hereditary or not and the virtues of a trajan or an antonine are a hollow support for the feeling of contentment and happiness in the hearts of their subjects such virtues are even a painful mockery something that is and may vanish in a moment and leave the monstrous crimes of a caracalla or a domitian in its place men who are probably leaders of a long procession of their kind <\s>
<s> the feebleness of despotic power we have had before our eyes in the late condition of spain and prussia and in that of france before the revolution and in the present condition of austria and russia <\s>
<s> but in a new born arbitrary and military government especially if like that of france it have been immediately preceded by a popular constitution not only this weakness is not found but it possesses for the purposes of external annoyance a preternatural vigour <\s>
<s> many causes contribute to this we need only mention that fitness real or supposed being necessarily the chief and almost sole recommendation to offices of trust it is clear that such offices will in general be ably filled and their duties comparatively well executed and that from the conjunction of absolute civil and military authority in a single person there naturally follows promptness of decision concentration of effort rapidity of motion and confidence that the movements made will be regularly supported <\s>
<s> this is all which need now be said upon the subject of this first basis of french tyranny <\s>
<s> for the second namely the personal character of the chief i shall at present content myself with noting to prevent misconception that this basis is not laid in any superiority of talents in him but in his utter rejection of the restraints of morality in wickedness which acknowledges no limit but the extent of its own power <\s>
<s> let any one reflect a moment and he will feel that a new world of forces is opened to a being who has made this desperate leap <\s>
<s> it is a tremendous principle to be adopted and steadily adhered to by a man in the station which buonaparte occupies and he has taken the full benefit of it <\s>
<s> what there is in this principle of weak perilous and self destructive i may find a grateful employment in endeavouring to shew upon some future occasion <\s>
<s> but it is a duty which we owe to the present moment to proclaim in vindication of the dignity of human nature and for an admonition to men of prostrate spirit that the dominion which this enemy of mankind holds has neither been acquired nor is sustained by endowments of intellect which are rarely bestowed or by uncommon accumulations of knowledge but that it has risen from circumstances over which he had no influence circumstances which with the power they conferred have stimulated passions whose natural food hath been and is ignorance from the barbarian impotence and insolence of a mind originally of ordinary constitution lagging in moral sentiment and knowledge three hundred years behind the age in which it acts <\s>
<s> in such manner did the power originate and by the forces which i have described is it maintained <\s>
<s> this should be declared and it should be added that the crimes of buonaparte are more to be abhorred than those of other denaturalized creatures whose actions are painted in history because the author of those crimes is guilty with less temptation and sins in the presence of a clearer light <\s>
<s> no doubt in the command of almost the whole military force of europe the subject which called upon me to make these distinctions he has at this moment a third source of power which may be added to these two <\s>
<s> he himself rates this last so high either is or affects to be so persuaded of its pre eminence that he boldly announces to the world that it is madness and even impiety to resist him <\s>
<s> and sorry may we be to remember that there are british senators who if a judgement may be formed from the language which they speak are inclined to accompany him far in this opinion <\s>
<s> but the enormity of this power has in it nothing inherent or permanent <\s>
<s> two signal overthrows in pitched battles would i believe go far to destroy it <\s>
<s> germans dutch italians swiss poles would desert the army of buonaparte and flock to the standard of his adversaries from the moment they could look towards it with that confidence which one or two conspicuous victories would inspire <\s>
<s> a regiment of 900 swiss joined the british army in portugal and if the french had been compelled to surrender as prisoners of war we should have seen that all those troops who were not native frenchmen would if encouragement had been given have joined the british and the opportunity that was lost of demonstrating this fact was not among the least of the mischiefs which attended the termination of the campaign in a word the vastness of buonaparte's military power is formidable not because it is impossible to break it but because it has not yet been penetrated <\s>
<s> in this respect it may not inaptly be compared to a huge pine forest such as are found in the northern parts of this island whose ability to resist the storms is in its skirts let but the blast once make an inroad and it levels the forest and sweeps it away at pleasure <\s>

<s> the oppressed continental powers also seeing such unquestionable proof that great britain was sincere and earnest would lift their heads again and by so doing would lighten the burthen of war which might remain for the spaniards <\s>

<s> let it be as steadily fixed upon the french as the pilot's eye upon his mark <\s>
<s> military stores and arms should be furnished with unfailing liberality let troops also be supplied but let these act separately taking strong positions upon the coast if such can be found to employ twice their numbers of the enemy and above all let there be floating armies keeping the enemy in constant uncertainty where he is to be attacked <\s>
<s> the peninsula frame of spain and portugal lays that region open to the full shock of british warfare <\s>
<s> our fleet and army should act wherever it is possible as parts of one body a right hand and a left and the enemy ought to be made to feel the force of both <\s>
<s> but whatever plans be adopted there can be no success unless the execution be entrusted to generals of competent judgement <\s>
<s> that the british army swarms with those who are incompetent is too plain from successive proofs in the transactions at buenos ayres at cintra and in the result of the board of inquiry nor must we see a general appointed to command and required at the same time to frame his operations according to the opinion of an inferior officer an injunction for a recommendation from such a quarter amounts to an injunction implying that a man had been appointed to a high station of which the very persons who had appointed him deemed him unworthy else they must have known that he would endeavour to profit by the experience of any of his inferior officers from the suggestions of his own understanding at the same time by denying to the general in chief the free use of his own judgement and by the act of announcing this presumption of his incompetence to the man himself such an indignity is put upon him that his passions must of necessity be rouzed so as to leave it scarcely possible that he could draw any benefit which he might otherwise have drawn from the local knowledge or talents of the individual to whom he was referred and lastly this injunction virtually involves a subversion of all military subordination <\s>
<s> in the better times of the house of commons a minister who had presumed to write such a letter as that to which i allude would have been impeached <\s>

<s> this moment while i am drawing towards a conclusion i learn from the newspaper reports that the house of commons has refused to declare that the convention of centra disappointed the hopes and expectations of the nation <\s>
<s> the motion according to the letter of it was ill framed for the convention might have been a very good one and still have disappointed the hopes and expectations of the nation as those might have been unwise at all events the words ought to have stood the just and reasonable hopes of the nation <\s>
<s> but the hacknied phrase of disappointed hopes and expectations' should not have been used at all it is a centre round which much delusion has gathered <\s>
<s> the convention not only did not satisfy the nation's hopes of good but sunk it into a pitfall of unimagined and unimaginable evil <\s>
<s> the hearts and understandings of the people tell them that the language of a proposed parliamentary resolution upon this occasion ought not only to have been different in the letter but also widely different in the spirit and the reader of these pages will have deduced that no terms of reprobation could in severity exceed the offences involved in and connected with that instrument <\s>
<s> but while the grand keep of the castle of iniquity was to be stormed we have seen nothing but a puny assault upon heaps of the scattered rubbish of the fortress nay for the most part on some accidental mole hills at its base <\s>
<s> i do not speak thus in disrespect to the right hon <\s>
<s> gentleman who headed this attack <\s>
<s> his mind left to itself would i doubt not have prompted something worthier and higher but he moves in the phalanx of party a spiritual body in which by strange inconsistency the hampering weakening and destroying of every individual mind of which it is composed is the law which must constitute the strength of the whole <\s>
<s> the question was whether principles affecting the very existence of society had not been violated and an arm lifted and let fall which struck at the root of honour with the aggravation of the crime having been committed at this momentous period <\s>
<s> but what relation is there between these principles and actions and being in place or out of it <\s>
<s> if the people would constitutionally and resolutely assert their rights their representatives would be taught another lesson and for their own profit <\s>
<s> their understandings would be enriched accordingly for it is there there where least suspected that the want from which this country suffers chiefly lies <\s>
<s> they err who suppose that venality and corruption though now spreading more and more are the master evils of this day neither these nor immoderate craving for power are so much to be deprecated as the non existence of a widely ranging intellect of an intellect which if not efficacious to infuse truth as a vital fluid into the heart might at least make it a powerful tool in the hand <\s>
<s> outward profession which for practical purposes is an act of most desirable subservience would then wait upon those objects to which inward reverence though not felt was known to be due <\s>
<s> schemes of ample reach and true benefit would also promise best to insure the rewards coveted by personal ambition and men of baser passions finding it their interest would naturally combine to perform useful service under the direction of strong minds while men of good intentions would have their own pure satisfaction and would exert themselves with more upright i mean more hopeful cheerfulness and more successfully <\s>
<s> it is not therefore inordinate desire of wealth or power which is so injurious as the means which are and must be employed in the present intellectual condition of the legislature to sustain and secure that power these are at once an effect of barrenness and a cause acting and mutually re acting incessantly <\s>
<s> an enlightened friend has in conversation observed to the author of these pages that formerly the principles of men wore better than they who held them but that now a far worse evil men are better than their principles <\s>
<s> i believe it of the deplorable quality and state of principles the public proceedings in our country furnish daily new proof <\s>
<s> it is however some consolation at this present crisis to find that of the thoughts and feelings uttered during the two debates which led me to these painful declarations such as approach towards truth which has any dignity in it come from the side of his majesty's ministers but note again those contradictions to which i have so often been obliged to advert <\s>
<s> the ministers advise his majesty publicly to express sentiments of disapprobation upon the convention of cintra and when the question of the merits or demerits of this instrument comes before them in parliament the same persons who as advisers of the crown lately condemned the treaty now in their character of representatives of the people by the manner in which they received this motion have pronounced an encomium upon it <\s>
<s> for though as i have said the motion was inaccurately and inadequately worded it was not set aside upon this ground <\s>
<s> and the parliament has therefore persisted in withholding from the insulted and injured people and from their allies the only reparation which perhaps it may be in its power to grant has refused to signify its repentance and sorrow for what hath been done without which as a previous step there can be no proof no gratifying intimation even to this country or to its allies that the future efforts of the british parliament are in a sincere spirit <\s>
<s> the guilt of the transaction therefore being neither repented of nor atoned for the course of evil is by necessity persevered in but let us turn to a brighter region <\s>
<s> the events of the last year gloriously destroying many frail fears have placed in the rank of serene and immortal truths a proposition which as an object of belief hath in all ages been fondly cherished namely that a numerous nation determined to be free may effect its purpose in despite of the mightiest power which a foreign invader can bring against it <\s>
<s> these events also have pointed out how in the ways of nature and under the guidance of society this happy end is to be attained in other words they have shewn that the cause of the people in dangers and difficulties issuing from this quarter of oppression is safe while it remains not only in the bosom but in the hands of the people or what amounts to the same thing in those of a government which being truly from the people is faithfully for them <\s>
<s> while the power remained with the provincial juntas that is with the body natural of the community for those authorities newly generated in such adversity were truly living members of that body ); every thing prospered in spain <\s>
<s> hopes of the best kind were opened out and encouraged liberal opinions countenanced and wise measures arranged and last and except as proceeding from these least of all victories in the field in the streets of the city and upon the walls of the fortress <\s>
<s> i have heretofore styled it a blessing that the spanish people became their own masters at once <\s>
<s> it was a blessing but not without much alloy as the same disinterested generous passions which preserved and would for a season still have preserved them from a bad exercise of their power impelled them to part with it too soon before labours hitherto neither tried nor thought of had created throughout the country the minor excellences indispensible for the performance of those labours before powerful minds not hitherto of general note had found time to shew themselves and before men who were previously known had undergone the proof of new situations <\s>
<s> much therefore was wanting to direct the general judgement in the choice of persons when the second delegation took place which was a removal the first we have seen had not been so of the power from the people <\s>
<s> but when a common centre became absolutely necessary the power ought to have passed from the provincial assemblies into the hands of the cortes and into none else <\s>
<s> a pernicious oligarchy crept into the place of this comprehensive this constitutional this saving and majestic assembly <\s>
<s> far be it from me to speak of the supreme junta with ill advised condemnation every man must feel for the distressful trials to which that body has been exposed <\s>
<s> but eighty men or a hundred with a king at their head veiled under a cloud of fiction we might say with reference to the difficulties of this moment begotten upon a cloud of fiction could not be an image of a nation like that of spain or an adequate instrument of their power for their ends <\s>
<s> the assembly from the smallness of its numbers must have wanted breadth of wing to extend itself and brood over spain with a quickening touch of warmth every where <\s>
<s> if also as hath been mentioned there was a want of experience to determine the judgment in choice of persons this same smallness of numbers must have unnecessarily increased the evil by excluding many men of worth and talents which were so far known and allowed as that they would surely have been deputed to an assembly upon a larger scale <\s>

<s> these events also have pointed out how in the ways of nature and under the guidance of society this happy end is to be attained in other words they have shewn that the cause of the people in dangers and difficulties issuing from this quarter of oppression is safe while it remains not only in the bosom but in the hands of the people or what amounts to the same thing in those of a government which being truly from the people is faithfully for them <\s>

<s> in the former instance year after year we imagined things to be what they were not and in this by a more fatal and more common delusion the thought of what things really are precludes the thought of what in a moment they may become the mind overlaid by the present cannot lift itself to attain a glimpse of the future <\s>
<s> all which is comparatively inherent or can lay claim to any degree of permanence in the tyranny which the french nation maintains over europe rests upon two foundations first upon the despotic rule which has been established in france over a powerful people who have lately passed from a state of revolution in which they supported a struggle begun for domestic liberty and long continued for liberty and national independence and secondly upon the personal character of the man by whom that rule is exercised <\s>
<s> as to the former every one knows that despotism in a general sense is but another word for weakness <\s>
<s> let one generation disappear and a people over whom such rule has been extended if it have not virtue to free itself is condemned to embarrassment in the operations of its government and to perpetual languor with no better hope than that which may spring from the diseased activity of some particular prince on whom the authority may happen to devolve <\s>
<s> this if it takes a regular hereditary course but if the succession be interrupted and the supreme power frequently usurped or given by election worse evils follow <\s>
<s> science and art must dwindle whether the power be hereditary or not and the virtues of a trajan or an antonine are a hollow support for the feeling of contentment and happiness in the hearts of their subjects such virtues are even a painful mockery something that is and may vanish in a moment and leave the monstrous crimes of a caracalla or a domitian in its place men who are probably leaders of a long procession of their kind <\s>
<s> the feebleness of despotic power we have had before our eyes in the late condition of spain and prussia and in that of france before the revolution and in the present condition of austria and russia <\s>
<s> but in a new born arbitrary and military government especially if like that of france it have been immediately preceded by a popular constitution not only this weakness is not found but it possesses for the purposes of external annoyance a preternatural vigour <\s>
<s> many causes contribute to this we need only mention that fitness real or supposed being necessarily the chief and almost sole recommendation to offices of trust it is clear that such offices will in general be ably filled and their duties comparatively well executed and that from the conjunction of absolute civil and military authority in a single person there naturally follows promptness of decision concentration of effort rapidity of motion and confidence that the movements made will be regularly supported <\s>
<s> this is all which need now be said upon the subject of this first basis of french tyranny <\s>
<s> for the second namely the personal character of the chief i shall at present content myself with noting to prevent misconception that this basis is not laid in any superiority of talents in him but in his utter rejection of the restraints of morality in wickedness which acknowledges no limit but the extent of its own power <\s>
<s> let any one reflect a moment and he will feel that a new world of forces is opened to a being who has made this desperate leap <\s>
<s> it is a tremendous principle to be adopted and steadily adhered to by a man in the station which buonaparte occupies and he has taken the full benefit of it <\s>
<s> what there is in this principle of weak perilous and self destructive i may find a grateful employment in endeavouring to shew upon some future occasion <\s>
<s> but it is a duty which we owe to the present moment to proclaim in vindication of the dignity of human nature and for an admonition to men of prostrate spirit that the dominion which this enemy of mankind holds has neither been acquired nor is sustained by endowments of intellect which are rarely bestowed or by uncommon accumulations of knowledge but that it has risen from circumstances over which he had no influence circumstances which with the power they conferred have stimulated passions whose natural food hath been and is ignorance from the barbarian impotence and insolence of a mind originally of ordinary constitution lagging in moral sentiment and knowledge three hundred years behind the age in which it acts <\s>
<s> in such manner did the power originate and by the forces which i have described is it maintained <\s>
<s> this should be declared and it should be added that the crimes of buonaparte are more to be abhorred than those of other denaturalized creatures whose actions are painted in history because the author of those crimes is guilty with less temptation and sins in the presence of a clearer light <\s>
<s> no doubt in the command of almost the whole military force of europe the subject which called upon me to make these distinctions he has at this moment a third source of power which may be added to these two <\s>
<s> he himself rates this last so high either is or affects to be so persuaded of its pre eminence that he boldly announces to the world that it is madness and even impiety to resist him <\s>
<s> and sorry may we be to remember that there are british senators who if a judgement may be formed from the language which they speak are inclined to accompany him far in this opinion <\s>
<s> but the enormity of this power has in it nothing inherent or permanent <\s>
<s> two signal overthrows in pitched battles would i believe go far to destroy it <\s>
<s> germans dutch italians swiss poles would desert the army of buonaparte and flock to the standard of his adversaries from the moment they could look towards it with that confidence which one or two conspicuous victories would inspire <\s>
<s> a regiment of 900 swiss joined the british army in portugal and if the french had been compelled to surrender as prisoners of war we should have seen that all those troops who were not native frenchmen would if encouragement had been given have joined the british and the opportunity that was lost of demonstrating this fact was not among the least of the mischiefs which attended the termination of the campaign in a word the vastness of buonaparte's military power is formidable not because it is impossible to break it but because it has not yet been penetrated <\s>
<s> in this respect it may not inaptly be compared to a huge pine forest such as are found in the northern parts of this island whose ability to resist the storms is in its skirts let but the blast once make an inroad and it levels the forest and sweeps it away at pleasure <\s>
<s> a hundred thousand men such as fought at vimiera and corunna would accomplish three such victories as i have been anticipating <\s>
<s> this nation might command a military force which would drive the french out of the peninsula i do not say that we could sustain there a military force which would prevent their re entering but that we could transplant thither by a great effort one which would expel them this i maintain and it is matter of thought in which infirm minds may find both reproach and instruction <\s>
<s> the spaniards could then take possession of their own fortresses and have leisure to give themselves a blended civil and military organization complete and animated by liberty which if once accomplished they would be able to protect themselves <\s>
<s> the oppressed continental powers also seeing such unquestionable proof that great britain was sincere and earnest would lift their heads again and by so doing would lighten the burthen of war which might remain for the spaniards <\s>
<s> in treating of this plan i have presumed that a general might be placed at the head of this great military power who would not sign a treaty like that of the convention of cintra and say look at the proceedings of the board of inquiry that he was determined to this by british interests or frame any treaty in the country of an ally save one purely military for the honourable preservation if necessary of his own army or part of it to which the sole or even the main inducement was our interests contra distinguished from those of that ally a general and a ministry whose policy would be comprehensive enough to perceive that the true welfare of britain is best promoted by the independence freedom and honour of other nations and that it is only by the diffusion and prevalence of these virtues that french tyranny can be ultimately reduced or the influence of france over the rest of europe brought within its natural and reasonable limits <\s>
<s> if this attempt be above the strain and temper of the country there remains only a plan laid down upon the other principles namely service as far as is required in things rather than in men that is men being secondary to things <\s>
<s> it is not i fear possible that the moral sentiments of the british army or government should accord with those of spain in her present condition <\s>
<s> commanding power indeed as hath been said put forth in the repulse of the common enemy would tend more effectually than any thing save the prevalence of true wisdom to prevent disagreement and to obviate any temporary injury which the moral spirit of the spaniards might receive from us at all events such power should there ensue any injury would bring a solid compensation <\s>
<s> but from a middle course an association sufficiently intimate and wide to scatter every where unkindly passions and yet unable to attain the salutary point of decisive power no good is to be expected <\s>
<s> great would be the evil at this momentous period if the hatred of the spaniards should look two ways <\s>
<s> let it be as steadily fixed upon the french as the pilot's eye upon his mark <\s>
<s> military stores and arms should be furnished with unfailing liberality let troops also be supplied but let these act separately taking strong positions upon the coast if such can be found to employ twice their numbers of the enemy and above all let there be floating armies keeping the enemy in constant uncertainty where he is to be attacked <\s>

<s> this moment while i am drawing towards a conclusion i learn from the newspaper reports that the house of commons has refused to declare that the convention of centra disappointed the hopes and expectations of the nation <\s>

<s> but the hacknied phrase of disappointed hopes and expectations' should not have been used at all it is a centre round which much delusion has gathered <\s>
<s> the convention not only did not satisfy the nation's hopes of good but sunk it into a pitfall of unimagined and unimaginable evil <\s>
<s> the hearts and understandings of the people tell them that the language of a proposed parliamentary resolution upon this occasion ought not only to have been different in the letter but also widely different in the spirit and the reader of these pages will have deduced that no terms of reprobation could in severity exceed the offences involved in and connected with that instrument <\s>
<s> but while the grand keep of the castle of iniquity was to be stormed we have seen nothing but a puny assault upon heaps of the scattered rubbish of the fortress nay for the most part on some accidental mole hills at its base <\s>

<s> his mind left to itself would i doubt not have prompted something worthier and higher but he moves in the phalanx of party a spiritual body in which by strange inconsistency the hampering weakening and destroying of every individual mind of which it is composed is the law which must constitute the strength of the whole <\s>
<s> the question was whether principles affecting the very existence of society had not been violated and an arm lifted and let fall which struck at the root of honour with the aggravation of the crime having been committed at this momentous period <\s>
<s> but what relation is there between these principles and actions and being in place or out of it <\s>
<s> if the people would constitutionally and resolutely assert their rights their representatives would be taught another lesson and for their own profit <\s>
<s> their understandings would be enriched accordingly for it is there there where least suspected that the want from which this country suffers chiefly lies <\s>
<s> they err who suppose that venality and corruption though now spreading more and more are the master evils of this day neither these nor immoderate craving for power are so much to be deprecated as the non existence of a widely ranging intellect of an intellect which if not efficacious to infuse truth as a vital fluid into the heart might at least make it a powerful tool in the hand <\s>
<s> outward profession which for practical purposes is an act of most desirable subservience would then wait upon those objects to which inward reverence though not felt was known to be due <\s>
<s> schemes of ample reach and true benefit would also promise best to insure the rewards coveted by personal ambition and men of baser passions finding it their interest would naturally combine to perform useful service under the direction of strong minds while men of good intentions would have their own pure satisfaction and would exert themselves with more upright i mean more hopeful cheerfulness and more successfully <\s>
<s> it is not therefore inordinate desire of wealth or power which is so injurious as the means which are and must be employed in the present intellectual condition of the legislature to sustain and secure that power these are at once an effect of barrenness and a cause acting and mutually re acting incessantly <\s>
<s> an enlightened friend has in conversation observed to the author of these pages that formerly the principles of men wore better than they who held them but that now a far worse evil men are better than their principles <\s>
<s> i believe it of the deplorable quality and state of principles the public proceedings in our country furnish daily new proof <\s>
<s> it is however some consolation at this present crisis to find that of the thoughts and feelings uttered during the two debates which led me to these painful declarations such as approach towards truth which has any dignity in it come from the side of his majesty's ministers but note again those contradictions to which i have so often been obliged to advert <\s>
<s> the ministers advise his majesty publicly to express sentiments of disapprobation upon the convention of cintra and when the question of the merits or demerits of this instrument comes before them in parliament the same persons who as advisers of the crown lately condemned the treaty now in their character of representatives of the people by the manner in which they received this motion have pronounced an encomium upon it <\s>
<s> for though as i have said the motion was inaccurately and inadequately worded it was not set aside upon this ground <\s>
<s> and the parliament has therefore persisted in withholding from the insulted and injured people and from their allies the only reparation which perhaps it may be in its power to grant has refused to signify its repentance and sorrow for what hath been done without which as a previous step there can be no proof no gratifying intimation even to this country or to its allies that the future efforts of the british parliament are in a sincere spirit <\s>
<s> the guilt of the transaction therefore being neither repented of nor atoned for the course of evil is by necessity persevered in but let us turn to a brighter region <\s>
<s> the events of the last year gloriously destroying many frail fears have placed in the rank of serene and immortal truths a proposition which as an object of belief hath in all ages been fondly cherished namely that a numerous nation determined to be free may effect its purpose in despite of the mightiest power which a foreign invader can bring against it <\s>
<s> these events also have pointed out how in the ways of nature and under the guidance of society this happy end is to be attained in other words they have shewn that the cause of the people in dangers and difficulties issuing from this quarter of oppression is safe while it remains not only in the bosom but in the hands of the people or what amounts to the same thing in those of a government which being truly from the people is faithfully for them <\s>
<s> while the power remained with the provincial juntas that is with the body natural of the community for those authorities newly generated in such adversity were truly living members of that body ); every thing prospered in spain <\s>
<s> hopes of the best kind were opened out and encouraged liberal opinions countenanced and wise measures arranged and last and except as proceeding from these least of all victories in the field in the streets of the city and upon the walls of the fortress <\s>
<s> i have heretofore styled it a blessing that the spanish people became their own masters at once <\s>
<s> it was a blessing but not without much alloy as the same disinterested generous passions which preserved and would for a season still have preserved them from a bad exercise of their power impelled them to part with it too soon before labours hitherto neither tried nor thought of had created throughout the country the minor excellences indispensible for the performance of those labours before powerful minds not hitherto of general note had found time to shew themselves and before men who were previously known had undergone the proof of new situations <\s>
<s> much therefore was wanting to direct the general judgement in the choice of persons when the second delegation took place which was a removal the first we have seen had not been so of the power from the people <\s>
<s> but when a common centre became absolutely necessary the power ought to have passed from the provincial assemblies into the hands of the cortes and into none else <\s>
<s> a pernicious oligarchy crept into the place of this comprehensive this constitutional this saving and majestic assembly <\s>
<s> far be it from me to speak of the supreme junta with ill advised condemnation every man must feel for the distressful trials to which that body has been exposed <\s>
<s> but eighty men or a hundred with a king at their head veiled under a cloud of fiction we might say with reference to the difficulties of this moment begotten upon a cloud of fiction could not be an image of a nation like that of spain or an adequate instrument of their power for their ends <\s>
<s> the assembly from the smallness of its numbers must have wanted breadth of wing to extend itself and brood over spain with a quickening touch of warmth every where <\s>
<s> if also as hath been mentioned there was a want of experience to determine the judgment in choice of persons this same smallness of numbers must have unnecessarily increased the evil by excluding many men of worth and talents which were so far known and allowed as that they would surely have been deputed to an assembly upon a larger scale <\s>
<s> gratitude habit and numerous other causes must have given an undue preponderance to birth station rank and fortune and have fixed the election more than was reasonable upon those who were most conspicuous for these distinctions men whose very virtue would incline them superstitiously to respect established things and to mistrust the people towards whom not only a frank confidence but a forward generosity was the first of duties <\s>
<s> i speak not of the vices to which such men would be liable brought up under the discipline of a government administered like the old monarchy of spain the matter is both ungracious and too obvious <\s>
<s> but i began with hope and hope has inwardly accompanied me to the end <\s>
<s> the whole course of the campaign rightly interpreted has justified my hope <\s>
<s> in madrid in ferrol in corunna in every considerable place and in every part of the country over which the french have re extended their dominion we learn from their own reports that the body of the people have shewed against them to the last the most determined hostility <\s>
<s> hence it is clear that the lure which the invading usurper found himself constrained lately to hold out to the inferior orders of society in the shape of various immunities has totally failed and therefore he turns for support to another quarter and now attempts to cajole the wealthy and the privileged <\s>
<s> but this class has been taught by late decrees what it has to expect from him and how far he is to be confided in for its especial interests <\s>
<s> many individuals no doubt he will seduce but the bulk of the class even if they could be insensible to more liberal feelings cannot but be his enemies <\s>
<s> this change therefore is not merely shifting ground but retiring to a position which he himself has previously undermined <\s>
<s> here is confusion and a power warring against itself <\s>
<s> so will it ever fare with foreign tyrants when in spite of domestic abuses a people which has lived long feels that it has a country to love and where the heart of that people is sound <\s>
<s> between the native inhabitants of france and spain there has existed from the earliest period and still does exist an universal and utter dissimilitude in laws actions deportment gait manners customs join with this the difference in the language and the barrier of the pyrenees a separation and an opposition in great things and an antipathy in small <\s>

<s> the hearts and understandings of the people tell them that the language of a proposed parliamentary resolution upon this occasion ought not only to have been different in the letter but also widely different in the spirit and the reader of these pages will have deduced that no terms of reprobation could in severity exceed the offences involved in and connected with that instrument <\s>
<s> but while the grand keep of the castle of iniquity was to be stormed we have seen nothing but a puny assault upon heaps of the scattered rubbish of the fortress nay for the most part on some accidental mole hills at its base <\s>

<s> it is not therefore inordinate desire of wealth or power which is so injurious as the means which are and must be employed in the present intellectual condition of the legislature to sustain and secure that power these are at once an effect of barrenness and a cause acting and mutually re acting incessantly <\s>

<s> i believe it of the deplorable quality and state of principles the public proceedings in our country furnish daily new proof <\s>
<s> it is however some consolation at this present crisis to find that of the thoughts and feelings uttered during the two debates which led me to these painful declarations such as approach towards truth which has any dignity in it come from the side of his majesty's ministers but note again those contradictions to which i have so often been obliged to advert <\s>
<s> the ministers advise his majesty publicly to express sentiments of disapprobation upon the convention of cintra and when the question of the merits or demerits of this instrument comes before them in parliament the same persons who as advisers of the crown lately condemned the treaty now in their character of representatives of the people by the manner in which they received this motion have pronounced an encomium upon it <\s>
<s> for though as i have said the motion was inaccurately and inadequately worded it was not set aside upon this ground <\s>

<s> the guilt of the transaction therefore being neither repented of nor atoned for the course of evil is by necessity persevered in but let us turn to a brighter region <\s>
<s> the events of the last year gloriously destroying many frail fears have placed in the rank of serene and immortal truths a proposition which as an object of belief hath in all ages been fondly cherished namely that a numerous nation determined to be free may effect its purpose in despite of the mightiest power which a foreign invader can bring against it <\s>
<s> these events also have pointed out how in the ways of nature and under the guidance of society this happy end is to be attained in other words they have shewn that the cause of the people in dangers and difficulties issuing from this quarter of oppression is safe while it remains not only in the bosom but in the hands of the people or what amounts to the same thing in those of a government which being truly from the people is faithfully for them <\s>
<s> while the power remained with the provincial juntas that is with the body natural of the community for those authorities newly generated in such adversity were truly living members of that body ); every thing prospered in spain <\s>
<s> hopes of the best kind were opened out and encouraged liberal opinions countenanced and wise measures arranged and last and except as proceeding from these least of all victories in the field in the streets of the city and upon the walls of the fortress <\s>

<s> it was a blessing but not without much alloy as the same disinterested generous passions which preserved and would for a season still have preserved them from a bad exercise of their power impelled them to part with it too soon before labours hitherto neither tried nor thought of had created throughout the country the minor excellences indispensible for the performance of those labours before powerful minds not hitherto of general note had found time to shew themselves and before men who were previously known had undergone the proof of new situations <\s>
<s> much therefore was wanting to direct the general judgement in the choice of persons when the second delegation took place which was a removal the first we have seen had not been so of the power from the people <\s>

<s> if also as hath been mentioned there was a want of experience to determine the judgment in choice of persons this same smallness of numbers must have unnecessarily increased the evil by excluding many men of worth and talents which were so far known and allowed as that they would surely have been deputed to an assembly upon a larger scale <\s>
<s> gratitude habit and numerous other causes must have given an undue preponderance to birth station rank and fortune and have fixed the election more than was reasonable upon those who were most conspicuous for these distinctions men whose very virtue would incline them superstitiously to respect established things and to mistrust the people towards whom not only a frank confidence but a forward generosity was the first of duties <\s>
<s> i speak not of the vices to which such men would be liable brought up under the discipline of a government administered like the old monarchy of spain the matter is both ungracious and too obvious <\s>
<s> but i began with hope and hope has inwardly accompanied me to the end <\s>
<s> the whole course of the campaign rightly interpreted has justified my hope <\s>
<s> in madrid in ferrol in corunna in every considerable place and in every part of the country over which the french have re extended their dominion we learn from their own reports that the body of the people have shewed against them to the last the most determined hostility <\s>
<s> hence it is clear that the lure which the invading usurper found himself constrained lately to hold out to the inferior orders of society in the shape of various immunities has totally failed and therefore he turns for support to another quarter and now attempts to cajole the wealthy and the privileged <\s>

<s> so will it ever fare with foreign tyrants when in spite of domestic abuses a people which has lived long feels that it has a country to love and where the heart of that people is sound <\s>

<s> let there be added to this inherent mutual repulsiveness those recent indignities and horrible outrages and we need not fear to say that such reconcilement is impossible even without that further insuperable obstacle which we hope will exist an establishment of a free constitution in spain the intoxicated setter up of kings may fill his diary with pompous stories of the acclamations with which his solemn puppets are received he may stuff their mouths with impious asseverations and hire knees to bend before them and lips to answer with honied greetings of gratitude and love these cannot remove the old heart and put a new one into the bosom of the spectators <\s>
<s> the whole is a pageant seen for a day among men in its passage to that limbo large and broad whither as to their proper home fleet all the unaccomplish'd works of nature's hand abortive monstrous or unkindly mix'd dissolv d on earth <\s>

<s> he is to be pitied whose eye can only be pierced by the light of a meridian sun whose frame can only be warmed by the heat of midsummer <\s>
<s> let us hear no more of the little dependence to be had in war upon voluntary service <\s>
<s> the things with which we are primarily and mainly concerned are inward passions and not outward arrangements <\s>
<s> these latter may be given at any time when the parts to be put together are in readiness <\s>
<s> in the former instance year after year we imagined things to be what they were not and in this by a more fatal and more common delusion the thought of what things really are precludes the thought of what in a moment they may become the mind overlaid by the present cannot lift itself to attain a glimpse of the future <\s>
<s> all which is comparatively inherent or can lay claim to any degree of permanence in the tyranny which the french nation maintains over europe rests upon two foundations first upon the despotic rule which has been established in france over a powerful people who have lately passed from a state of revolution in which they supported a struggle begun for domestic liberty and long continued for liberty and national independence and secondly upon the personal character of the man by whom that rule is exercised <\s>
<s> as to the former every one knows that despotism in a general sense is but another word for weakness <\s>
<s> let one generation disappear and a people over whom such rule has been extended if it have not virtue to free itself is condemned to embarrassment in the operations of its government and to perpetual languor with no better hope than that which may spring from the diseased activity of some particular prince on whom the authority may happen to devolve <\s>
<s> this if it takes a regular hereditary course but if the succession be interrupted and the supreme power frequently usurped or given by election worse evils follow <\s>
<s> science and art must dwindle whether the power be hereditary or not and the virtues of a trajan or an antonine are a hollow support for the feeling of contentment and happiness in the hearts of their subjects such virtues are even a painful mockery something that is and may vanish in a moment and leave the monstrous crimes of a caracalla or a domitian in its place men who are probably leaders of a long procession of their kind <\s>
<s> the feebleness of despotic power we have had before our eyes in the late condition of spain and prussia and in that of france before the revolution and in the present condition of austria and russia <\s>
<s> but in a new born arbitrary and military government especially if like that of france it have been immediately preceded by a popular constitution not only this weakness is not found but it possesses for the purposes of external annoyance a preternatural vigour <\s>
<s> many causes contribute to this we need only mention that fitness real or supposed being necessarily the chief and almost sole recommendation to offices of trust it is clear that such offices will in general be ably filled and their duties comparatively well executed and that from the conjunction of absolute civil and military authority in a single person there naturally follows promptness of decision concentration of effort rapidity of motion and confidence that the movements made will be regularly supported <\s>
<s> this is all which need now be said upon the subject of this first basis of french tyranny <\s>
<s> for the second namely the personal character of the chief i shall at present content myself with noting to prevent misconception that this basis is not laid in any superiority of talents in him but in his utter rejection of the restraints of morality in wickedness which acknowledges no limit but the extent of its own power <\s>
<s> let any one reflect a moment and he will feel that a new world of forces is opened to a being who has made this desperate leap <\s>
<s> it is a tremendous principle to be adopted and steadily adhered to by a man in the station which buonaparte occupies and he has taken the full benefit of it <\s>
<s> what there is in this principle of weak perilous and self destructive i may find a grateful employment in endeavouring to shew upon some future occasion <\s>
<s> but it is a duty which we owe to the present moment to proclaim in vindication of the dignity of human nature and for an admonition to men of prostrate spirit that the dominion which this enemy of mankind holds has neither been acquired nor is sustained by endowments of intellect which are rarely bestowed or by uncommon accumulations of knowledge but that it has risen from circumstances over which he had no influence circumstances which with the power they conferred have stimulated passions whose natural food hath been and is ignorance from the barbarian impotence and insolence of a mind originally of ordinary constitution lagging in moral sentiment and knowledge three hundred years behind the age in which it acts <\s>
<s> in such manner did the power originate and by the forces which i have described is it maintained <\s>
<s> this should be declared and it should be added that the crimes of buonaparte are more to be abhorred than those of other denaturalized creatures whose actions are painted in history because the author of those crimes is guilty with less temptation and sins in the presence of a clearer light <\s>
<s> no doubt in the command of almost the whole military force of europe the subject which called upon me to make these distinctions he has at this moment a third source of power which may be added to these two <\s>
<s> he himself rates this last so high either is or affects to be so persuaded of its pre eminence that he boldly announces to the world that it is madness and even impiety to resist him <\s>
<s> and sorry may we be to remember that there are british senators who if a judgement may be formed from the language which they speak are inclined to accompany him far in this opinion <\s>
<s> but the enormity of this power has in it nothing inherent or permanent <\s>
<s> two signal overthrows in pitched battles would i believe go far to destroy it <\s>
<s> germans dutch italians swiss poles would desert the army of buonaparte and flock to the standard of his adversaries from the moment they could look towards it with that confidence which one or two conspicuous victories would inspire <\s>
<s> a regiment of 900 swiss joined the british army in portugal and if the french had been compelled to surrender as prisoners of war we should have seen that all those troops who were not native frenchmen would if encouragement had been given have joined the british and the opportunity that was lost of demonstrating this fact was not among the least of the mischiefs which attended the termination of the campaign in a word the vastness of buonaparte's military power is formidable not because it is impossible to break it but because it has not yet been penetrated <\s>
<s> in this respect it may not inaptly be compared to a huge pine forest such as are found in the northern parts of this island whose ability to resist the storms is in its skirts let but the blast once make an inroad and it levels the forest and sweeps it away at pleasure <\s>
<s> a hundred thousand men such as fought at vimiera and corunna would accomplish three such victories as i have been anticipating <\s>
<s> this nation might command a military force which would drive the french out of the peninsula i do not say that we could sustain there a military force which would prevent their re entering but that we could transplant thither by a great effort one which would expel them this i maintain and it is matter of thought in which infirm minds may find both reproach and instruction <\s>
<s> the spaniards could then take possession of their own fortresses and have leisure to give themselves a blended civil and military organization complete and animated by liberty which if once accomplished they would be able to protect themselves <\s>
<s> the oppressed continental powers also seeing such unquestionable proof that great britain was sincere and earnest would lift their heads again and by so doing would lighten the burthen of war which might remain for the spaniards <\s>
<s> in treating of this plan i have presumed that a general might be placed at the head of this great military power who would not sign a treaty like that of the convention of cintra and say look at the proceedings of the board of inquiry that he was determined to this by british interests or frame any treaty in the country of an ally save one purely military for the honourable preservation if necessary of his own army or part of it to which the sole or even the main inducement was our interests contra distinguished from those of that ally a general and a ministry whose policy would be comprehensive enough to perceive that the true welfare of britain is best promoted by the independence freedom and honour of other nations and that it is only by the diffusion and prevalence of these virtues that french tyranny can be ultimately reduced or the influence of france over the rest of europe brought within its natural and reasonable limits <\s>
<s> if this attempt be above the strain and temper of the country there remains only a plan laid down upon the other principles namely service as far as is required in things rather than in men that is men being secondary to things <\s>
<s> it is not i fear possible that the moral sentiments of the british army or government should accord with those of spain in her present condition <\s>
<s> commanding power indeed as hath been said put forth in the repulse of the common enemy would tend more effectually than any thing save the prevalence of true wisdom to prevent disagreement and to obviate any temporary injury which the moral spirit of the spaniards might receive from us at all events such power should there ensue any injury would bring a solid compensation <\s>
<s> but from a middle course an association sufficiently intimate and wide to scatter every where unkindly passions and yet unable to attain the salutary point of decisive power no good is to be expected <\s>
<s> great would be the evil at this momentous period if the hatred of the spaniards should look two ways <\s>
<s> let it be as steadily fixed upon the french as the pilot's eye upon his mark <\s>
<s> military stores and arms should be furnished with unfailing liberality let troops also be supplied but let these act separately taking strong positions upon the coast if such can be found to employ twice their numbers of the enemy and above all let there be floating armies keeping the enemy in constant uncertainty where he is to be attacked <\s>
<s> the peninsula frame of spain and portugal lays that region open to the full shock of british warfare <\s>
<s> our fleet and army should act wherever it is possible as parts of one body a right hand and a left and the enemy ought to be made to feel the force of both <\s>
<s> but whatever plans be adopted there can be no success unless the execution be entrusted to generals of competent judgement <\s>
<s> that the british army swarms with those who are incompetent is too plain from successive proofs in the transactions at buenos ayres at cintra and in the result of the board of inquiry nor must we see a general appointed to command and required at the same time to frame his operations according to the opinion of an inferior officer an injunction for a recommendation from such a quarter amounts to an injunction implying that a man had been appointed to a high station of which the very persons who had appointed him deemed him unworthy else they must have known that he would endeavour to profit by the experience of any of his inferior officers from the suggestions of his own understanding at the same time by denying to the general in chief the free use of his own judgement and by the act of announcing this presumption of his incompetence to the man himself such an indignity is put upon him that his passions must of necessity be rouzed so as to leave it scarcely possible that he could draw any benefit which he might otherwise have drawn from the local knowledge or talents of the individual to whom he was referred and lastly this injunction virtually involves a subversion of all military subordination <\s>
<s> in the better times of the house of commons a minister who had presumed to write such a letter as that to which i allude would have been impeached <\s>
<s> the debates in parliament and measures of government every day furnish new proofs of the truths which i have been attempting to establish of the utter want of general principles new and lamentable proofs <\s>

<s> it is not therefore inordinate desire of wealth or power which is so injurious as the means which are and must be employed in the present intellectual condition of the legislature to sustain and secure that power these are at once an effect of barrenness and a cause acting and mutually re acting incessantly <\s>
<s> an enlightened friend has in conversation observed to the author of these pages that formerly the principles of men wore better than they who held them but that now a far worse evil men are better than their principles <\s>
<s> i believe it of the deplorable quality and state of principles the public proceedings in our country furnish daily new proof <\s>
<s> it is however some consolation at this present crisis to find that of the thoughts and feelings uttered during the two debates which led me to these painful declarations such as approach towards truth which has any dignity in it come from the side of his majesty's ministers but note again those contradictions to which i have so often been obliged to advert <\s>
<s> the ministers advise his majesty publicly to express sentiments of disapprobation upon the convention of cintra and when the question of the merits or demerits of this instrument comes before them in parliament the same persons who as advisers of the crown lately condemned the treaty now in their character of representatives of the people by the manner in which they received this motion have pronounced an encomium upon it <\s>
<s> for though as i have said the motion was inaccurately and inadequately worded it was not set aside upon this ground <\s>
<s> and the parliament has therefore persisted in withholding from the insulted and injured people and from their allies the only reparation which perhaps it may be in its power to grant has refused to signify its repentance and sorrow for what hath been done without which as a previous step there can be no proof no gratifying intimation even to this country or to its allies that the future efforts of the british parliament are in a sincere spirit <\s>
<s> the guilt of the transaction therefore being neither repented of nor atoned for the course of evil is by necessity persevered in but let us turn to a brighter region <\s>
<s> the events of the last year gloriously destroying many frail fears have placed in the rank of serene and immortal truths a proposition which as an object of belief hath in all ages been fondly cherished namely that a numerous nation determined to be free may effect its purpose in despite of the mightiest power which a foreign invader can bring against it <\s>
<s> these events also have pointed out how in the ways of nature and under the guidance of society this happy end is to be attained in other words they have shewn that the cause of the people in dangers and difficulties issuing from this quarter of oppression is safe while it remains not only in the bosom but in the hands of the people or what amounts to the same thing in those of a government which being truly from the people is faithfully for them <\s>
<s> while the power remained with the provincial juntas that is with the body natural of the community for those authorities newly generated in such adversity were truly living members of that body ); every thing prospered in spain <\s>
<s> hopes of the best kind were opened out and encouraged liberal opinions countenanced and wise measures arranged and last and except as proceeding from these least of all victories in the field in the streets of the city and upon the walls of the fortress <\s>
<s> i have heretofore styled it a blessing that the spanish people became their own masters at once <\s>
<s> it was a blessing but not without much alloy as the same disinterested generous passions which preserved and would for a season still have preserved them from a bad exercise of their power impelled them to part with it too soon before labours hitherto neither tried nor thought of had created throughout the country the minor excellences indispensible for the performance of those labours before powerful minds not hitherto of general note had found time to shew themselves and before men who were previously known had undergone the proof of new situations <\s>
<s> much therefore was wanting to direct the general judgement in the choice of persons when the second delegation took place which was a removal the first we have seen had not been so of the power from the people <\s>
<s> but when a common centre became absolutely necessary the power ought to have passed from the provincial assemblies into the hands of the cortes and into none else <\s>
<s> a pernicious oligarchy crept into the place of this comprehensive this constitutional this saving and majestic assembly <\s>
<s> far be it from me to speak of the supreme junta with ill advised condemnation every man must feel for the distressful trials to which that body has been exposed <\s>
<s> but eighty men or a hundred with a king at their head veiled under a cloud of fiction we might say with reference to the difficulties of this moment begotten upon a cloud of fiction could not be an image of a nation like that of spain or an adequate instrument of their power for their ends <\s>
<s> the assembly from the smallness of its numbers must have wanted breadth of wing to extend itself and brood over spain with a quickening touch of warmth every where <\s>
<s> if also as hath been mentioned there was a want of experience to determine the judgment in choice of persons this same smallness of numbers must have unnecessarily increased the evil by excluding many men of worth and talents which were so far known and allowed as that they would surely have been deputed to an assembly upon a larger scale <\s>
<s> gratitude habit and numerous other causes must have given an undue preponderance to birth station rank and fortune and have fixed the election more than was reasonable upon those who were most conspicuous for these distinctions men whose very virtue would incline them superstitiously to respect established things and to mistrust the people towards whom not only a frank confidence but a forward generosity was the first of duties <\s>
<s> i speak not of the vices to which such men would be liable brought up under the discipline of a government administered like the old monarchy of spain the matter is both ungracious and too obvious <\s>
<s> but i began with hope and hope has inwardly accompanied me to the end <\s>
<s> the whole course of the campaign rightly interpreted has justified my hope <\s>
<s> in madrid in ferrol in corunna in every considerable place and in every part of the country over which the french have re extended their dominion we learn from their own reports that the body of the people have shewed against them to the last the most determined hostility <\s>
<s> hence it is clear that the lure which the invading usurper found himself constrained lately to hold out to the inferior orders of society in the shape of various immunities has totally failed and therefore he turns for support to another quarter and now attempts to cajole the wealthy and the privileged <\s>
<s> but this class has been taught by late decrees what it has to expect from him and how far he is to be confided in for its especial interests <\s>
<s> many individuals no doubt he will seduce but the bulk of the class even if they could be insensible to more liberal feelings cannot but be his enemies <\s>
<s> this change therefore is not merely shifting ground but retiring to a position which he himself has previously undermined <\s>
<s> here is confusion and a power warring against itself <\s>
<s> so will it ever fare with foreign tyrants when in spite of domestic abuses a people which has lived long feels that it has a country to love and where the heart of that people is sound <\s>
<s> between the native inhabitants of france and spain there has existed from the earliest period and still does exist an universal and utter dissimilitude in laws actions deportment gait manners customs join with this the difference in the language and the barrier of the pyrenees a separation and an opposition in great things and an antipathy in small <\s>
<s> ignorant then must he be of history and of the reports of travellers and residents in the two countries or strangely inattentive to the constitution of human nature who this being true can admit the belief that the spaniards numerous and powerful as they are will live under frenchmen as their lords and masters <\s>
<s> let there be added to this inherent mutual repulsiveness those recent indignities and horrible outrages and we need not fear to say that such reconcilement is impossible even without that further insuperable obstacle which we hope will exist an establishment of a free constitution in spain the intoxicated setter up of kings may fill his diary with pompous stories of the acclamations with which his solemn puppets are received he may stuff their mouths with impious asseverations and hire knees to bend before them and lips to answer with honied greetings of gratitude and love these cannot remove the old heart and put a new one into the bosom of the spectators <\s>
<s> the whole is a pageant seen for a day among men in its passage to that limbo large and broad whither as to their proper home fleet all the unaccomplish'd works of nature's hand abortive monstrous or unkindly mix'd dissolv d on earth <\s>
<s> talk not of the perishable nature of enthusiasm and rise above a craving for perpetual manifestations of things <\s>
<s> he is to be pitied whose eye can only be pierced by the light of a meridian sun whose frame can only be warmed by the heat of midsummer <\s>
<s> let us hear no more of the little dependence to be had in war upon voluntary service <\s>
<s> the things with which we are primarily and mainly concerned are inward passions and not outward arrangements <\s>
<s> these latter may be given at any time when the parts to be put together are in readiness <\s>
<s> in the former instance year after year we imagined things to be what they were not and in this by a more fatal and more common delusion the thought of what things really are precludes the thought of what in a moment they may become the mind overlaid by the present cannot lift itself to attain a glimpse of the future <\s>
<s> all which is comparatively inherent or can lay claim to any degree of permanence in the tyranny which the french nation maintains over europe rests upon two foundations first upon the despotic rule which has been established in france over a powerful people who have lately passed from a state of revolution in which they supported a struggle begun for domestic liberty and long continued for liberty and national independence and secondly upon the personal character of the man by whom that rule is exercised <\s>
<s> as to the former every one knows that despotism in a general sense is but another word for weakness <\s>

<s> all which is comparatively inherent or can lay claim to any degree of permanence in the tyranny which the french nation maintains over europe rests upon two foundations first upon the despotic rule which has been established in france over a powerful people who have lately passed from a state of revolution in which they supported a struggle begun for domestic liberty and long continued for liberty and national independence and secondly upon the personal character of the man by whom that rule is exercised <\s>
<s> as to the former every one knows that despotism in a general sense is but another word for weakness <\s>
<s> let one generation disappear and a people over whom such rule has been extended if it have not virtue to free itself is condemned to embarrassment in the operations of its government and to perpetual languor with no better hope than that which may spring from the diseased activity of some particular prince on whom the authority may happen to devolve <\s>
<s> this if it takes a regular hereditary course but if the succession be interrupted and the supreme power frequently usurped or given by election worse evils follow <\s>

<s> the feebleness of despotic power we have had before our eyes in the late condition of spain and prussia and in that of france before the revolution and in the present condition of austria and russia <\s>
<s> but in a new born arbitrary and military government especially if like that of france it have been immediately preceded by a popular constitution not only this weakness is not found but it possesses for the purposes of external annoyance a preternatural vigour <\s>
<s> many causes contribute to this we need only mention that fitness real or supposed being necessarily the chief and almost sole recommendation to offices of trust it is clear that such offices will in general be ably filled and their duties comparatively well executed and that from the conjunction of absolute civil and military authority in a single person there naturally follows promptness of decision concentration of effort rapidity of motion and confidence that the movements made will be regularly supported <\s>
<s> this is all which need now be said upon the subject of this first basis of french tyranny <\s>
<s> for the second namely the personal character of the chief i shall at present content myself with noting to prevent misconception that this basis is not laid in any superiority of talents in him but in his utter rejection of the restraints of morality in wickedness which acknowledges no limit but the extent of its own power <\s>
<s> let any one reflect a moment and he will feel that a new world of forces is opened to a being who has made this desperate leap <\s>
<s> it is a tremendous principle to be adopted and steadily adhered to by a man in the station which buonaparte occupies and he has taken the full benefit of it <\s>
<s> what there is in this principle of weak perilous and self destructive i may find a grateful employment in endeavouring to shew upon some future occasion <\s>
<s> but it is a duty which we owe to the present moment to proclaim in vindication of the dignity of human nature and for an admonition to men of prostrate spirit that the dominion which this enemy of mankind holds has neither been acquired nor is sustained by endowments of intellect which are rarely bestowed or by uncommon accumulations of knowledge but that it has risen from circumstances over which he had no influence circumstances which with the power they conferred have stimulated passions whose natural food hath been and is ignorance from the barbarian impotence and insolence of a mind originally of ordinary constitution lagging in moral sentiment and knowledge three hundred years behind the age in which it acts <\s>
<s> in such manner did the power originate and by the forces which i have described is it maintained <\s>
<s> this should be declared and it should be added that the crimes of buonaparte are more to be abhorred than those of other denaturalized creatures whose actions are painted in history because the author of those crimes is guilty with less temptation and sins in the presence of a clearer light <\s>
<s> no doubt in the command of almost the whole military force of europe the subject which called upon me to make these distinctions he has at this moment a third source of power which may be added to these two <\s>
<s> he himself rates this last so high either is or affects to be so persuaded of its pre eminence that he boldly announces to the world that it is madness and even impiety to resist him <\s>
<s> and sorry may we be to remember that there are british senators who if a judgement may be formed from the language which they speak are inclined to accompany him far in this opinion <\s>
<s> but the enormity of this power has in it nothing inherent or permanent <\s>
<s> two signal overthrows in pitched battles would i believe go far to destroy it <\s>
<s> germans dutch italians swiss poles would desert the army of buonaparte and flock to the standard of his adversaries from the moment they could look towards it with that confidence which one or two conspicuous victories would inspire <\s>
<s> a regiment of 900 swiss joined the british army in portugal and if the french had been compelled to surrender as prisoners of war we should have seen that all those troops who were not native frenchmen would if encouragement had been given have joined the british and the opportunity that was lost of demonstrating this fact was not among the least of the mischiefs which attended the termination of the campaign in a word the vastness of buonaparte's military power is formidable not because it is impossible to break it but because it has not yet been penetrated <\s>
<s> in this respect it may not inaptly be compared to a huge pine forest such as are found in the northern parts of this island whose ability to resist the storms is in its skirts let but the blast once make an inroad and it levels the forest and sweeps it away at pleasure <\s>
<s> a hundred thousand men such as fought at vimiera and corunna would accomplish three such victories as i have been anticipating <\s>
<s> this nation might command a military force which would drive the french out of the peninsula i do not say that we could sustain there a military force which would prevent their re entering but that we could transplant thither by a great effort one which would expel them this i maintain and it is matter of thought in which infirm minds may find both reproach and instruction <\s>
<s> the spaniards could then take possession of their own fortresses and have leisure to give themselves a blended civil and military organization complete and animated by liberty which if once accomplished they would be able to protect themselves <\s>
<s> the oppressed continental powers also seeing such unquestionable proof that great britain was sincere and earnest would lift their heads again and by so doing would lighten the burthen of war which might remain for the spaniards <\s>
<s> in treating of this plan i have presumed that a general might be placed at the head of this great military power who would not sign a treaty like that of the convention of cintra and say look at the proceedings of the board of inquiry that he was determined to this by british interests or frame any treaty in the country of an ally save one purely military for the honourable preservation if necessary of his own army or part of it to which the sole or even the main inducement was our interests contra distinguished from those of that ally a general and a ministry whose policy would be comprehensive enough to perceive that the true welfare of britain is best promoted by the independence freedom and honour of other nations and that it is only by the diffusion and prevalence of these virtues that french tyranny can be ultimately reduced or the influence of france over the rest of europe brought within its natural and reasonable limits <\s>
<s> if this attempt be above the strain and temper of the country there remains only a plan laid down upon the other principles namely service as far as is required in things rather than in men that is men being secondary to things <\s>
<s> it is not i fear possible that the moral sentiments of the british army or government should accord with those of spain in her present condition <\s>
<s> commanding power indeed as hath been said put forth in the repulse of the common enemy would tend more effectually than any thing save the prevalence of true wisdom to prevent disagreement and to obviate any temporary injury which the moral spirit of the spaniards might receive from us at all events such power should there ensue any injury would bring a solid compensation <\s>
<s> but from a middle course an association sufficiently intimate and wide to scatter every where unkindly passions and yet unable to attain the salutary point of decisive power no good is to be expected <\s>
<s> great would be the evil at this momentous period if the hatred of the spaniards should look two ways <\s>
<s> let it be as steadily fixed upon the french as the pilot's eye upon his mark <\s>
<s> military stores and arms should be furnished with unfailing liberality let troops also be supplied but let these act separately taking strong positions upon the coast if such can be found to employ twice their numbers of the enemy and above all let there be floating armies keeping the enemy in constant uncertainty where he is to be attacked <\s>
<s> the peninsula frame of spain and portugal lays that region open to the full shock of british warfare <\s>
<s> our fleet and army should act wherever it is possible as parts of one body a right hand and a left and the enemy ought to be made to feel the force of both <\s>
<s> but whatever plans be adopted there can be no success unless the execution be entrusted to generals of competent judgement <\s>
<s> that the british army swarms with those who are incompetent is too plain from successive proofs in the transactions at buenos ayres at cintra and in the result of the board of inquiry nor must we see a general appointed to command and required at the same time to frame his operations according to the opinion of an inferior officer an injunction for a recommendation from such a quarter amounts to an injunction implying that a man had been appointed to a high station of which the very persons who had appointed him deemed him unworthy else they must have known that he would endeavour to profit by the experience of any of his inferior officers from the suggestions of his own understanding at the same time by denying to the general in chief the free use of his own judgement and by the act of announcing this presumption of his incompetence to the man himself such an indignity is put upon him that his passions must of necessity be rouzed so as to leave it scarcely possible that he could draw any benefit which he might otherwise have drawn from the local knowledge or talents of the individual to whom he was referred and lastly this injunction virtually involves a subversion of all military subordination <\s>
<s> in the better times of the house of commons a minister who had presumed to write such a letter as that to which i allude would have been impeached <\s>
<s> the debates in parliament and measures of government every day furnish new proofs of the truths which i have been attempting to establish of the utter want of general principles new and lamentable proofs <\s>
<s> this moment while i am drawing towards a conclusion i learn from the newspaper reports that the house of commons has refused to declare that the convention of centra disappointed the hopes and expectations of the nation <\s>
<s> the motion according to the letter of it was ill framed for the convention might have been a very good one and still have disappointed the hopes and expectations of the nation as those might have been unwise at all events the words ought to have stood the just and reasonable hopes of the nation <\s>
<s> but the hacknied phrase of disappointed hopes and expectations' should not have been used at all it is a centre round which much delusion has gathered <\s>
<s> the convention not only did not satisfy the nation's hopes of good but sunk it into a pitfall of unimagined and unimaginable evil <\s>
<s> the hearts and understandings of the people tell them that the language of a proposed parliamentary resolution upon this occasion ought not only to have been different in the letter but also widely different in the spirit and the reader of these pages will have deduced that no terms of reprobation could in severity exceed the offences involved in and connected with that instrument <\s>
<s> but while the grand keep of the castle of iniquity was to be stormed we have seen nothing but a puny assault upon heaps of the scattered rubbish of the fortress nay for the most part on some accidental mole hills at its base <\s>
<s> i do not speak thus in disrespect to the right hon <\s>
<s> gentleman who headed this attack <\s>
<s> his mind left to itself would i doubt not have prompted something worthier and higher but he moves in the phalanx of party a spiritual body in which by strange inconsistency the hampering weakening and destroying of every individual mind of which it is composed is the law which must constitute the strength of the whole <\s>
<s> the question was whether principles affecting the very existence of society had not been violated and an arm lifted and let fall which struck at the root of honour with the aggravation of the crime having been committed at this momentous period <\s>
<s> but what relation is there between these principles and actions and being in place or out of it <\s>
<s> if the people would constitutionally and resolutely assert their rights their representatives would be taught another lesson and for their own profit <\s>
<s> their understandings would be enriched accordingly for it is there there where least suspected that the want from which this country suffers chiefly lies <\s>
<s> they err who suppose that venality and corruption though now spreading more and more are the master evils of this day neither these nor immoderate craving for power are so much to be deprecated as the non existence of a widely ranging intellect of an intellect which if not efficacious to infuse truth as a vital fluid into the heart might at least make it a powerful tool in the hand <\s>
<s> outward profession which for practical purposes is an act of most desirable subservience would then wait upon those objects to which inward reverence though not felt was known to be due <\s>

<s> the ministers advise his majesty publicly to express sentiments of disapprobation upon the convention of cintra and when the question of the merits or demerits of this instrument comes before them in parliament the same persons who as advisers of the crown lately condemned the treaty now in their character of representatives of the people by the manner in which they received this motion have pronounced an encomium upon it <\s>
<s> for though as i have said the motion was inaccurately and inadequately worded it was not set aside upon this ground <\s>
<s> and the parliament has therefore persisted in withholding from the insulted and injured people and from their allies the only reparation which perhaps it may be in its power to grant has refused to signify its repentance and sorrow for what hath been done without which as a previous step there can be no proof no gratifying intimation even to this country or to its allies that the future efforts of the british parliament are in a sincere spirit <\s>
<s> the guilt of the transaction therefore being neither repented of nor atoned for the course of evil is by necessity persevered in but let us turn to a brighter region <\s>
<s> the events of the last year gloriously destroying many frail fears have placed in the rank of serene and immortal truths a proposition which as an object of belief hath in all ages been fondly cherished namely that a numerous nation determined to be free may effect its purpose in despite of the mightiest power which a foreign invader can bring against it <\s>
<s> these events also have pointed out how in the ways of nature and under the guidance of society this happy end is to be attained in other words they have shewn that the cause of the people in dangers and difficulties issuing from this quarter of oppression is safe while it remains not only in the bosom but in the hands of the people or what amounts to the same thing in those of a government which being truly from the people is faithfully for them <\s>
<s> while the power remained with the provincial juntas that is with the body natural of the community for those authorities newly generated in such adversity were truly living members of that body ); every thing prospered in spain <\s>
<s> hopes of the best kind were opened out and encouraged liberal opinions countenanced and wise measures arranged and last and except as proceeding from these least of all victories in the field in the streets of the city and upon the walls of the fortress <\s>
<s> i have heretofore styled it a blessing that the spanish people became their own masters at once <\s>
<s> it was a blessing but not without much alloy as the same disinterested generous passions which preserved and would for a season still have preserved them from a bad exercise of their power impelled them to part with it too soon before labours hitherto neither tried nor thought of had created throughout the country the minor excellences indispensible for the performance of those labours before powerful minds not hitherto of general note had found time to shew themselves and before men who were previously known had undergone the proof of new situations <\s>
<s> much therefore was wanting to direct the general judgement in the choice of persons when the second delegation took place which was a removal the first we have seen had not been so of the power from the people <\s>
<s> but when a common centre became absolutely necessary the power ought to have passed from the provincial assemblies into the hands of the cortes and into none else <\s>
<s> a pernicious oligarchy crept into the place of this comprehensive this constitutional this saving and majestic assembly <\s>
<s> far be it from me to speak of the supreme junta with ill advised condemnation every man must feel for the distressful trials to which that body has been exposed <\s>
<s> but eighty men or a hundred with a king at their head veiled under a cloud of fiction we might say with reference to the difficulties of this moment begotten upon a cloud of fiction could not be an image of a nation like that of spain or an adequate instrument of their power for their ends <\s>
<s> the assembly from the smallness of its numbers must have wanted breadth of wing to extend itself and brood over spain with a quickening touch of warmth every where <\s>
<s> if also as hath been mentioned there was a want of experience to determine the judgment in choice of persons this same smallness of numbers must have unnecessarily increased the evil by excluding many men of worth and talents which were so far known and allowed as that they would surely have been deputed to an assembly upon a larger scale <\s>
<s> gratitude habit and numerous other causes must have given an undue preponderance to birth station rank and fortune and have fixed the election more than was reasonable upon those who were most conspicuous for these distinctions men whose very virtue would incline them superstitiously to respect established things and to mistrust the people towards whom not only a frank confidence but a forward generosity was the first of duties <\s>
<s> i speak not of the vices to which such men would be liable brought up under the discipline of a government administered like the old monarchy of spain the matter is both ungracious and too obvious <\s>
<s> but i began with hope and hope has inwardly accompanied me to the end <\s>
<s> the whole course of the campaign rightly interpreted has justified my hope <\s>
<s> in madrid in ferrol in corunna in every considerable place and in every part of the country over which the french have re extended their dominion we learn from their own reports that the body of the people have shewed against them to the last the most determined hostility <\s>
<s> hence it is clear that the lure which the invading usurper found himself constrained lately to hold out to the inferior orders of society in the shape of various immunities has totally failed and therefore he turns for support to another quarter and now attempts to cajole the wealthy and the privileged <\s>
<s> but this class has been taught by late decrees what it has to expect from him and how far he is to be confided in for its especial interests <\s>
<s> many individuals no doubt he will seduce but the bulk of the class even if they could be insensible to more liberal feelings cannot but be his enemies <\s>
<s> this change therefore is not merely shifting ground but retiring to a position which he himself has previously undermined <\s>
<s> here is confusion and a power warring against itself <\s>
<s> so will it ever fare with foreign tyrants when in spite of domestic abuses a people which has lived long feels that it has a country to love and where the heart of that people is sound <\s>
<s> between the native inhabitants of france and spain there has existed from the earliest period and still does exist an universal and utter dissimilitude in laws actions deportment gait manners customs join with this the difference in the language and the barrier of the pyrenees a separation and an opposition in great things and an antipathy in small <\s>
<s> ignorant then must he be of history and of the reports of travellers and residents in the two countries or strangely inattentive to the constitution of human nature who this being true can admit the belief that the spaniards numerous and powerful as they are will live under frenchmen as their lords and masters <\s>
<s> let there be added to this inherent mutual repulsiveness those recent indignities and horrible outrages and we need not fear to say that such reconcilement is impossible even without that further insuperable obstacle which we hope will exist an establishment of a free constitution in spain the intoxicated setter up of kings may fill his diary with pompous stories of the acclamations with which his solemn puppets are received he may stuff their mouths with impious asseverations and hire knees to bend before them and lips to answer with honied greetings of gratitude and love these cannot remove the old heart and put a new one into the bosom of the spectators <\s>
<s> the whole is a pageant seen for a day among men in its passage to that limbo large and broad whither as to their proper home fleet all the unaccomplish'd works of nature's hand abortive monstrous or unkindly mix'd dissolv d on earth <\s>
<s> talk not of the perishable nature of enthusiasm and rise above a craving for perpetual manifestations of things <\s>
<s> he is to be pitied whose eye can only be pierced by the light of a meridian sun whose frame can only be warmed by the heat of midsummer <\s>
<s> let us hear no more of the little dependence to be had in war upon voluntary service <\s>
<s> the things with which we are primarily and mainly concerned are inward passions and not outward arrangements <\s>
<s> these latter may be given at any time when the parts to be put together are in readiness <\s>
<s> in the former instance year after year we imagined things to be what they were not and in this by a more fatal and more common delusion the thought of what things really are precludes the thought of what in a moment they may become the mind overlaid by the present cannot lift itself to attain a glimpse of the future <\s>
<s> all which is comparatively inherent or can lay claim to any degree of permanence in the tyranny which the french nation maintains over europe rests upon two foundations first upon the despotic rule which has been established in france over a powerful people who have lately passed from a state of revolution in which they supported a struggle begun for domestic liberty and long continued for liberty and national independence and secondly upon the personal character of the man by whom that rule is exercised <\s>
<s> as to the former every one knows that despotism in a general sense is but another word for weakness <\s>
<s> let one generation disappear and a people over whom such rule has been extended if it have not virtue to free itself is condemned to embarrassment in the operations of its government and to perpetual languor with no better hope than that which may spring from the diseased activity of some particular prince on whom the authority may happen to devolve <\s>
<s> this if it takes a regular hereditary course but if the succession be interrupted and the supreme power frequently usurped or given by election worse evils follow <\s>
<s> science and art must dwindle whether the power be hereditary or not and the virtues of a trajan or an antonine are a hollow support for the feeling of contentment and happiness in the hearts of their subjects such virtues are even a painful mockery something that is and may vanish in a moment and leave the monstrous crimes of a caracalla or a domitian in its place men who are probably leaders of a long procession of their kind <\s>
<s> the feebleness of despotic power we have had before our eyes in the late condition of spain and prussia and in that of france before the revolution and in the present condition of austria and russia <\s>
<s> but in a new born arbitrary and military government especially if like that of france it have been immediately preceded by a popular constitution not only this weakness is not found but it possesses for the purposes of external annoyance a preternatural vigour <\s>
<s> many causes contribute to this we need only mention that fitness real or supposed being necessarily the chief and almost sole recommendation to offices of trust it is clear that such offices will in general be ably filled and their duties comparatively well executed and that from the conjunction of absolute civil and military authority in a single person there naturally follows promptness of decision concentration of effort rapidity of motion and confidence that the movements made will be regularly supported <\s>
<s> this is all which need now be said upon the subject of this first basis of french tyranny <\s>
<s> for the second namely the personal character of the chief i shall at present content myself with noting to prevent misconception that this basis is not laid in any superiority of talents in him but in his utter rejection of the restraints of morality in wickedness which acknowledges no limit but the extent of its own power <\s>
<s> let any one reflect a moment and he will feel that a new world of forces is opened to a being who has made this desperate leap <\s>
<s> it is a tremendous principle to be adopted and steadily adhered to by a man in the station which buonaparte occupies and he has taken the full benefit of it <\s>
<s> what there is in this principle of weak perilous and self destructive i may find a grateful employment in endeavouring to shew upon some future occasion <\s>
<s> but it is a duty which we owe to the present moment to proclaim in vindication of the dignity of human nature and for an admonition to men of prostrate spirit that the dominion which this enemy of mankind holds has neither been acquired nor is sustained by endowments of intellect which are rarely bestowed or by uncommon accumulations of knowledge but that it has risen from circumstances over which he had no influence circumstances which with the power they conferred have stimulated passions whose natural food hath been and is ignorance from the barbarian impotence and insolence of a mind originally of ordinary constitution lagging in moral sentiment and knowledge three hundred years behind the age in which it acts <\s>

<s> for the second namely the personal character of the chief i shall at present content myself with noting to prevent misconception that this basis is not laid in any superiority of talents in him but in his utter rejection of the restraints of morality in wickedness which acknowledges no limit but the extent of its own power <\s>

<s> what there is in this principle of weak perilous and self destructive i may find a grateful employment in endeavouring to shew upon some future occasion <\s>
<s> but it is a duty which we owe to the present moment to proclaim in vindication of the dignity of human nature and for an admonition to men of prostrate spirit that the dominion which this enemy of mankind holds has neither been acquired nor is sustained by endowments of intellect which are rarely bestowed or by uncommon accumulations of knowledge but that it has risen from circumstances over which he had no influence circumstances which with the power they conferred have stimulated passions whose natural food hath been and is ignorance from the barbarian impotence and insolence of a mind originally of ordinary constitution lagging in moral sentiment and knowledge three hundred years behind the age in which it acts <\s>
<s> in such manner did the power originate and by the forces which i have described is it maintained <\s>
<s> this should be declared and it should be added that the crimes of buonaparte are more to be abhorred than those of other denaturalized creatures whose actions are painted in history because the author of those crimes is guilty with less temptation and sins in the presence of a clearer light <\s>
<s> no doubt in the command of almost the whole military force of europe the subject which called upon me to make these distinctions he has at this moment a third source of power which may be added to these two <\s>
<s> he himself rates this last so high either is or affects to be so persuaded of its pre eminence that he boldly announces to the world that it is madness and even impiety to resist him <\s>
<s> and sorry may we be to remember that there are british senators who if a judgement may be formed from the language which they speak are inclined to accompany him far in this opinion <\s>
<s> but the enormity of this power has in it nothing inherent or permanent <\s>
<s> two signal overthrows in pitched battles would i believe go far to destroy it <\s>
<s> germans dutch italians swiss poles would desert the army of buonaparte and flock to the standard of his adversaries from the moment they could look towards it with that confidence which one or two conspicuous victories would inspire <\s>
<s> a regiment of 900 swiss joined the british army in portugal and if the french had been compelled to surrender as prisoners of war we should have seen that all those troops who were not native frenchmen would if encouragement had been given have joined the british and the opportunity that was lost of demonstrating this fact was not among the least of the mischiefs which attended the termination of the campaign in a word the vastness of buonaparte's military power is formidable not because it is impossible to break it but because it has not yet been penetrated <\s>
<s> in this respect it may not inaptly be compared to a huge pine forest such as are found in the northern parts of this island whose ability to resist the storms is in its skirts let but the blast once make an inroad and it levels the forest and sweeps it away at pleasure <\s>
<s> a hundred thousand men such as fought at vimiera and corunna would accomplish three such victories as i have been anticipating <\s>
<s> this nation might command a military force which would drive the french out of the peninsula i do not say that we could sustain there a military force which would prevent their re entering but that we could transplant thither by a great effort one which would expel them this i maintain and it is matter of thought in which infirm minds may find both reproach and instruction <\s>
<s> the spaniards could then take possession of their own fortresses and have leisure to give themselves a blended civil and military organization complete and animated by liberty which if once accomplished they would be able to protect themselves <\s>
<s> the oppressed continental powers also seeing such unquestionable proof that great britain was sincere and earnest would lift their heads again and by so doing would lighten the burthen of war which might remain for the spaniards <\s>
<s> in treating of this plan i have presumed that a general might be placed at the head of this great military power who would not sign a treaty like that of the convention of cintra and say look at the proceedings of the board of inquiry that he was determined to this by british interests or frame any treaty in the country of an ally save one purely military for the honourable preservation if necessary of his own army or part of it to which the sole or even the main inducement was our interests contra distinguished from those of that ally a general and a ministry whose policy would be comprehensive enough to perceive that the true welfare of britain is best promoted by the independence freedom and honour of other nations and that it is only by the diffusion and prevalence of these virtues that french tyranny can be ultimately reduced or the influence of france over the rest of europe brought within its natural and reasonable limits <\s>
<s> if this attempt be above the strain and temper of the country there remains only a plan laid down upon the other principles namely service as far as is required in things rather than in men that is men being secondary to things <\s>
<s> it is not i fear possible that the moral sentiments of the british army or government should accord with those of spain in her present condition <\s>
<s> commanding power indeed as hath been said put forth in the repulse of the common enemy would tend more effectually than any thing save the prevalence of true wisdom to prevent disagreement and to obviate any temporary injury which the moral spirit of the spaniards might receive from us at all events such power should there ensue any injury would bring a solid compensation <\s>
<s> but from a middle course an association sufficiently intimate and wide to scatter every where unkindly passions and yet unable to attain the salutary point of decisive power no good is to be expected <\s>
<s> great would be the evil at this momentous period if the hatred of the spaniards should look two ways <\s>
<s> let it be as steadily fixed upon the french as the pilot's eye upon his mark <\s>
<s> military stores and arms should be furnished with unfailing liberality let troops also be supplied but let these act separately taking strong positions upon the coast if such can be found to employ twice their numbers of the enemy and above all let there be floating armies keeping the enemy in constant uncertainty where he is to be attacked <\s>
<s> the peninsula frame of spain and portugal lays that region open to the full shock of british warfare <\s>
<s> our fleet and army should act wherever it is possible as parts of one body a right hand and a left and the enemy ought to be made to feel the force of both <\s>
<s> but whatever plans be adopted there can be no success unless the execution be entrusted to generals of competent judgement <\s>
<s> that the british army swarms with those who are incompetent is too plain from successive proofs in the transactions at buenos ayres at cintra and in the result of the board of inquiry nor must we see a general appointed to command and required at the same time to frame his operations according to the opinion of an inferior officer an injunction for a recommendation from such a quarter amounts to an injunction implying that a man had been appointed to a high station of which the very persons who had appointed him deemed him unworthy else they must have known that he would endeavour to profit by the experience of any of his inferior officers from the suggestions of his own understanding at the same time by denying to the general in chief the free use of his own judgement and by the act of announcing this presumption of his incompetence to the man himself such an indignity is put upon him that his passions must of necessity be rouzed so as to leave it scarcely possible that he could draw any benefit which he might otherwise have drawn from the local knowledge or talents of the individual to whom he was referred and lastly this injunction virtually involves a subversion of all military subordination <\s>
<s> in the better times of the house of commons a minister who had presumed to write such a letter as that to which i allude would have been impeached <\s>
<s> the debates in parliament and measures of government every day furnish new proofs of the truths which i have been attempting to establish of the utter want of general principles new and lamentable proofs <\s>
<s> this moment while i am drawing towards a conclusion i learn from the newspaper reports that the house of commons has refused to declare that the convention of centra disappointed the hopes and expectations of the nation <\s>
<s> the motion according to the letter of it was ill framed for the convention might have been a very good one and still have disappointed the hopes and expectations of the nation as those might have been unwise at all events the words ought to have stood the just and reasonable hopes of the nation <\s>
<s> but the hacknied phrase of disappointed hopes and expectations' should not have been used at all it is a centre round which much delusion has gathered <\s>
<s> the convention not only did not satisfy the nation's hopes of good but sunk it into a pitfall of unimagined and unimaginable evil <\s>
<s> the hearts and understandings of the people tell them that the language of a proposed parliamentary resolution upon this occasion ought not only to have been different in the letter but also widely different in the spirit and the reader of these pages will have deduced that no terms of reprobation could in severity exceed the offences involved in and connected with that instrument <\s>
<s> but while the grand keep of the castle of iniquity was to be stormed we have seen nothing but a puny assault upon heaps of the scattered rubbish of the fortress nay for the most part on some accidental mole hills at its base <\s>
<s> i do not speak thus in disrespect to the right hon <\s>
<s> gentleman who headed this attack <\s>
<s> his mind left to itself would i doubt not have prompted something worthier and higher but he moves in the phalanx of party a spiritual body in which by strange inconsistency the hampering weakening and destroying of every individual mind of which it is composed is the law which must constitute the strength of the whole <\s>
<s> the question was whether principles affecting the very existence of society had not been violated and an arm lifted and let fall which struck at the root of honour with the aggravation of the crime having been committed at this momentous period <\s>
<s> but what relation is there between these principles and actions and being in place or out of it <\s>
<s> if the people would constitutionally and resolutely assert their rights their representatives would be taught another lesson and for their own profit <\s>
<s> their understandings would be enriched accordingly for it is there there where least suspected that the want from which this country suffers chiefly lies <\s>
<s> they err who suppose that venality and corruption though now spreading more and more are the master evils of this day neither these nor immoderate craving for power are so much to be deprecated as the non existence of a widely ranging intellect of an intellect which if not efficacious to infuse truth as a vital fluid into the heart might at least make it a powerful tool in the hand <\s>
<s> outward profession which for practical purposes is an act of most desirable subservience would then wait upon those objects to which inward reverence though not felt was known to be due <\s>
<s> schemes of ample reach and true benefit would also promise best to insure the rewards coveted by personal ambition and men of baser passions finding it their interest would naturally combine to perform useful service under the direction of strong minds while men of good intentions would have their own pure satisfaction and would exert themselves with more upright i mean more hopeful cheerfulness and more successfully <\s>
<s> it is not therefore inordinate desire of wealth or power which is so injurious as the means which are and must be employed in the present intellectual condition of the legislature to sustain and secure that power these are at once an effect of barrenness and a cause acting and mutually re acting incessantly <\s>
<s> an enlightened friend has in conversation observed to the author of these pages that formerly the principles of men wore better than they who held them but that now a far worse evil men are better than their principles <\s>
<s> i believe it of the deplorable quality and state of principles the public proceedings in our country furnish daily new proof <\s>
<s> it is however some consolation at this present crisis to find that of the thoughts and feelings uttered during the two debates which led me to these painful declarations such as approach towards truth which has any dignity in it come from the side of his majesty's ministers but note again those contradictions to which i have so often been obliged to advert <\s>
<s> the ministers advise his majesty publicly to express sentiments of disapprobation upon the convention of cintra and when the question of the merits or demerits of this instrument comes before them in parliament the same persons who as advisers of the crown lately condemned the treaty now in their character of representatives of the people by the manner in which they received this motion have pronounced an encomium upon it <\s>
<s> for though as i have said the motion was inaccurately and inadequately worded it was not set aside upon this ground <\s>
<s> and the parliament has therefore persisted in withholding from the insulted and injured people and from their allies the only reparation which perhaps it may be in its power to grant has refused to signify its repentance and sorrow for what hath been done without which as a previous step there can be no proof no gratifying intimation even to this country or to its allies that the future efforts of the british parliament are in a sincere spirit <\s>
<s> the guilt of the transaction therefore being neither repented of nor atoned for the course of evil is by necessity persevered in but let us turn to a brighter region <\s>

<s> the ministers advise his majesty publicly to express sentiments of disapprobation upon the convention of cintra and when the question of the merits or demerits of this instrument comes before them in parliament the same persons who as advisers of the crown lately condemned the treaty now in their character of representatives of the people by the manner in which they received this motion have pronounced an encomium upon it <\s>
<s> for though as i have said the motion was inaccurately and inadequately worded it was not set aside upon this ground <\s>

<s> the guilt of the transaction therefore being neither repented of nor atoned for the course of evil is by necessity persevered in but let us turn to a brighter region <\s>
<s> the events of the last year gloriously destroying many frail fears have placed in the rank of serene and immortal truths a proposition which as an object of belief hath in all ages been fondly cherished namely that a numerous nation determined to be free may effect its purpose in despite of the mightiest power which a foreign invader can bring against it <\s>
<s> these events also have pointed out how in the ways of nature and under the guidance of society this happy end is to be attained in other words they have shewn that the cause of the people in dangers and difficulties issuing from this quarter of oppression is safe while it remains not only in the bosom but in the hands of the people or what amounts to the same thing in those of a government which being truly from the people is faithfully for them <\s>
<s> while the power remained with the provincial juntas that is with the body natural of the community for those authorities newly generated in such adversity were truly living members of that body ); every thing prospered in spain <\s>

<s> much therefore was wanting to direct the general judgement in the choice of persons when the second delegation took place which was a removal the first we have seen had not been so of the power from the people <\s>

<s> if also as hath been mentioned there was a want of experience to determine the judgment in choice of persons this same smallness of numbers must have unnecessarily increased the evil by excluding many men of worth and talents which were so far known and allowed as that they would surely have been deputed to an assembly upon a larger scale <\s>
<s> gratitude habit and numerous other causes must have given an undue preponderance to birth station rank and fortune and have fixed the election more than was reasonable upon those who were most conspicuous for these distinctions men whose very virtue would incline them superstitiously to respect established things and to mistrust the people towards whom not only a frank confidence but a forward generosity was the first of duties <\s>
<s> i speak not of the vices to which such men would be liable brought up under the discipline of a government administered like the old monarchy of spain the matter is both ungracious and too obvious <\s>

<s> the whole course of the campaign rightly interpreted has justified my hope <\s>
<s> in madrid in ferrol in corunna in every considerable place and in every part of the country over which the french have re extended their dominion we learn from their own reports that the body of the people have shewed against them to the last the most determined hostility <\s>
<s> hence it is clear that the lure which the invading usurper found himself constrained lately to hold out to the inferior orders of society in the shape of various immunities has totally failed and therefore he turns for support to another quarter and now attempts to cajole the wealthy and the privileged <\s>
<s> but this class has been taught by late decrees what it has to expect from him and how far he is to be confided in for its especial interests <\s>
<s> many individuals no doubt he will seduce but the bulk of the class even if they could be insensible to more liberal feelings cannot but be his enemies <\s>
<s> this change therefore is not merely shifting ground but retiring to a position which he himself has previously undermined <\s>
<s> here is confusion and a power warring against itself <\s>
<s> so will it ever fare with foreign tyrants when in spite of domestic abuses a people which has lived long feels that it has a country to love and where the heart of that people is sound <\s>
<s> between the native inhabitants of france and spain there has existed from the earliest period and still does exist an universal and utter dissimilitude in laws actions deportment gait manners customs join with this the difference in the language and the barrier of the pyrenees a separation and an opposition in great things and an antipathy in small <\s>
<s> ignorant then must he be of history and of the reports of travellers and residents in the two countries or strangely inattentive to the constitution of human nature who this being true can admit the belief that the spaniards numerous and powerful as they are will live under frenchmen as their lords and masters <\s>
<s> let there be added to this inherent mutual repulsiveness those recent indignities and horrible outrages and we need not fear to say that such reconcilement is impossible even without that further insuperable obstacle which we hope will exist an establishment of a free constitution in spain the intoxicated setter up of kings may fill his diary with pompous stories of the acclamations with which his solemn puppets are received he may stuff their mouths with impious asseverations and hire knees to bend before them and lips to answer with honied greetings of gratitude and love these cannot remove the old heart and put a new one into the bosom of the spectators <\s>
<s> the whole is a pageant seen for a day among men in its passage to that limbo large and broad whither as to their proper home fleet all the unaccomplish'd works of nature's hand abortive monstrous or unkindly mix'd dissolv d on earth <\s>

<s> he is to be pitied whose eye can only be pierced by the light of a meridian sun whose frame can only be warmed by the heat of midsummer <\s>
<s> let us hear no more of the little dependence to be had in war upon voluntary service <\s>
<s> the things with which we are primarily and mainly concerned are inward passions and not outward arrangements <\s>
<s> these latter may be given at any time when the parts to be put together are in readiness <\s>
<s> in the former instance year after year we imagined things to be what they were not and in this by a more fatal and more common delusion the thought of what things really are precludes the thought of what in a moment they may become the mind overlaid by the present cannot lift itself to attain a glimpse of the future <\s>
<s> all which is comparatively inherent or can lay claim to any degree of permanence in the tyranny which the french nation maintains over europe rests upon two foundations first upon the despotic rule which has been established in france over a powerful people who have lately passed from a state of revolution in which they supported a struggle begun for domestic liberty and long continued for liberty and national independence and secondly upon the personal character of the man by whom that rule is exercised <\s>
<s> as to the former every one knows that despotism in a general sense is but another word for weakness <\s>
<s> let one generation disappear and a people over whom such rule has been extended if it have not virtue to free itself is condemned to embarrassment in the operations of its government and to perpetual languor with no better hope than that which may spring from the diseased activity of some particular prince on whom the authority may happen to devolve <\s>
<s> this if it takes a regular hereditary course but if the succession be interrupted and the supreme power frequently usurped or given by election worse evils follow <\s>
<s> science and art must dwindle whether the power be hereditary or not and the virtues of a trajan or an antonine are a hollow support for the feeling of contentment and happiness in the hearts of their subjects such virtues are even a painful mockery something that is and may vanish in a moment and leave the monstrous crimes of a caracalla or a domitian in its place men who are probably leaders of a long procession of their kind <\s>
<s> the feebleness of despotic power we have had before our eyes in the late condition of spain and prussia and in that of france before the revolution and in the present condition of austria and russia <\s>
<s> but in a new born arbitrary and military government especially if like that of france it have been immediately preceded by a popular constitution not only this weakness is not found but it possesses for the purposes of external annoyance a preternatural vigour <\s>
<s> many causes contribute to this we need only mention that fitness real or supposed being necessarily the chief and almost sole recommendation to offices of trust it is clear that such offices will in general be ably filled and their duties comparatively well executed and that from the conjunction of absolute civil and military authority in a single person there naturally follows promptness of decision concentration of effort rapidity of motion and confidence that the movements made will be regularly supported <\s>
<s> this is all which need now be said upon the subject of this first basis of french tyranny <\s>
<s> for the second namely the personal character of the chief i shall at present content myself with noting to prevent misconception that this basis is not laid in any superiority of talents in him but in his utter rejection of the restraints of morality in wickedness which acknowledges no limit but the extent of its own power <\s>
<s> let any one reflect a moment and he will feel that a new world of forces is opened to a being who has made this desperate leap <\s>
<s> it is a tremendous principle to be adopted and steadily adhered to by a man in the station which buonaparte occupies and he has taken the full benefit of it <\s>
<s> what there is in this principle of weak perilous and self destructive i may find a grateful employment in endeavouring to shew upon some future occasion <\s>
<s> but it is a duty which we owe to the present moment to proclaim in vindication of the dignity of human nature and for an admonition to men of prostrate spirit that the dominion which this enemy of mankind holds has neither been acquired nor is sustained by endowments of intellect which are rarely bestowed or by uncommon accumulations of knowledge but that it has risen from circumstances over which he had no influence circumstances which with the power they conferred have stimulated passions whose natural food hath been and is ignorance from the barbarian impotence and insolence of a mind originally of ordinary constitution lagging in moral sentiment and knowledge three hundred years behind the age in which it acts <\s>
<s> in such manner did the power originate and by the forces which i have described is it maintained <\s>
<s> this should be declared and it should be added that the crimes of buonaparte are more to be abhorred than those of other denaturalized creatures whose actions are painted in history because the author of those crimes is guilty with less temptation and sins in the presence of a clearer light <\s>
<s> no doubt in the command of almost the whole military force of europe the subject which called upon me to make these distinctions he has at this moment a third source of power which may be added to these two <\s>
<s> he himself rates this last so high either is or affects to be so persuaded of its pre eminence that he boldly announces to the world that it is madness and even impiety to resist him <\s>
<s> and sorry may we be to remember that there are british senators who if a judgement may be formed from the language which they speak are inclined to accompany him far in this opinion <\s>
<s> but the enormity of this power has in it nothing inherent or permanent <\s>
<s> two signal overthrows in pitched battles would i believe go far to destroy it <\s>
<s> germans dutch italians swiss poles would desert the army of buonaparte and flock to the standard of his adversaries from the moment they could look towards it with that confidence which one or two conspicuous victories would inspire <\s>
<s> a regiment of 900 swiss joined the british army in portugal and if the french had been compelled to surrender as prisoners of war we should have seen that all those troops who were not native frenchmen would if encouragement had been given have joined the british and the opportunity that was lost of demonstrating this fact was not among the least of the mischiefs which attended the termination of the campaign in a word the vastness of buonaparte's military power is formidable not because it is impossible to break it but because it has not yet been penetrated <\s>
<s> in this respect it may not inaptly be compared to a huge pine forest such as are found in the northern parts of this island whose ability to resist the storms is in its skirts let but the blast once make an inroad and it levels the forest and sweeps it away at pleasure <\s>

<s> the oppressed continental powers also seeing such unquestionable proof that great britain was sincere and earnest would lift their heads again and by so doing would lighten the burthen of war which might remain for the spaniards <\s>

<s> let it be as steadily fixed upon the french as the pilot's eye upon his mark <\s>
<s> military stores and arms should be furnished with unfailing liberality let troops also be supplied but let these act separately taking strong positions upon the coast if such can be found to employ twice their numbers of the enemy and above all let there be floating armies keeping the enemy in constant uncertainty where he is to be attacked <\s>
<s> the peninsula frame of spain and portugal lays that region open to the full shock of british warfare <\s>
<s> our fleet and army should act wherever it is possible as parts of one body a right hand and a left and the enemy ought to be made to feel the force of both <\s>
<s> but whatever plans be adopted there can be no success unless the execution be entrusted to generals of competent judgement <\s>
<s> that the british army swarms with those who are incompetent is too plain from successive proofs in the transactions at buenos ayres at cintra and in the result of the board of inquiry nor must we see a general appointed to command and required at the same time to frame his operations according to the opinion of an inferior officer an injunction for a recommendation from such a quarter amounts to an injunction implying that a man had been appointed to a high station of which the very persons who had appointed him deemed him unworthy else they must have known that he would endeavour to profit by the experience of any of his inferior officers from the suggestions of his own understanding at the same time by denying to the general in chief the free use of his own judgement and by the act of announcing this presumption of his incompetence to the man himself such an indignity is put upon him that his passions must of necessity be rouzed so as to leave it scarcely possible that he could draw any benefit which he might otherwise have drawn from the local knowledge or talents of the individual to whom he was referred and lastly this injunction virtually involves a subversion of all military subordination <\s>
<s> in the better times of the house of commons a minister who had presumed to write such a letter as that to which i allude would have been impeached <\s>

<s> this moment while i am drawing towards a conclusion i learn from the newspaper reports that the house of commons has refused to declare that the convention of centra disappointed the hopes and expectations of the nation <\s>
<s> the motion according to the letter of it was ill framed for the convention might have been a very good one and still have disappointed the hopes and expectations of the nation as those might have been unwise at all events the words ought to have stood the just and reasonable hopes of the nation <\s>
<s> but the hacknied phrase of disappointed hopes and expectations' should not have been used at all it is a centre round which much delusion has gathered <\s>
<s> the convention not only did not satisfy the nation's hopes of good but sunk it into a pitfall of unimagined and unimaginable evil <\s>
<s> the hearts and understandings of the people tell them that the language of a proposed parliamentary resolution upon this occasion ought not only to have been different in the letter but also widely different in the spirit and the reader of these pages will have deduced that no terms of reprobation could in severity exceed the offences involved in and connected with that instrument <\s>
<s> but while the grand keep of the castle of iniquity was to be stormed we have seen nothing but a puny assault upon heaps of the scattered rubbish of the fortress nay for the most part on some accidental mole hills at its base <\s>
<s> i do not speak thus in disrespect to the right hon <\s>
<s> gentleman who headed this attack <\s>
<s> his mind left to itself would i doubt not have prompted something worthier and higher but he moves in the phalanx of party a spiritual body in which by strange inconsistency the hampering weakening and destroying of every individual mind of which it is composed is the law which must constitute the strength of the whole <\s>
<s> the question was whether principles affecting the very existence of society had not been violated and an arm lifted and let fall which struck at the root of honour with the aggravation of the crime having been committed at this momentous period <\s>
<s> but what relation is there between these principles and actions and being in place or out of it <\s>
<s> if the people would constitutionally and resolutely assert their rights their representatives would be taught another lesson and for their own profit <\s>
<s> their understandings would be enriched accordingly for it is there there where least suspected that the want from which this country suffers chiefly lies <\s>
<s> they err who suppose that venality and corruption though now spreading more and more are the master evils of this day neither these nor immoderate craving for power are so much to be deprecated as the non existence of a widely ranging intellect of an intellect which if not efficacious to infuse truth as a vital fluid into the heart might at least make it a powerful tool in the hand <\s>
<s> outward profession which for practical purposes is an act of most desirable subservience would then wait upon those objects to which inward reverence though not felt was known to be due <\s>
<s> schemes of ample reach and true benefit would also promise best to insure the rewards coveted by personal ambition and men of baser passions finding it their interest would naturally combine to perform useful service under the direction of strong minds while men of good intentions would have their own pure satisfaction and would exert themselves with more upright i mean more hopeful cheerfulness and more successfully <\s>
<s> it is not therefore inordinate desire of wealth or power which is so injurious as the means which are and must be employed in the present intellectual condition of the legislature to sustain and secure that power these are at once an effect of barrenness and a cause acting and mutually re acting incessantly <\s>
<s> an enlightened friend has in conversation observed to the author of these pages that formerly the principles of men wore better than they who held them but that now a far worse evil men are better than their principles <\s>
<s> i believe it of the deplorable quality and state of principles the public proceedings in our country furnish daily new proof <\s>
<s> it is however some consolation at this present crisis to find that of the thoughts and feelings uttered during the two debates which led me to these painful declarations such as approach towards truth which has any dignity in it come from the side of his majesty's ministers but note again those contradictions to which i have so often been obliged to advert <\s>
<s> the ministers advise his majesty publicly to express sentiments of disapprobation upon the convention of cintra and when the question of the merits or demerits of this instrument comes before them in parliament the same persons who as advisers of the crown lately condemned the treaty now in their character of representatives of the people by the manner in which they received this motion have pronounced an encomium upon it <\s>
<s> for though as i have said the motion was inaccurately and inadequately worded it was not set aside upon this ground <\s>
<s> and the parliament has therefore persisted in withholding from the insulted and injured people and from their allies the only reparation which perhaps it may be in its power to grant has refused to signify its repentance and sorrow for what hath been done without which as a previous step there can be no proof no gratifying intimation even to this country or to its allies that the future efforts of the british parliament are in a sincere spirit <\s>
<s> the guilt of the transaction therefore being neither repented of nor atoned for the course of evil is by necessity persevered in but let us turn to a brighter region <\s>
<s> the events of the last year gloriously destroying many frail fears have placed in the rank of serene and immortal truths a proposition which as an object of belief hath in all ages been fondly cherished namely that a numerous nation determined to be free may effect its purpose in despite of the mightiest power which a foreign invader can bring against it <\s>
<s> these events also have pointed out how in the ways of nature and under the guidance of society this happy end is to be attained in other words they have shewn that the cause of the people in dangers and difficulties issuing from this quarter of oppression is safe while it remains not only in the bosom but in the hands of the people or what amounts to the same thing in those of a government which being truly from the people is faithfully for them <\s>
<s> while the power remained with the provincial juntas that is with the body natural of the community for those authorities newly generated in such adversity were truly living members of that body ); every thing prospered in spain <\s>
<s> hopes of the best kind were opened out and encouraged liberal opinions countenanced and wise measures arranged and last and except as proceeding from these least of all victories in the field in the streets of the city and upon the walls of the fortress <\s>
<s> i have heretofore styled it a blessing that the spanish people became their own masters at once <\s>
<s> it was a blessing but not without much alloy as the same disinterested generous passions which preserved and would for a season still have preserved them from a bad exercise of their power impelled them to part with it too soon before labours hitherto neither tried nor thought of had created throughout the country the minor excellences indispensible for the performance of those labours before powerful minds not hitherto of general note had found time to shew themselves and before men who were previously known had undergone the proof of new situations <\s>
<s> much therefore was wanting to direct the general judgement in the choice of persons when the second delegation took place which was a removal the first we have seen had not been so of the power from the people <\s>
<s> but when a common centre became absolutely necessary the power ought to have passed from the provincial assemblies into the hands of the cortes and into none else <\s>
<s> a pernicious oligarchy crept into the place of this comprehensive this constitutional this saving and majestic assembly <\s>
<s> far be it from me to speak of the supreme junta with ill advised condemnation every man must feel for the distressful trials to which that body has been exposed <\s>
<s> but eighty men or a hundred with a king at their head veiled under a cloud of fiction we might say with reference to the difficulties of this moment begotten upon a cloud of fiction could not be an image of a nation like that of spain or an adequate instrument of their power for their ends <\s>
<s> the assembly from the smallness of its numbers must have wanted breadth of wing to extend itself and brood over spain with a quickening touch of warmth every where <\s>
<s> if also as hath been mentioned there was a want of experience to determine the judgment in choice of persons this same smallness of numbers must have unnecessarily increased the evil by excluding many men of worth and talents which were so far known and allowed as that they would surely have been deputed to an assembly upon a larger scale <\s>

<s> these events also have pointed out how in the ways of nature and under the guidance of society this happy end is to be attained in other words they have shewn that the cause of the people in dangers and difficulties issuing from this quarter of oppression is safe while it remains not only in the bosom but in the hands of the people or what amounts to the same thing in those of a government which being truly from the people is faithfully for them <\s>

<s> in the former instance year after year we imagined things to be what they were not and in this by a more fatal and more common delusion the thought of what things really are precludes the thought of what in a moment they may become the mind overlaid by the present cannot lift itself to attain a glimpse of the future <\s>
<s> all which is comparatively inherent or can lay claim to any degree of permanence in the tyranny which the french nation maintains over europe rests upon two foundations first upon the despotic rule which has been established in france over a powerful people who have lately passed from a state of revolution in which they supported a struggle begun for domestic liberty and long continued for liberty and national independence and secondly upon the personal character of the man by whom that rule is exercised <\s>
<s> as to the former every one knows that despotism in a general sense is but another word for weakness <\s>
<s> let one generation disappear and a people over whom such rule has been extended if it have not virtue to free itself is condemned to embarrassment in the operations of its government and to perpetual languor with no better hope than that which may spring from the diseased activity of some particular prince on whom the authority may happen to devolve <\s>
<s> this if it takes a regular hereditary course but if the succession be interrupted and the supreme power frequently usurped or given by election worse evils follow <\s>
<s> science and art must dwindle whether the power be hereditary or not and the virtues of a trajan or an antonine are a hollow support for the feeling of contentment and happiness in the hearts of their subjects such virtues are even a painful mockery something that is and may vanish in a moment and leave the monstrous crimes of a caracalla or a domitian in its place men who are probably leaders of a long procession of their kind <\s>
<s> the feebleness of despotic power we have had before our eyes in the late condition of spain and prussia and in that of france before the revolution and in the present condition of austria and russia <\s>
<s> but in a new born arbitrary and military government especially if like that of france it have been immediately preceded by a popular constitution not only this weakness is not found but it possesses for the purposes of external annoyance a preternatural vigour <\s>
<s> many causes contribute to this we need only mention that fitness real or supposed being necessarily the chief and almost sole recommendation to offices of trust it is clear that such offices will in general be ably filled and their duties comparatively well executed and that from the conjunction of absolute civil and military authority in a single person there naturally follows promptness of decision concentration of effort rapidity of motion and confidence that the movements made will be regularly supported <\s>
<s> this is all which need now be said upon the subject of this first basis of french tyranny <\s>
<s> for the second namely the personal character of the chief i shall at present content myself with noting to prevent misconception that this basis is not laid in any superiority of talents in him but in his utter rejection of the restraints of morality in wickedness which acknowledges no limit but the extent of its own power <\s>
<s> let any one reflect a moment and he will feel that a new world of forces is opened to a being who has made this desperate leap <\s>
<s> it is a tremendous principle to be adopted and steadily adhered to by a man in the station which buonaparte occupies and he has taken the full benefit of it <\s>
<s> what there is in this principle of weak perilous and self destructive i may find a grateful employment in endeavouring to shew upon some future occasion <\s>
<s> but it is a duty which we owe to the present moment to proclaim in vindication of the dignity of human nature and for an admonition to men of prostrate spirit that the dominion which this enemy of mankind holds has neither been acquired nor is sustained by endowments of intellect which are rarely bestowed or by uncommon accumulations of knowledge but that it has risen from circumstances over which he had no influence circumstances which with the power they conferred have stimulated passions whose natural food hath been and is ignorance from the barbarian impotence and insolence of a mind originally of ordinary constitution lagging in moral sentiment and knowledge three hundred years behind the age in which it acts <\s>
<s> in such manner did the power originate and by the forces which i have described is it maintained <\s>
<s> this should be declared and it should be added that the crimes of buonaparte are more to be abhorred than those of other denaturalized creatures whose actions are painted in history because the author of those crimes is guilty with less temptation and sins in the presence of a clearer light <\s>
<s> no doubt in the command of almost the whole military force of europe the subject which called upon me to make these distinctions he has at this moment a third source of power which may be added to these two <\s>
<s> he himself rates this last so high either is or affects to be so persuaded of its pre eminence that he boldly announces to the world that it is madness and even impiety to resist him <\s>
<s> and sorry may we be to remember that there are british senators who if a judgement may be formed from the language which they speak are inclined to accompany him far in this opinion <\s>
<s> but the enormity of this power has in it nothing inherent or permanent <\s>
<s> two signal overthrows in pitched battles would i believe go far to destroy it <\s>
<s> germans dutch italians swiss poles would desert the army of buonaparte and flock to the standard of his adversaries from the moment they could look towards it with that confidence which one or two conspicuous victories would inspire <\s>
<s> a regiment of 900 swiss joined the british army in portugal and if the french had been compelled to surrender as prisoners of war we should have seen that all those troops who were not native frenchmen would if encouragement had been given have joined the british and the opportunity that was lost of demonstrating this fact was not among the least of the mischiefs which attended the termination of the campaign in a word the vastness of buonaparte's military power is formidable not because it is impossible to break it but because it has not yet been penetrated <\s>
<s> in this respect it may not inaptly be compared to a huge pine forest such as are found in the northern parts of this island whose ability to resist the storms is in its skirts let but the blast once make an inroad and it levels the forest and sweeps it away at pleasure <\s>
<s> a hundred thousand men such as fought at vimiera and corunna would accomplish three such victories as i have been anticipating <\s>
<s> this nation might command a military force which would drive the french out of the peninsula i do not say that we could sustain there a military force which would prevent their re entering but that we could transplant thither by a great effort one which would expel them this i maintain and it is matter of thought in which infirm minds may find both reproach and instruction <\s>
<s> the spaniards could then take possession of their own fortresses and have leisure to give themselves a blended civil and military organization complete and animated by liberty which if once accomplished they would be able to protect themselves <\s>
<s> the oppressed continental powers also seeing such unquestionable proof that great britain was sincere and earnest would lift their heads again and by so doing would lighten the burthen of war which might remain for the spaniards <\s>
<s> in treating of this plan i have presumed that a general might be placed at the head of this great military power who would not sign a treaty like that of the convention of cintra and say look at the proceedings of the board of inquiry that he was determined to this by british interests or frame any treaty in the country of an ally save one purely military for the honourable preservation if necessary of his own army or part of it to which the sole or even the main inducement was our interests contra distinguished from those of that ally a general and a ministry whose policy would be comprehensive enough to perceive that the true welfare of britain is best promoted by the independence freedom and honour of other nations and that it is only by the diffusion and prevalence of these virtues that french tyranny can be ultimately reduced or the influence of france over the rest of europe brought within its natural and reasonable limits <\s>
<s> if this attempt be above the strain and temper of the country there remains only a plan laid down upon the other principles namely service as far as is required in things rather than in men that is men being secondary to things <\s>
<s> it is not i fear possible that the moral sentiments of the british army or government should accord with those of spain in her present condition <\s>
<s> commanding power indeed as hath been said put forth in the repulse of the common enemy would tend more effectually than any thing save the prevalence of true wisdom to prevent disagreement and to obviate any temporary injury which the moral spirit of the spaniards might receive from us at all events such power should there ensue any injury would bring a solid compensation <\s>
<s> but from a middle course an association sufficiently intimate and wide to scatter every where unkindly passions and yet unable to attain the salutary point of decisive power no good is to be expected <\s>
<s> great would be the evil at this momentous period if the hatred of the spaniards should look two ways <\s>
<s> let it be as steadily fixed upon the french as the pilot's eye upon his mark <\s>
<s> military stores and arms should be furnished with unfailing liberality let troops also be supplied but let these act separately taking strong positions upon the coast if such can be found to employ twice their numbers of the enemy and above all let there be floating armies keeping the enemy in constant uncertainty where he is to be attacked <\s>

<s> this moment while i am drawing towards a conclusion i learn from the newspaper reports that the house of commons has refused to declare that the convention of centra disappointed the hopes and expectations of the nation <\s>

<s> but the hacknied phrase of disappointed hopes and expectations' should not have been used at all it is a centre round which much delusion has gathered <\s>
<s> the convention not only did not satisfy the nation's hopes of good but sunk it into a pitfall of unimagined and unimaginable evil <\s>
<s> the hearts and understandings of the people tell them that the language of a proposed parliamentary resolution upon this occasion ought not only to have been different in the letter but also widely different in the spirit and the reader of these pages will have deduced that no terms of reprobation could in severity exceed the offences involved in and connected with that instrument <\s>
<s> but while the grand keep of the castle of iniquity was to be stormed we have seen nothing but a puny assault upon heaps of the scattered rubbish of the fortress nay for the most part on some accidental mole hills at its base <\s>

<s> his mind left to itself would i doubt not have prompted something worthier and higher but he moves in the phalanx of party a spiritual body in which by strange inconsistency the hampering weakening and destroying of every individual mind of which it is composed is the law which must constitute the strength of the whole <\s>
<s> the question was whether principles affecting the very existence of society had not been violated and an arm lifted and let fall which struck at the root of honour with the aggravation of the crime having been committed at this momentous period <\s>
<s> but what relation is there between these principles and actions and being in place or out of it <\s>
<s> if the people would constitutionally and resolutely assert their rights their representatives would be taught another lesson and for their own profit <\s>
<s> their understandings would be enriched accordingly for it is there there where least suspected that the want from which this country suffers chiefly lies <\s>
<s> they err who suppose that venality and corruption though now spreading more and more are the master evils of this day neither these nor immoderate craving for power are so much to be deprecated as the non existence of a widely ranging intellect of an intellect which if not efficacious to infuse truth as a vital fluid into the heart might at least make it a powerful tool in the hand <\s>
<s> outward profession which for practical purposes is an act of most desirable subservience would then wait upon those objects to which inward reverence though not felt was known to be due <\s>
<s> schemes of ample reach and true benefit would also promise best to insure the rewards coveted by personal ambition and men of baser passions finding it their interest would naturally combine to perform useful service under the direction of strong minds while men of good intentions would have their own pure satisfaction and would exert themselves with more upright i mean more hopeful cheerfulness and more successfully <\s>
<s> it is not therefore inordinate desire of wealth or power which is so injurious as the means which are and must be employed in the present intellectual condition of the legislature to sustain and secure that power these are at once an effect of barrenness and a cause acting and mutually re acting incessantly <\s>
<s> an enlightened friend has in conversation observed to the author of these pages that formerly the principles of men wore better than they who held them but that now a far worse evil men are better than their principles <\s>
<s> i believe it of the deplorable quality and state of principles the public proceedings in our country furnish daily new proof <\s>
<s> it is however some consolation at this present crisis to find that of the thoughts and feelings uttered during the two debates which led me to these painful declarations such as approach towards truth which has any dignity in it come from the side of his majesty's ministers but note again those contradictions to which i have so often been obliged to advert <\s>
<s> the ministers advise his majesty publicly to express sentiments of disapprobation upon the convention of cintra and when the question of the merits or demerits of this instrument comes before them in parliament the same persons who as advisers of the crown lately condemned the treaty now in their character of representatives of the people by the manner in which they received this motion have pronounced an encomium upon it <\s>
<s> for though as i have said the motion was inaccurately and inadequately worded it was not set aside upon this ground <\s>
<s> and the parliament has therefore persisted in withholding from the insulted and injured people and from their allies the only reparation which perhaps it may be in its power to grant has refused to signify its repentance and sorrow for what hath been done without which as a previous step there can be no proof no gratifying intimation even to this country or to its allies that the future efforts of the british parliament are in a sincere spirit <\s>
<s> the guilt of the transaction therefore being neither repented of nor atoned for the course of evil is by necessity persevered in but let us turn to a brighter region <\s>
<s> the events of the last year gloriously destroying many frail fears have placed in the rank of serene and immortal truths a proposition which as an object of belief hath in all ages been fondly cherished namely that a numerous nation determined to be free may effect its purpose in despite of the mightiest power which a foreign invader can bring against it <\s>
<s> these events also have pointed out how in the ways of nature and under the guidance of society this happy end is to be attained in other words they have shewn that the cause of the people in dangers and difficulties issuing from this quarter of oppression is safe while it remains not only in the bosom but in the hands of the people or what amounts to the same thing in those of a government which being truly from the people is faithfully for them <\s>
<s> while the power remained with the provincial juntas that is with the body natural of the community for those authorities newly generated in such adversity were truly living members of that body ); every thing prospered in spain <\s>
<s> hopes of the best kind were opened out and encouraged liberal opinions countenanced and wise measures arranged and last and except as proceeding from these least of all victories in the field in the streets of the city and upon the walls of the fortress <\s>
<s> i have heretofore styled it a blessing that the spanish people became their own masters at once <\s>
<s> it was a blessing but not without much alloy as the same disinterested generous passions which preserved and would for a season still have preserved them from a bad exercise of their power impelled them to part with it too soon before labours hitherto neither tried nor thought of had created throughout the country the minor excellences indispensible for the performance of those labours before powerful minds not hitherto of general note had found time to shew themselves and before men who were previously known had undergone the proof of new situations <\s>
<s> much therefore was wanting to direct the general judgement in the choice of persons when the second delegation took place which was a removal the first we have seen had not been so of the power from the people <\s>
<s> but when a common centre became absolutely necessary the power ought to have passed from the provincial assemblies into the hands of the cortes and into none else <\s>
<s> a pernicious oligarchy crept into the place of this comprehensive this constitutional this saving and majestic assembly <\s>
<s> far be it from me to speak of the supreme junta with ill advised condemnation every man must feel for the distressful trials to which that body has been exposed <\s>
<s> but eighty men or a hundred with a king at their head veiled under a cloud of fiction we might say with reference to the difficulties of this moment begotten upon a cloud of fiction could not be an image of a nation like that of spain or an adequate instrument of their power for their ends <\s>
<s> the assembly from the smallness of its numbers must have wanted breadth of wing to extend itself and brood over spain with a quickening touch of warmth every where <\s>
<s> if also as hath been mentioned there was a want of experience to determine the judgment in choice of persons this same smallness of numbers must have unnecessarily increased the evil by excluding many men of worth and talents which were so far known and allowed as that they would surely have been deputed to an assembly upon a larger scale <\s>
<s> gratitude habit and numerous other causes must have given an undue preponderance to birth station rank and fortune and have fixed the election more than was reasonable upon those who were most conspicuous for these distinctions men whose very virtue would incline them superstitiously to respect established things and to mistrust the people towards whom not only a frank confidence but a forward generosity was the first of duties <\s>
<s> i speak not of the vices to which such men would be liable brought up under the discipline of a government administered like the old monarchy of spain the matter is both ungracious and too obvious <\s>
<s> but i began with hope and hope has inwardly accompanied me to the end <\s>
<s> the whole course of the campaign rightly interpreted has justified my hope <\s>
<s> in madrid in ferrol in corunna in every considerable place and in every part of the country over which the french have re extended their dominion we learn from their own reports that the body of the people have shewed against them to the last the most determined hostility <\s>
<s> hence it is clear that the lure which the invading usurper found himself constrained lately to hold out to the inferior orders of society in the shape of various immunities has totally failed and therefore he turns for support to another quarter and now attempts to cajole the wealthy and the privileged <\s>
<s> but this class has been taught by late decrees what it has to expect from him and how far he is to be confided in for its especial interests <\s>
<s> many individuals no doubt he will seduce but the bulk of the class even if they could be insensible to more liberal feelings cannot but be his enemies <\s>
<s> this change therefore is not merely shifting ground but retiring to a position which he himself has previously undermined <\s>
<s> here is confusion and a power warring against itself <\s>
<s> so will it ever fare with foreign tyrants when in spite of domestic abuses a people which has lived long feels that it has a country to love and where the heart of that people is sound <\s>
<s> between the native inhabitants of france and spain there has existed from the earliest period and still does exist an universal and utter dissimilitude in laws actions deportment gait manners customs join with this the difference in the language and the barrier of the pyrenees a separation and an opposition in great things and an antipathy in small <\s>

<s> the hearts and understandings of the people tell them that the language of a proposed parliamentary resolution upon this occasion ought not only to have been different in the letter but also widely different in the spirit and the reader of these pages will have deduced that no terms of reprobation could in severity exceed the offences involved in and connected with that instrument <\s>
<s> but while the grand keep of the castle of iniquity was to be stormed we have seen nothing but a puny assault upon heaps of the scattered rubbish of the fortress nay for the most part on some accidental mole hills at its base <\s>

<s> it is not therefore inordinate desire of wealth or power which is so injurious as the means which are and must be employed in the present intellectual condition of the legislature to sustain and secure that power these are at once an effect of barrenness and a cause acting and mutually re acting incessantly <\s>

<s> i believe it of the deplorable quality and state of principles the public proceedings in our country furnish daily new proof <\s>
<s> it is however some consolation at this present crisis to find that of the thoughts and feelings uttered during the two debates which led me to these painful declarations such as approach towards truth which has any dignity in it come from the side of his majesty's ministers but note again those contradictions to which i have so often been obliged to advert <\s>
<s> the ministers advise his majesty publicly to express sentiments of disapprobation upon the convention of cintra and when the question of the merits or demerits of this instrument comes before them in parliament the same persons who as advisers of the crown lately condemned the treaty now in their character of representatives of the people by the manner in which they received this motion have pronounced an encomium upon it <\s>
<s> for though as i have said the motion was inaccurately and inadequately worded it was not set aside upon this ground <\s>

<s> the guilt of the transaction therefore being neither repented of nor atoned for the course of evil is by necessity persevered in but let us turn to a brighter region <\s>
<s> the events of the last year gloriously destroying many frail fears have placed in the rank of serene and immortal truths a proposition which as an object of belief hath in all ages been fondly cherished namely that a numerous nation determined to be free may effect its purpose in despite of the mightiest power which a foreign invader can bring against it <\s>
<s> these events also have pointed out how in the ways of nature and under the guidance of society this happy end is to be attained in other words they have shewn that the cause of the people in dangers and difficulties issuing from this quarter of oppression is safe while it remains not only in the bosom but in the hands of the people or what amounts to the same thing in those of a government which being truly from the people is faithfully for them <\s>
<s> while the power remained with the provincial juntas that is with the body natural of the community for those authorities newly generated in such adversity were truly living members of that body ); every thing prospered in spain <\s>
<s> hopes of the best kind were opened out and encouraged liberal opinions countenanced and wise measures arranged and last and except as proceeding from these least of all victories in the field in the streets of the city and upon the walls of the fortress <\s>

<s> it was a blessing but not without much alloy as the same disinterested generous passions which preserved and would for a season still have preserved them from a bad exercise of their power impelled them to part with it too soon before labours hitherto neither tried nor thought of had created throughout the country the minor excellences indispensible for the performance of those labours before powerful minds not hitherto of general note had found time to shew themselves and before men who were previously known had undergone the proof of new situations <\s>
<s> much therefore was wanting to direct the general judgement in the choice of persons when the second delegation took place which was a removal the first we have seen had not been so of the power from the people <\s>

<s> if also as hath been mentioned there was a want of experience to determine the judgment in choice of persons this same smallness of numbers must have unnecessarily increased the evil by excluding many men of worth and talents which were so far known and allowed as that they would surely have been deputed to an assembly upon a larger scale <\s>
<s> gratitude habit and numerous other causes must have given an undue preponderance to birth station rank and fortune and have fixed the election more than was reasonable upon those who were most conspicuous for these distinctions men whose very virtue would incline them superstitiously to respect established things and to mistrust the people towards whom not only a frank confidence but a forward generosity was the first of duties <\s>
<s> i speak not of the vices to which such men would be liable brought up under the discipline of a government administered like the old monarchy of spain the matter is both ungracious and too obvious <\s>
<s> but i began with hope and hope has inwardly accompanied me to the end <\s>
<s> the whole course of the campaign rightly interpreted has justified my hope <\s>
<s> in madrid in ferrol in corunna in every considerable place and in every part of the country over which the french have re extended their dominion we learn from their own reports that the body of the people have shewed against them to the last the most determined hostility <\s>
<s> hence it is clear that the lure which the invading usurper found himself constrained lately to hold out to the inferior orders of society in the shape of various immunities has totally failed and therefore he turns for support to another quarter and now attempts to cajole the wealthy and the privileged <\s>

<s> so will it ever fare with foreign tyrants when in spite of domestic abuses a people which has lived long feels that it has a country to love and where the heart of that people is sound <\s>

<s> let there be added to this inherent mutual repulsiveness those recent indignities and horrible outrages and we need not fear to say that such reconcilement is impossible even without that further insuperable obstacle which we hope will exist an establishment of a free constitution in spain the intoxicated setter up of kings may fill his diary with pompous stories of the acclamations with which his solemn puppets are received he may stuff their mouths with impious asseverations and hire knees to bend before them and lips to answer with honied greetings of gratitude and love these cannot remove the old heart and put a new one into the bosom of the spectators <\s>
<s> the whole is a pageant seen for a day among men in its passage to that limbo large and broad whither as to their proper home fleet all the unaccomplish'd works of nature's hand abortive monstrous or unkindly mix'd dissolv d on earth <\s>

<s> he is to be pitied whose eye can only be pierced by the light of a meridian sun whose frame can only be warmed by the heat of midsummer <\s>
<s> let us hear no more of the little dependence to be had in war upon voluntary service <\s>
<s> the things with which we are primarily and mainly concerned are inward passions and not outward arrangements <\s>
<s> these latter may be given at any time when the parts to be put together are in readiness <\s>
<s> in the former instance year after year we imagined things to be what they were not and in this by a more fatal and more common delusion the thought of what things really are precludes the thought of what in a moment they may become the mind overlaid by the present cannot lift itself to attain a glimpse of the future <\s>
<s> all which is comparatively inherent or can lay claim to any degree of permanence in the tyranny which the french nation maintains over europe rests upon two foundations first upon the despotic rule which has been established in france over a powerful people who have lately passed from a state of revolution in which they supported a struggle begun for domestic liberty and long continued for liberty and national independence and secondly upon the personal character of the man by whom that rule is exercised <\s>
<s> as to the former every one knows that despotism in a general sense is but another word for weakness <\s>
<s> let one generation disappear and a people over whom such rule has been extended if it have not virtue to free itself is condemned to embarrassment in the operations of its government and to perpetual languor with no better hope than that which may spring from the diseased activity of some particular prince on whom the authority may happen to devolve <\s>
<s> this if it takes a regular hereditary course but if the succession be interrupted and the supreme power frequently usurped or given by election worse evils follow <\s>
<s> science and art must dwindle whether the power be hereditary or not and the virtues of a trajan or an antonine are a hollow support for the feeling of contentment and happiness in the hearts of their subjects such virtues are even a painful mockery something that is and may vanish in a moment and leave the monstrous crimes of a caracalla or a domitian in its place men who are probably leaders of a long procession of their kind <\s>
<s> the feebleness of despotic power we have had before our eyes in the late condition of spain and prussia and in that of france before the revolution and in the present condition of austria and russia <\s>
<s> but in a new born arbitrary and military government especially if like that of france it have been immediately preceded by a popular constitution not only this weakness is not found but it possesses for the purposes of external annoyance a preternatural vigour <\s>
<s> many causes contribute to this we need only mention that fitness real or supposed being necessarily the chief and almost sole recommendation to offices of trust it is clear that such offices will in general be ably filled and their duties comparatively well executed and that from the conjunction of absolute civil and military authority in a single person there naturally follows promptness of decision concentration of effort rapidity of motion and confidence that the movements made will be regularly supported <\s>
<s> this is all which need now be said upon the subject of this first basis of french tyranny <\s>
<s> for the second namely the personal character of the chief i shall at present content myself with noting to prevent misconception that this basis is not laid in any superiority of talents in him but in his utter rejection of the restraints of morality in wickedness which acknowledges no limit but the extent of its own power <\s>
<s> let any one reflect a moment and he will feel that a new world of forces is opened to a being who has made this desperate leap <\s>
<s> it is a tremendous principle to be adopted and steadily adhered to by a man in the station which buonaparte occupies and he has taken the full benefit of it <\s>
<s> what there is in this principle of weak perilous and self destructive i may find a grateful employment in endeavouring to shew upon some future occasion <\s>
<s> but it is a duty which we owe to the present moment to proclaim in vindication of the dignity of human nature and for an admonition to men of prostrate spirit that the dominion which this enemy of mankind holds has neither been acquired nor is sustained by endowments of intellect which are rarely bestowed or by uncommon accumulations of knowledge but that it has risen from circumstances over which he had no influence circumstances which with the power they conferred have stimulated passions whose natural food hath been and is ignorance from the barbarian impotence and insolence of a mind originally of ordinary constitution lagging in moral sentiment and knowledge three hundred years behind the age in which it acts <\s>
<s> in such manner did the power originate and by the forces which i have described is it maintained <\s>
<s> this should be declared and it should be added that the crimes of buonaparte are more to be abhorred than those of other denaturalized creatures whose actions are painted in history because the author of those crimes is guilty with less temptation and sins in the presence of a clearer light <\s>
<s> no doubt in the command of almost the whole military force of europe the subject which called upon me to make these distinctions he has at this moment a third source of power which may be added to these two <\s>
<s> he himself rates this last so high either is or affects to be so persuaded of its pre eminence that he boldly announces to the world that it is madness and even impiety to resist him <\s>
<s> and sorry may we be to remember that there are british senators who if a judgement may be formed from the language which they speak are inclined to accompany him far in this opinion <\s>
<s> but the enormity of this power has in it nothing inherent or permanent <\s>
<s> two signal overthrows in pitched battles would i believe go far to destroy it <\s>
<s> germans dutch italians swiss poles would desert the army of buonaparte and flock to the standard of his adversaries from the moment they could look towards it with that confidence which one or two conspicuous victories would inspire <\s>
<s> a regiment of 900 swiss joined the british army in portugal and if the french had been compelled to surrender as prisoners of war we should have seen that all those troops who were not native frenchmen would if encouragement had been given have joined the british and the opportunity that was lost of demonstrating this fact was not among the least of the mischiefs which attended the termination of the campaign in a word the vastness of buonaparte's military power is formidable not because it is impossible to break it but because it has not yet been penetrated <\s>
<s> in this respect it may not inaptly be compared to a huge pine forest such as are found in the northern parts of this island whose ability to resist the storms is in its skirts let but the blast once make an inroad and it levels the forest and sweeps it away at pleasure <\s>
<s> a hundred thousand men such as fought at vimiera and corunna would accomplish three such victories as i have been anticipating <\s>
<s> this nation might command a military force which would drive the french out of the peninsula i do not say that we could sustain there a military force which would prevent their re entering but that we could transplant thither by a great effort one which would expel them this i maintain and it is matter of thought in which infirm minds may find both reproach and instruction <\s>
<s> the spaniards could then take possession of their own fortresses and have leisure to give themselves a blended civil and military organization complete and animated by liberty which if once accomplished they would be able to protect themselves <\s>
<s> the oppressed continental powers also seeing such unquestionable proof that great britain was sincere and earnest would lift their heads again and by so doing would lighten the burthen of war which might remain for the spaniards <\s>
<s> in treating of this plan i have presumed that a general might be placed at the head of this great military power who would not sign a treaty like that of the convention of cintra and say look at the proceedings of the board of inquiry that he was determined to this by british interests or frame any treaty in the country of an ally save one purely military for the honourable preservation if necessary of his own army or part of it to which the sole or even the main inducement was our interests contra distinguished from those of that ally a general and a ministry whose policy would be comprehensive enough to perceive that the true welfare of britain is best promoted by the independence freedom and honour of other nations and that it is only by the diffusion and prevalence of these virtues that french tyranny can be ultimately reduced or the influence of france over the rest of europe brought within its natural and reasonable limits <\s>
<s> if this attempt be above the strain and temper of the country there remains only a plan laid down upon the other principles namely service as far as is required in things rather than in men that is men being secondary to things <\s>
<s> it is not i fear possible that the moral sentiments of the british army or government should accord with those of spain in her present condition <\s>
<s> commanding power indeed as hath been said put forth in the repulse of the common enemy would tend more effectually than any thing save the prevalence of true wisdom to prevent disagreement and to obviate any temporary injury which the moral spirit of the spaniards might receive from us at all events such power should there ensue any injury would bring a solid compensation <\s>
<s> but from a middle course an association sufficiently intimate and wide to scatter every where unkindly passions and yet unable to attain the salutary point of decisive power no good is to be expected <\s>
<s> great would be the evil at this momentous period if the hatred of the spaniards should look two ways <\s>
<s> let it be as steadily fixed upon the french as the pilot's eye upon his mark <\s>
<s> military stores and arms should be furnished with unfailing liberality let troops also be supplied but let these act separately taking strong positions upon the coast if such can be found to employ twice their numbers of the enemy and above all let there be floating armies keeping the enemy in constant uncertainty where he is to be attacked <\s>
<s> the peninsula frame of spain and portugal lays that region open to the full shock of british warfare <\s>
<s> our fleet and army should act wherever it is possible as parts of one body a right hand and a left and the enemy ought to be made to feel the force of both <\s>
<s> but whatever plans be adopted there can be no success unless the execution be entrusted to generals of competent judgement <\s>
<s> that the british army swarms with those who are incompetent is too plain from successive proofs in the transactions at buenos ayres at cintra and in the result of the board of inquiry nor must we see a general appointed to command and required at the same time to frame his operations according to the opinion of an inferior officer an injunction for a recommendation from such a quarter amounts to an injunction implying that a man had been appointed to a high station of which the very persons who had appointed him deemed him unworthy else they must have known that he would endeavour to profit by the experience of any of his inferior officers from the suggestions of his own understanding at the same time by denying to the general in chief the free use of his own judgement and by the act of announcing this presumption of his incompetence to the man himself such an indignity is put upon him that his passions must of necessity be rouzed so as to leave it scarcely possible that he could draw any benefit which he might otherwise have drawn from the local knowledge or talents of the individual to whom he was referred and lastly this injunction virtually involves a subversion of all military subordination <\s>
<s> in the better times of the house of commons a minister who had presumed to write such a letter as that to which i allude would have been impeached <\s>
<s> the debates in parliament and measures of government every day furnish new proofs of the truths which i have been attempting to establish of the utter want of general principles new and lamentable proofs <\s>

<s> it is not therefore inordinate desire of wealth or power which is so injurious as the means which are and must be employed in the present intellectual condition of the legislature to sustain and secure that power these are at once an effect of barrenness and a cause acting and mutually re acting incessantly <\s>
<s> an enlightened friend has in conversation observed to the author of these pages that formerly the principles of men wore better than they who held them but that now a far worse evil men are better than their principles <\s>
<s> i believe it of the deplorable quality and state of principles the public proceedings in our country furnish daily new proof <\s>
<s> it is however some consolation at this present crisis to find that of the thoughts and feelings uttered during the two debates which led me to these painful declarations such as approach towards truth which has any dignity in it come from the side of his majesty's ministers but note again those contradictions to which i have so often been obliged to advert <\s>
<s> the ministers advise his majesty publicly to express sentiments of disapprobation upon the convention of cintra and when the question of the merits or demerits of this instrument comes before them in parliament the same persons who as advisers of the crown lately condemned the treaty now in their character of representatives of the people by the manner in which they received this motion have pronounced an encomium upon it <\s>
<s> for though as i have said the motion was inaccurately and inadequately worded it was not set aside upon this ground <\s>
<s> and the parliament has therefore persisted in withholding from the insulted and injured people and from their allies the only reparation which perhaps it may be in its power to grant has refused to signify its repentance and sorrow for what hath been done without which as a previous step there can be no proof no gratifying intimation even to this country or to its allies that the future efforts of the british parliament are in a sincere spirit <\s>
<s> the guilt of the transaction therefore being neither repented of nor atoned for the course of evil is by necessity persevered in but let us turn to a brighter region <\s>
<s> the events of the last year gloriously destroying many frail fears have placed in the rank of serene and immortal truths a proposition which as an object of belief hath in all ages been fondly cherished namely that a numerous nation determined to be free may effect its purpose in despite of the mightiest power which a foreign invader can bring against it <\s>
<s> these events also have pointed out how in the ways of nature and under the guidance of society this happy end is to be attained in other words they have shewn that the cause of the people in dangers and difficulties issuing from this quarter of oppression is safe while it remains not only in the bosom but in the hands of the people or what amounts to the same thing in those of a government which being truly from the people is faithfully for them <\s>
<s> while the power remained with the provincial juntas that is with the body natural of the community for those authorities newly generated in such adversity were truly living members of that body ); every thing prospered in spain <\s>
<s> hopes of the best kind were opened out and encouraged liberal opinions countenanced and wise measures arranged and last and except as proceeding from these least of all victories in the field in the streets of the city and upon the walls of the fortress <\s>
<s> i have heretofore styled it a blessing that the spanish people became their own masters at once <\s>
<s> it was a blessing but not without much alloy as the same disinterested generous passions which preserved and would for a season still have preserved them from a bad exercise of their power impelled them to part with it too soon before labours hitherto neither tried nor thought of had created throughout the country the minor excellences indispensible for the performance of those labours before powerful minds not hitherto of general note had found time to shew themselves and before men who were previously known had undergone the proof of new situations <\s>
<s> much therefore was wanting to direct the general judgement in the choice of persons when the second delegation took place which was a removal the first we have seen had not been so of the power from the people <\s>
<s> but when a common centre became absolutely necessary the power ought to have passed from the provincial assemblies into the hands of the cortes and into none else <\s>
<s> a pernicious oligarchy crept into the place of this comprehensive this constitutional this saving and majestic assembly <\s>
<s> far be it from me to speak of the supreme junta with ill advised condemnation every man must feel for the distressful trials to which that body has been exposed <\s>
<s> but eighty men or a hundred with a king at their head veiled under a cloud of fiction we might say with reference to the difficulties of this moment begotten upon a cloud of fiction could not be an image of a nation like that of spain or an adequate instrument of their power for their ends <\s>
<s> the assembly from the smallness of its numbers must have wanted breadth of wing to extend itself and brood over spain with a quickening touch of warmth every where <\s>
<s> if also as hath been mentioned there was a want of experience to determine the judgment in choice of persons this same smallness of numbers must have unnecessarily increased the evil by excluding many men of worth and talents which were so far known and allowed as that they would surely have been deputed to an assembly upon a larger scale <\s>
<s> gratitude habit and numerous other causes must have given an undue preponderance to birth station rank and fortune and have fixed the election more than was reasonable upon those who were most conspicuous for these distinctions men whose very virtue would incline them superstitiously to respect established things and to mistrust the people towards whom not only a frank confidence but a forward generosity was the first of duties <\s>
<s> i speak not of the vices to which such men would be liable brought up under the discipline of a government administered like the old monarchy of spain the matter is both ungracious and too obvious <\s>
<s> but i began with hope and hope has inwardly accompanied me to the end <\s>
<s> the whole course of the campaign rightly interpreted has justified my hope <\s>
<s> in madrid in ferrol in corunna in every considerable place and in every part of the country over which the french have re extended their dominion we learn from their own reports that the body of the people have shewed against them to the last the most determined hostility <\s>
<s> hence it is clear that the lure which the invading usurper found himself constrained lately to hold out to the inferior orders of society in the shape of various immunities has totally failed and therefore he turns for support to another quarter and now attempts to cajole the wealthy and the privileged <\s>
<s> but this class has been taught by late decrees what it has to expect from him and how far he is to be confided in for its especial interests <\s>
<s> many individuals no doubt he will seduce but the bulk of the class even if they could be insensible to more liberal feelings cannot but be his enemies <\s>
<s> this change therefore is not merely shifting ground but retiring to a position which he himself has previously undermined <\s>
<s> here is confusion and a power warring against itself <\s>
<s> so will it ever fare with foreign tyrants when in spite of domestic abuses a people which has lived long feels that it has a country to love and where the heart of that people is sound <\s>
<s> between the native inhabitants of france and spain there has existed from the earliest period and still does exist an universal and utter dissimilitude in laws actions deportment gait manners customs join with this the difference in the language and the barrier of the pyrenees a separation and an opposition in great things and an antipathy in small <\s>
<s> ignorant then must he be of history and of the reports of travellers and residents in the two countries or strangely inattentive to the constitution of human nature who this being true can admit the belief that the spaniards numerous and powerful as they are will live under frenchmen as their lords and masters <\s>
<s> let there be added to this inherent mutual repulsiveness those recent indignities and horrible outrages and we need not fear to say that such reconcilement is impossible even without that further insuperable obstacle which we hope will exist an establishment of a free constitution in spain the intoxicated setter up of kings may fill his diary with pompous stories of the acclamations with which his solemn puppets are received he may stuff their mouths with impious asseverations and hire knees to bend before them and lips to answer with honied greetings of gratitude and love these cannot remove the old heart and put a new one into the bosom of the spectators <\s>
<s> the whole is a pageant seen for a day among men in its passage to that limbo large and broad whither as to their proper home fleet all the unaccomplish'd works of nature's hand abortive monstrous or unkindly mix'd dissolv d on earth <\s>
<s> talk not of the perishable nature of enthusiasm and rise above a craving for perpetual manifestations of things <\s>
<s> he is to be pitied whose eye can only be pierced by the light of a meridian sun whose frame can only be warmed by the heat of midsummer <\s>
<s> let us hear no more of the little dependence to be had in war upon voluntary service <\s>
<s> the things with which we are primarily and mainly concerned are inward passions and not outward arrangements <\s>
<s> these latter may be given at any time when the parts to be put together are in readiness <\s>
<s> in the former instance year after year we imagined things to be what they were not and in this by a more fatal and more common delusion the thought of what things really are precludes the thought of what in a moment they may become the mind overlaid by the present cannot lift itself to attain a glimpse of the future <\s>
<s> all which is comparatively inherent or can lay claim to any degree of permanence in the tyranny which the french nation maintains over europe rests upon two foundations first upon the despotic rule which has been established in france over a powerful people who have lately passed from a state of revolution in which they supported a struggle begun for domestic liberty and long continued for liberty and national independence and secondly upon the personal character of the man by whom that rule is exercised <\s>
<s> as to the former every one knows that despotism in a general sense is but another word for weakness <\s>

<s> all which is comparatively inherent or can lay claim to any degree of permanence in the tyranny which the french nation maintains over europe rests upon two foundations first upon the despotic rule which has been established in france over a powerful people who have lately passed from a state of revolution in which they supported a struggle begun for domestic liberty and long continued for liberty and national independence and secondly upon the personal character of the man by whom that rule is exercised <\s>
<s> as to the former every one knows that despotism in a general sense is but another word for weakness <\s>
<s> let one generation disappear and a people over whom such rule has been extended if it have not virtue to free itself is condemned to embarrassment in the operations of its government and to perpetual languor with no better hope than that which may spring from the diseased activity of some particular prince on whom the authority may happen to devolve <\s>
<s> this if it takes a regular hereditary course but if the succession be interrupted and the supreme power frequently usurped or given by election worse evils follow <\s>

<s> the feebleness of despotic power we have had before our eyes in the late condition of spain and prussia and in that of france before the revolution and in the present condition of austria and russia <\s>
<s> but in a new born arbitrary and military government especially if like that of france it have been immediately preceded by a popular constitution not only this weakness is not found but it possesses for the purposes of external annoyance a preternatural vigour <\s>
<s> many causes contribute to this we need only mention that fitness real or supposed being necessarily the chief and almost sole recommendation to offices of trust it is clear that such offices will in general be ably filled and their duties comparatively well executed and that from the conjunction of absolute civil and military authority in a single person there naturally follows promptness of decision concentration of effort rapidity of motion and confidence that the movements made will be regularly supported <\s>
<s> this is all which need now be said upon the subject of this first basis of french tyranny <\s>
<s> for the second namely the personal character of the chief i shall at present content myself with noting to prevent misconception that this basis is not laid in any superiority of talents in him but in his utter rejection of the restraints of morality in wickedness which acknowledges no limit but the extent of its own power <\s>
<s> let any one reflect a moment and he will feel that a new world of forces is opened to a being who has made this desperate leap <\s>
<s> it is a tremendous principle to be adopted and steadily adhered to by a man in the station which buonaparte occupies and he has taken the full benefit of it <\s>
<s> what there is in this principle of weak perilous and self destructive i may find a grateful employment in endeavouring to shew upon some future occasion <\s>
<s> but it is a duty which we owe to the present moment to proclaim in vindication of the dignity of human nature and for an admonition to men of prostrate spirit that the dominion which this enemy of mankind holds has neither been acquired nor is sustained by endowments of intellect which are rarely bestowed or by uncommon accumulations of knowledge but that it has risen from circumstances over which he had no influence circumstances which with the power they conferred have stimulated passions whose natural food hath been and is ignorance from the barbarian impotence and insolence of a mind originally of ordinary constitution lagging in moral sentiment and knowledge three hundred years behind the age in which it acts <\s>
<s> in such manner did the power originate and by the forces which i have described is it maintained <\s>
<s> this should be declared and it should be added that the crimes of buonaparte are more to be abhorred than those of other denaturalized creatures whose actions are painted in history because the author of those crimes is guilty with less temptation and sins in the presence of a clearer light <\s>
<s> no doubt in the command of almost the whole military force of europe the subject which called upon me to make these distinctions he has at this moment a third source of power which may be added to these two <\s>
<s> he himself rates this last so high either is or affects to be so persuaded of its pre eminence that he boldly announces to the world that it is madness and even impiety to resist him <\s>
<s> and sorry may we be to remember that there are british senators who if a judgement may be formed from the language which they speak are inclined to accompany him far in this opinion <\s>
<s> but the enormity of this power has in it nothing inherent or permanent <\s>
<s> two signal overthrows in pitched battles would i believe go far to destroy it <\s>
<s> germans dutch italians swiss poles would desert the army of buonaparte and flock to the standard of his adversaries from the moment they could look towards it with that confidence which one or two conspicuous victories would inspire <\s>
<s> a regiment of 900 swiss joined the british army in portugal and if the french had been compelled to surrender as prisoners of war we should have seen that all those troops who were not native frenchmen would if encouragement had been given have joined the british and the opportunity that was lost of demonstrating this fact was not among the least of the mischiefs which attended the termination of the campaign in a word the vastness of buonaparte's military power is formidable not because it is impossible to break it but because it has not yet been penetrated <\s>
<s> in this respect it may not inaptly be compared to a huge pine forest such as are found in the northern parts of this island whose ability to resist the storms is in its skirts let but the blast once make an inroad and it levels the forest and sweeps it away at pleasure <\s>
<s> a hundred thousand men such as fought at vimiera and corunna would accomplish three such victories as i have been anticipating <\s>
<s> this nation might command a military force which would drive the french out of the peninsula i do not say that we could sustain there a military force which would prevent their re entering but that we could transplant thither by a great effort one which would expel them this i maintain and it is matter of thought in which infirm minds may find both reproach and instruction <\s>
<s> the spaniards could then take possession of their own fortresses and have leisure to give themselves a blended civil and military organization complete and animated by liberty which if once accomplished they would be able to protect themselves <\s>
<s> the oppressed continental powers also seeing such unquestionable proof that great britain was sincere and earnest would lift their heads again and by so doing would lighten the burthen of war which might remain for the spaniards <\s>
<s> in treating of this plan i have presumed that a general might be placed at the head of this great military power who would not sign a treaty like that of the convention of cintra and say look at the proceedings of the board of inquiry that he was determined to this by british interests or frame any treaty in the country of an ally save one purely military for the honourable preservation if necessary of his own army or part of it to which the sole or even the main inducement was our interests contra distinguished from those of that ally a general and a ministry whose policy would be comprehensive enough to perceive that the true welfare of britain is best promoted by the independence freedom and honour of other nations and that it is only by the diffusion and prevalence of these virtues that french tyranny can be ultimately reduced or the influence of france over the rest of europe brought within its natural and reasonable limits <\s>
<s> if this attempt be above the strain and temper of the country there remains only a plan laid down upon the other principles namely service as far as is required in things rather than in men that is men being secondary to things <\s>
<s> it is not i fear possible that the moral sentiments of the british army or government should accord with those of spain in her present condition <\s>
<s> commanding power indeed as hath been said put forth in the repulse of the common enemy would tend more effectually than any thing save the prevalence of true wisdom to prevent disagreement and to obviate any temporary injury which the moral spirit of the spaniards might receive from us at all events such power should there ensue any injury would bring a solid compensation <\s>
<s> but from a middle course an association sufficiently intimate and wide to scatter every where unkindly passions and yet unable to attain the salutary point of decisive power no good is to be expected <\s>
<s> great would be the evil at this momentous period if the hatred of the spaniards should look two ways <\s>
<s> let it be as steadily fixed upon the french as the pilot's eye upon his mark <\s>
<s> military stores and arms should be furnished with unfailing liberality let troops also be supplied but let these act separately taking strong positions upon the coast if such can be found to employ twice their numbers of the enemy and above all let there be floating armies keeping the enemy in constant uncertainty where he is to be attacked <\s>
<s> the peninsula frame of spain and portugal lays that region open to the full shock of british warfare <\s>
<s> our fleet and army should act wherever it is possible as parts of one body a right hand and a left and the enemy ought to be made to feel the force of both <\s>
<s> but whatever plans be adopted there can be no success unless the execution be entrusted to generals of competent judgement <\s>
<s> that the british army swarms with those who are incompetent is too plain from successive proofs in the transactions at buenos ayres at cintra and in the result of the board of inquiry nor must we see a general appointed to command and required at the same time to frame his operations according to the opinion of an inferior officer an injunction for a recommendation from such a quarter amounts to an injunction implying that a man had been appointed to a high station of which the very persons who had appointed him deemed him unworthy else they must have known that he would endeavour to profit by the experience of any of his inferior officers from the suggestions of his own understanding at the same time by denying to the general in chief the free use of his own judgement and by the act of announcing this presumption of his incompetence to the man himself such an indignity is put upon him that his passions must of necessity be rouzed so as to leave it scarcely possible that he could draw any benefit which he might otherwise have drawn from the local knowledge or talents of the individual to whom he was referred and lastly this injunction virtually involves a subversion of all military subordination <\s>
<s> in the better times of the house of commons a minister who had presumed to write such a letter as that to which i allude would have been impeached <\s>
<s> the debates in parliament and measures of government every day furnish new proofs of the truths which i have been attempting to establish of the utter want of general principles new and lamentable proofs <\s>
<s> this moment while i am drawing towards a conclusion i learn from the newspaper reports that the house of commons has refused to declare that the convention of centra disappointed the hopes and expectations of the nation <\s>
<s> the motion according to the letter of it was ill framed for the convention might have been a very good one and still have disappointed the hopes and expectations of the nation as those might have been unwise at all events the words ought to have stood the just and reasonable hopes of the nation <\s>
<s> but the hacknied phrase of disappointed hopes and expectations' should not have been used at all it is a centre round which much delusion has gathered <\s>
<s> the convention not only did not satisfy the nation's hopes of good but sunk it into a pitfall of unimagined and unimaginable evil <\s>
<s> the hearts and understandings of the people tell them that the language of a proposed parliamentary resolution upon this occasion ought not only to have been different in the letter but also widely different in the spirit and the reader of these pages will have deduced that no terms of reprobation could in severity exceed the offences involved in and connected with that instrument <\s>
<s> but while the grand keep of the castle of iniquity was to be stormed we have seen nothing but a puny assault upon heaps of the scattered rubbish of the fortress nay for the most part on some accidental mole hills at its base <\s>
<s> i do not speak thus in disrespect to the right hon <\s>
<s> gentleman who headed this attack <\s>
<s> his mind left to itself would i doubt not have prompted something worthier and higher but he moves in the phalanx of party a spiritual body in which by strange inconsistency the hampering weakening and destroying of every individual mind of which it is composed is the law which must constitute the strength of the whole <\s>
<s> the question was whether principles affecting the very existence of society had not been violated and an arm lifted and let fall which struck at the root of honour with the aggravation of the crime having been committed at this momentous period <\s>
<s> but what relation is there between these principles and actions and being in place or out of it <\s>
<s> if the people would constitutionally and resolutely assert their rights their representatives would be taught another lesson and for their own profit <\s>
<s> their understandings would be enriched accordingly for it is there there where least suspected that the want from which this country suffers chiefly lies <\s>
<s> they err who suppose that venality and corruption though now spreading more and more are the master evils of this day neither these nor immoderate craving for power are so much to be deprecated as the non existence of a widely ranging intellect of an intellect which if not efficacious to infuse truth as a vital fluid into the heart might at least make it a powerful tool in the hand <\s>
<s> outward profession which for practical purposes is an act of most desirable subservience would then wait upon those objects to which inward reverence though not felt was known to be due <\s>

<s> the ministers advise his majesty publicly to express sentiments of disapprobation upon the convention of cintra and when the question of the merits or demerits of this instrument comes before them in parliament the same persons who as advisers of the crown lately condemned the treaty now in their character of representatives of the people by the manner in which they received this motion have pronounced an encomium upon it <\s>
<s> for though as i have said the motion was inaccurately and inadequately worded it was not set aside upon this ground <\s>
<s> and the parliament has therefore persisted in withholding from the insulted and injured people and from their allies the only reparation which perhaps it may be in its power to grant has refused to signify its repentance and sorrow for what hath been done without which as a previous step there can be no proof no gratifying intimation even to this country or to its allies that the future efforts of the british parliament are in a sincere spirit <\s>
<s> the guilt of the transaction therefore being neither repented of nor atoned for the course of evil is by necessity persevered in but let us turn to a brighter region <\s>
<s> the events of the last year gloriously destroying many frail fears have placed in the rank of serene and immortal truths a proposition which as an object of belief hath in all ages been fondly cherished namely that a numerous nation determined to be free may effect its purpose in despite of the mightiest power which a foreign invader can bring against it <\s>
<s> these events also have pointed out how in the ways of nature and under the guidance of society this happy end is to be attained in other words they have shewn that the cause of the people in dangers and difficulties issuing from this quarter of oppression is safe while it remains not only in the bosom but in the hands of the people or what amounts to the same thing in those of a government which being truly from the people is faithfully for them <\s>
<s> while the power remained with the provincial juntas that is with the body natural of the community for those authorities newly generated in such adversity were truly living members of that body ); every thing prospered in spain <\s>
<s> hopes of the best kind were opened out and encouraged liberal opinions countenanced and wise measures arranged and last and except as proceeding from these least of all victories in the field in the streets of the city and upon the walls of the fortress <\s>
<s> i have heretofore styled it a blessing that the spanish people became their own masters at once <\s>
<s> it was a blessing but not without much alloy as the same disinterested generous passions which preserved and would for a season still have preserved them from a bad exercise of their power impelled them to part with it too soon before labours hitherto neither tried nor thought of had created throughout the country the minor excellences indispensible for the performance of those labours before powerful minds not hitherto of general note had found time to shew themselves and before men who were previously known had undergone the proof of new situations <\s>
<s> much therefore was wanting to direct the general judgement in the choice of persons when the second delegation took place which was a removal the first we have seen had not been so of the power from the people <\s>
<s> but when a common centre became absolutely necessary the power ought to have passed from the provincial assemblies into the hands of the cortes and into none else <\s>
<s> a pernicious oligarchy crept into the place of this comprehensive this constitutional this saving and majestic assembly <\s>
<s> far be it from me to speak of the supreme junta with ill advised condemnation every man must feel for the distressful trials to which that body has been exposed <\s>
<s> but eighty men or a hundred with a king at their head veiled under a cloud of fiction we might say with reference to the difficulties of this moment begotten upon a cloud of fiction could not be an image of a nation like that of spain or an adequate instrument of their power for their ends <\s>
<s> the assembly from the smallness of its numbers must have wanted breadth of wing to extend itself and brood over spain with a quickening touch of warmth every where <\s>
<s> if also as hath been mentioned there was a want of experience to determine the judgment in choice of persons this same smallness of numbers must have unnecessarily increased the evil by excluding many men of worth and talents which were so far known and allowed as that they would surely have been deputed to an assembly upon a larger scale <\s>
<s> gratitude habit and numerous other causes must have given an undue preponderance to birth station rank and fortune and have fixed the election more than was reasonable upon those who were most conspicuous for these distinctions men whose very virtue would incline them superstitiously to respect established things and to mistrust the people towards whom not only a frank confidence but a forward generosity was the first of duties <\s>
<s> i speak not of the vices to which such men would be liable brought up under the discipline of a government administered like the old monarchy of spain the matter is both ungracious and too obvious <\s>
<s> but i began with hope and hope has inwardly accompanied me to the end <\s>
<s> the whole course of the campaign rightly interpreted has justified my hope <\s>
<s> in madrid in ferrol in corunna in every considerable place and in every part of the country over which the french have re extended their dominion we learn from their own reports that the body of the people have shewed against them to the last the most determined hostility <\s>
<s> hence it is clear that the lure which the invading usurper found himself constrained lately to hold out to the inferior orders of society in the shape of various immunities has totally failed and therefore he turns for support to another quarter and now attempts to cajole the wealthy and the privileged <\s>
<s> but this class has been taught by late decrees what it has to expect from him and how far he is to be confided in for its especial interests <\s>
<s> many individuals no doubt he will seduce but the bulk of the class even if they could be insensible to more liberal feelings cannot but be his enemies <\s>
<s> this change therefore is not merely shifting ground but retiring to a position which he himself has previously undermined <\s>
<s> here is confusion and a power warring against itself <\s>
<s> so will it ever fare with foreign tyrants when in spite of domestic abuses a people which has lived long feels that it has a country to love and where the heart of that people is sound <\s>
<s> between the native inhabitants of france and spain there has existed from the earliest period and still does exist an universal and utter dissimilitude in laws actions deportment gait manners customs join with this the difference in the language and the barrier of the pyrenees a separation and an opposition in great things and an antipathy in small <\s>
<s> ignorant then must he be of history and of the reports of travellers and residents in the two countries or strangely inattentive to the constitution of human nature who this being true can admit the belief that the spaniards numerous and powerful as they are will live under frenchmen as their lords and masters <\s>
<s> let there be added to this inherent mutual repulsiveness those recent indignities and horrible outrages and we need not fear to say that such reconcilement is impossible even without that further insuperable obstacle which we hope will exist an establishment of a free constitution in spain the intoxicated setter up of kings may fill his diary with pompous stories of the acclamations with which his solemn puppets are received he may stuff their mouths with impious asseverations and hire knees to bend before them and lips to answer with honied greetings of gratitude and love these cannot remove the old heart and put a new one into the bosom of the spectators <\s>
<s> the whole is a pageant seen for a day among men in its passage to that limbo large and broad whither as to their proper home fleet all the unaccomplish'd works of nature's hand abortive monstrous or unkindly mix'd dissolv d on earth <\s>
<s> talk not of the perishable nature of enthusiasm and rise above a craving for perpetual manifestations of things <\s>
<s> he is to be pitied whose eye can only be pierced by the light of a meridian sun whose frame can only be warmed by the heat of midsummer <\s>
<s> let us hear no more of the little dependence to be had in war upon voluntary service <\s>
<s> the things with which we are primarily and mainly concerned are inward passions and not outward arrangements <\s>
<s> these latter may be given at any time when the parts to be put together are in readiness <\s>
<s> in the former instance year after year we imagined things to be what they were not and in this by a more fatal and more common delusion the thought of what things really are precludes the thought of what in a moment they may become the mind overlaid by the present cannot lift itself to attain a glimpse of the future <\s>
<s> all which is comparatively inherent or can lay claim to any degree of permanence in the tyranny which the french nation maintains over europe rests upon two foundations first upon the despotic rule which has been established in france over a powerful people who have lately passed from a state of revolution in which they supported a struggle begun for domestic liberty and long continued for liberty and national independence and secondly upon the personal character of the man by whom that rule is exercised <\s>
<s> as to the former every one knows that despotism in a general sense is but another word for weakness <\s>
<s> let one generation disappear and a people over whom such rule has been extended if it have not virtue to free itself is condemned to embarrassment in the operations of its government and to perpetual languor with no better hope than that which may spring from the diseased activity of some particular prince on whom the authority may happen to devolve <\s>
<s> this if it takes a regular hereditary course but if the succession be interrupted and the supreme power frequently usurped or given by election worse evils follow <\s>
<s> science and art must dwindle whether the power be hereditary or not and the virtues of a trajan or an antonine are a hollow support for the feeling of contentment and happiness in the hearts of their subjects such virtues are even a painful mockery something that is and may vanish in a moment and leave the monstrous crimes of a caracalla or a domitian in its place men who are probably leaders of a long procession of their kind <\s>
<s> the feebleness of despotic power we have had before our eyes in the late condition of spain and prussia and in that of france before the revolution and in the present condition of austria and russia <\s>
<s> but in a new born arbitrary and military government especially if like that of france it have been immediately preceded by a popular constitution not only this weakness is not found but it possesses for the purposes of external annoyance a preternatural vigour <\s>
<s> many causes contribute to this we need only mention that fitness real or supposed being necessarily the chief and almost sole recommendation to offices of trust it is clear that such offices will in general be ably filled and their duties comparatively well executed and that from the conjunction of absolute civil and military authority in a single person there naturally follows promptness of decision concentration of effort rapidity of motion and confidence that the movements made will be regularly supported <\s>
<s> this is all which need now be said upon the subject of this first basis of french tyranny <\s>
<s> for the second namely the personal character of the chief i shall at present content myself with noting to prevent misconception that this basis is not laid in any superiority of talents in him but in his utter rejection of the restraints of morality in wickedness which acknowledges no limit but the extent of its own power <\s>
<s> let any one reflect a moment and he will feel that a new world of forces is opened to a being who has made this desperate leap <\s>
<s> it is a tremendous principle to be adopted and steadily adhered to by a man in the station which buonaparte occupies and he has taken the full benefit of it <\s>
<s> what there is in this principle of weak perilous and self destructive i may find a grateful employment in endeavouring to shew upon some future occasion <\s>
<s> but it is a duty which we owe to the present moment to proclaim in vindication of the dignity of human nature and for an admonition to men of prostrate spirit that the dominion which this enemy of mankind holds has neither been acquired nor is sustained by endowments of intellect which are rarely bestowed or by uncommon accumulations of knowledge but that it has risen from circumstances over which he had no influence circumstances which with the power they conferred have stimulated passions whose natural food hath been and is ignorance from the barbarian impotence and insolence of a mind originally of ordinary constitution lagging in moral sentiment and knowledge three hundred years behind the age in which it acts <\s>

<s> in the former instance year after year we imagined things to be what they were not and in this by a more fatal and more common delusion the thought of what things really are precludes the thought of what in a moment they may become the mind overlaid by the present cannot lift itself to attain a glimpse of the future <\s>
<s> all which is comparatively inherent or can lay claim to any degree of permanence in the tyranny which the french nation maintains over europe rests upon two foundations first upon the despotic rule which has been established in france over a powerful people who have lately passed from a state of revolution in which they supported a struggle begun for domestic liberty and long continued for liberty and national independence and secondly upon the personal character of the man by whom that rule is exercised <\s>
<s> as to the former every one knows that despotism in a general sense is but another word for weakness <\s>
<s> let one generation disappear and a people over whom such rule has been extended if it have not virtue to free itself is condemned to embarrassment in the operations of its government and to perpetual languor with no better hope than that which may spring from the diseased activity of some particular prince on whom the authority may happen to devolve <\s>
<s> this if it takes a regular hereditary course but if the succession be interrupted and the supreme power frequently usurped or given by election worse evils follow <\s>
<s> science and art must dwindle whether the power be hereditary or not and the virtues of a trajan or an antonine are a hollow support for the feeling of contentment and happiness in the hearts of their subjects such virtues are even a painful mockery something that is and may vanish in a moment and leave the monstrous crimes of a caracalla or a domitian in its place men who are probably leaders of a long procession of their kind <\s>
<s> the feebleness of despotic power we have had before our eyes in the late condition of spain and prussia and in that of france before the revolution and in the present condition of austria and russia <\s>
<s> but in a new born arbitrary and military government especially if like that of france it have been immediately preceded by a popular constitution not only this weakness is not found but it possesses for the purposes of external annoyance a preternatural vigour <\s>
<s> many causes contribute to this we need only mention that fitness real or supposed being necessarily the chief and almost sole recommendation to offices of trust it is clear that such offices will in general be ably filled and their duties comparatively well executed and that from the conjunction of absolute civil and military authority in a single person there naturally follows promptness of decision concentration of effort rapidity of motion and confidence that the movements made will be regularly supported <\s>
<s> this is all which need now be said upon the subject of this first basis of french tyranny <\s>
<s> for the second namely the personal character of the chief i shall at present content myself with noting to prevent misconception that this basis is not laid in any superiority of talents in him but in his utter rejection of the restraints of morality in wickedness which acknowledges no limit but the extent of its own power <\s>
<s> let any one reflect a moment and he will feel that a new world of forces is opened to a being who has made this desperate leap <\s>
<s> it is a tremendous principle to be adopted and steadily adhered to by a man in the station which buonaparte occupies and he has taken the full benefit of it <\s>
<s> what there is in this principle of weak perilous and self destructive i may find a grateful employment in endeavouring to shew upon some future occasion <\s>
<s> but it is a duty which we owe to the present moment to proclaim in vindication of the dignity of human nature and for an admonition to men of prostrate spirit that the dominion which this enemy of mankind holds has neither been acquired nor is sustained by endowments of intellect which are rarely bestowed or by uncommon accumulations of knowledge but that it has risen from circumstances over which he had no influence circumstances which with the power they conferred have stimulated passions whose natural food hath been and is ignorance from the barbarian impotence and insolence of a mind originally of ordinary constitution lagging in moral sentiment and knowledge three hundred years behind the age in which it acts <\s>
<s> in such manner did the power originate and by the forces which i have described is it maintained <\s>
<s> this should be declared and it should be added that the crimes of buonaparte are more to be abhorred than those of other denaturalized creatures whose actions are painted in history because the author of those crimes is guilty with less temptation and sins in the presence of a clearer light <\s>
<s> no doubt in the command of almost the whole military force of europe the subject which called upon me to make these distinctions he has at this moment a third source of power which may be added to these two <\s>
<s> he himself rates this last so high either is or affects to be so persuaded of its pre eminence that he boldly announces to the world that it is madness and even impiety to resist him <\s>
<s> and sorry may we be to remember that there are british senators who if a judgement may be formed from the language which they speak are inclined to accompany him far in this opinion <\s>
<s> but the enormity of this power has in it nothing inherent or permanent <\s>
<s> two signal overthrows in pitched battles would i believe go far to destroy it <\s>
<s> germans dutch italians swiss poles would desert the army of buonaparte and flock to the standard of his adversaries from the moment they could look towards it with that confidence which one or two conspicuous victories would inspire <\s>
<s> a regiment of 900 swiss joined the british army in portugal and if the french had been compelled to surrender as prisoners of war we should have seen that all those troops who were not native frenchmen would if encouragement had been given have joined the british and the opportunity that was lost of demonstrating this fact was not among the least of the mischiefs which attended the termination of the campaign in a word the vastness of buonaparte's military power is formidable not because it is impossible to break it but because it has not yet been penetrated <\s>
<s> in this respect it may not inaptly be compared to a huge pine forest such as are found in the northern parts of this island whose ability to resist the storms is in its skirts let but the blast once make an inroad and it levels the forest and sweeps it away at pleasure <\s>
<s> a hundred thousand men such as fought at vimiera and corunna would accomplish three such victories as i have been anticipating <\s>
<s> this nation might command a military force which would drive the french out of the peninsula i do not say that we could sustain there a military force which would prevent their re entering but that we could transplant thither by a great effort one which would expel them this i maintain and it is matter of thought in which infirm minds may find both reproach and instruction <\s>
<s> the spaniards could then take possession of their own fortresses and have leisure to give themselves a blended civil and military organization complete and animated by liberty which if once accomplished they would be able to protect themselves <\s>
<s> the oppressed continental powers also seeing such unquestionable proof that great britain was sincere and earnest would lift their heads again and by so doing would lighten the burthen of war which might remain for the spaniards <\s>
<s> in treating of this plan i have presumed that a general might be placed at the head of this great military power who would not sign a treaty like that of the convention of cintra and say look at the proceedings of the board of inquiry that he was determined to this by british interests or frame any treaty in the country of an ally save one purely military for the honourable preservation if necessary of his own army or part of it to which the sole or even the main inducement was our interests contra distinguished from those of that ally a general and a ministry whose policy would be comprehensive enough to perceive that the true welfare of britain is best promoted by the independence freedom and honour of other nations and that it is only by the diffusion and prevalence of these virtues that french tyranny can be ultimately reduced or the influence of france over the rest of europe brought within its natural and reasonable limits <\s>
<s> if this attempt be above the strain and temper of the country there remains only a plan laid down upon the other principles namely service as far as is required in things rather than in men that is men being secondary to things <\s>
<s> it is not i fear possible that the moral sentiments of the british army or government should accord with those of spain in her present condition <\s>
<s> commanding power indeed as hath been said put forth in the repulse of the common enemy would tend more effectually than any thing save the prevalence of true wisdom to prevent disagreement and to obviate any temporary injury which the moral spirit of the spaniards might receive from us at all events such power should there ensue any injury would bring a solid compensation <\s>
<s> but from a middle course an association sufficiently intimate and wide to scatter every where unkindly passions and yet unable to attain the salutary point of decisive power no good is to be expected <\s>
<s> great would be the evil at this momentous period if the hatred of the spaniards should look two ways <\s>
<s> let it be as steadily fixed upon the french as the pilot's eye upon his mark <\s>
<s> military stores and arms should be furnished with unfailing liberality let troops also be supplied but let these act separately taking strong positions upon the coast if such can be found to employ twice their numbers of the enemy and above all let there be floating armies keeping the enemy in constant uncertainty where he is to be attacked <\s>
<s> the peninsula frame of spain and portugal lays that region open to the full shock of british warfare <\s>
<s> our fleet and army should act wherever it is possible as parts of one body a right hand and a left and the enemy ought to be made to feel the force of both <\s>
<s> but whatever plans be adopted there can be no success unless the execution be entrusted to generals of competent judgement <\s>
<s> that the british army swarms with those who are incompetent is too plain from successive proofs in the transactions at buenos ayres at cintra and in the result of the board of inquiry nor must we see a general appointed to command and required at the same time to frame his operations according to the opinion of an inferior officer an injunction for a recommendation from such a quarter amounts to an injunction implying that a man had been appointed to a high station of which the very persons who had appointed him deemed him unworthy else they must have known that he would endeavour to profit by the experience of any of his inferior officers from the suggestions of his own understanding at the same time by denying to the general in chief the free use of his own judgement and by the act of announcing this presumption of his incompetence to the man himself such an indignity is put upon him that his passions must of necessity be rouzed so as to leave it scarcely possible that he could draw any benefit which he might otherwise have drawn from the local knowledge or talents of the individual to whom he was referred and lastly this injunction virtually involves a subversion of all military subordination <\s>
<s> in the better times of the house of commons a minister who had presumed to write such a letter as that to which i allude would have been impeached <\s>
<s> the debates in parliament and measures of government every day furnish new proofs of the truths which i have been attempting to establish of the utter want of general principles new and lamentable proofs <\s>
<s> this moment while i am drawing towards a conclusion i learn from the newspaper reports that the house of commons has refused to declare that the convention of centra disappointed the hopes and expectations of the nation <\s>
<s> the motion according to the letter of it was ill framed for the convention might have been a very good one and still have disappointed the hopes and expectations of the nation as those might have been unwise at all events the words ought to have stood the just and reasonable hopes of the nation <\s>
<s> but the hacknied phrase of disappointed hopes and expectations' should not have been used at all it is a centre round which much delusion has gathered <\s>
<s> the convention not only did not satisfy the nation's hopes of good but sunk it into a pitfall of unimagined and unimaginable evil <\s>
<s> the hearts and understandings of the people tell them that the language of a proposed parliamentary resolution upon this occasion ought not only to have been different in the letter but also widely different in the spirit and the reader of these pages will have deduced that no terms of reprobation could in severity exceed the offences involved in and connected with that instrument <\s>
<s> but while the grand keep of the castle of iniquity was to be stormed we have seen nothing but a puny assault upon heaps of the scattered rubbish of the fortress nay for the most part on some accidental mole hills at its base <\s>
<s> i do not speak thus in disrespect to the right hon <\s>
<s> gentleman who headed this attack <\s>
<s> his mind left to itself would i doubt not have prompted something worthier and higher but he moves in the phalanx of party a spiritual body in which by strange inconsistency the hampering weakening and destroying of every individual mind of which it is composed is the law which must constitute the strength of the whole <\s>
<s> the question was whether principles affecting the very existence of society had not been violated and an arm lifted and let fall which struck at the root of honour with the aggravation of the crime having been committed at this momentous period <\s>
<s> but what relation is there between these principles and actions and being in place or out of it <\s>
<s> if the people would constitutionally and resolutely assert their rights their representatives would be taught another lesson and for their own profit <\s>
<s> their understandings would be enriched accordingly for it is there there where least suspected that the want from which this country suffers chiefly lies <\s>
<s> they err who suppose that venality and corruption though now spreading more and more are the master evils of this day neither these nor immoderate craving for power are so much to be deprecated as the non existence of a widely ranging intellect of an intellect which if not efficacious to infuse truth as a vital fluid into the heart might at least make it a powerful tool in the hand <\s>
<s> outward profession which for practical purposes is an act of most desirable subservience would then wait upon those objects to which inward reverence though not felt was known to be due <\s>
<s> schemes of ample reach and true benefit would also promise best to insure the rewards coveted by personal ambition and men of baser passions finding it their interest would naturally combine to perform useful service under the direction of strong minds while men of good intentions would have their own pure satisfaction and would exert themselves with more upright i mean more hopeful cheerfulness and more successfully <\s>
<s> it is not therefore inordinate desire of wealth or power which is so injurious as the means which are and must be employed in the present intellectual condition of the legislature to sustain and secure that power these are at once an effect of barrenness and a cause acting and mutually re acting incessantly <\s>
<s> an enlightened friend has in conversation observed to the author of these pages that formerly the principles of men wore better than they who held them but that now a far worse evil men are better than their principles <\s>
<s> i believe it of the deplorable quality and state of principles the public proceedings in our country furnish daily new proof <\s>
<s> it is however some consolation at this present crisis to find that of the thoughts and feelings uttered during the two debates which led me to these painful declarations such as approach towards truth which has any dignity in it come from the side of his majesty's ministers but note again those contradictions to which i have so often been obliged to advert <\s>
<s> the ministers advise his majesty publicly to express sentiments of disapprobation upon the convention of cintra and when the question of the merits or demerits of this instrument comes before them in parliament the same persons who as advisers of the crown lately condemned the treaty now in their character of representatives of the people by the manner in which they received this motion have pronounced an encomium upon it <\s>
<s> for though as i have said the motion was inaccurately and inadequately worded it was not set aside upon this ground <\s>
<s> and the parliament has therefore persisted in withholding from the insulted and injured people and from their allies the only reparation which perhaps it may be in its power to grant has refused to signify its repentance and sorrow for what hath been done without which as a previous step there can be no proof no gratifying intimation even to this country or to its allies that the future efforts of the british parliament are in a sincere spirit <\s>
<s> the guilt of the transaction therefore being neither repented of nor atoned for the course of evil is by necessity persevered in but let us turn to a brighter region <\s>

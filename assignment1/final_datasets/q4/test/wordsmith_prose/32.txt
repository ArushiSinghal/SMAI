<s> as you will have seen we had little to live upon and he as little lord lonsdale being then alive <\s>

<s> he went to sea as commander with this hope his voyage was very unsuccessful he having lost by it considerably <\s>
<s> when he came home we chanced to be in london and saw him <\s>
<s> said he i have thought of you and nothing but you if ever of myself and my bad success it was only on your account <\s>
<s> he went again to sea a second time and also was unsuccessful still with the same hopes on our account though then not so necessary lord lowther having paid the money 52 lastly came the lamentable voyage which he entered upon full of expectation and love to his sister and myself and my wife whom indeed he loved with all a brother's tenderness <\s>
<s> this is the end of his part of the agreement of his efforts for my welfare <\s>
<s> god grant me life and strength to fulfil mine <\s>
<s> i shall never forget him never lose sight of him there is a bond between us yet the same as if he were living nay far more sacred calling upon me to do my utmost as he to the last did his utmost to live in honour and worthiness <\s>
<s> some of the newspapers carelessly asserted that he did not wish to survive his ship <\s>
<s> he was heard by one of the surviving officers giving orders with all possible calmness a very little before the ship went down and when he could remain at his post no longer then and not till then he attempted to save himself <\s>
<s> i knew this would be so but it was satisfactory for me to have it confirmed by external evidence <\s>
<s> do not think our grief unreasonable <\s>
<s> of all human beings whom i ever knew he was the man of the most rational desires the most sedate habits and the most perfect self command <\s>

<s> your most affectionate friend w <\s>
<s> again grasmere march 12 <\s>
<s> as i have said your last letter affected me much <\s>
<s> a thousand times have i asked myself as your tender sympathy led me to do why was he taken away <\s>
<s> and i have answered the question as you have done <\s>
<s> in fact there is no other answer which can satisfy and lay the mind at rest <\s>
<s> why have we a choice and a will and a notion of justice and injustice enabling us to be moral agents <\s>
<s> why have we sympathies that make the best of us so afraid of inflicting pain and sorrow which yet we see dealt about so lavishly by the supreme governor <\s>
<s> why should our notions of right towards each other and to all sentient beings within our influence differ so widely from what appears to be his notion and rule if every thing were to end here <\s>
<s> would it not be blasphemy to say that upon the supposition of the thinking principle being destroyed by death however inferior we may be to the great cause and ruler of things we have more of love in our nature than he has <\s>
<s> the thought is monstrous and yet how to get rid of it except upon the supposition of another and a better world i do not see <\s>
<s> as to my departed brother who leads our minds at present to these reflections he walked all his life pure among many impure <\s>
<s> except a little hastiness of temper when any thing was done in a clumsy or bungling manner or when improperly contradicted upon occasions of not much importance he had not one vice of his profession <\s>
<s> i never heard an oath or even an indelicate expression or allusion from him in my life his modesty was equal to that of the purest woman <\s>
<s> in prudence in meekness in self denial in fortitude in just desires and elegant and refined enjoyments with an entire simplicity of manners life and habit he was all that could be wished for in man strong in health and of a noble person with every hope about him that could render life dear thinking of and living only for others and we see what has been his end <\s>
<s> so good must be better so high must be destined to be higher <\s>
<s> i will take this opportunity of saying that the newspaper accounts of the loss of the ship are throughout grossly inaccurate <\s>
<s> the chief facts i will state in a few words from the deposition at the india house of one of the surviving officers <\s>
<s> she struck at 5 p m <\s>
<s> guns were fired immediately and were continued to be fired <\s>
<s> she was gotten off the rock at half past seven but had taken in so much water in spite of constant pumping as to be water logged <\s>
<s> they had however hope that she might still be run upon weymouth sands and with this view continued pumping and baling till eleven when she went down <\s>
<s> the longboat could not be hoisted out as had that been done there would have been no possibility of the ship being run aground <\s>
<s> i have mentioned these things because the newspaper accounts were such as tended to throw discredit on my brother's conduct and personal firmness stating that the ship had struck an hour and a half before guns were fired and that in the agony of the moment the boats had been forgotten to be hoisted out <\s>
<s> we knew well this could not be but for the sake of the relatives of the persons lost it distressed us much that it should have been said <\s>
<s> a few minutes before the ship went down my brother was seen talking with the first mate with apparent cheerfulness and he was standing on the hen coop which is the point from which he could overlook the whole ship the moment she went down dying as he had lived in the very place and point where his duty stationed him <\s>
<s> i must beg your pardon for detaining you so long on this melancholy subject and yet it is not altogether melancholy for what nobler spectacle can be contemplated than that of a virtuous man with a serene countenance in such an overwhelming situation <\s>
<s> i will here transcribe a passage which i met with the other day in a review it is from aristotle's synopsis of the virtues and vices 53 it is says he the property of fortitude not to be easily terrified by the dread of things pertaining to death to possess good confidence in things terrible and presence of mind in dangers rather to prefer to be put to death worthily than to be preserved basely and to be the cause of victory <\s>
<s> moreover it is the property of fortitude to labour and endure and to make valorous exertion an object of choice <\s>
<s> further presence of mind a well disposed soul confidence and boldness are the attendants on fortitude and besides these industry and patience <\s>
<s> except in the circumstance of making valorous exertion an object of choice if the philosopher alludes to general habits of character my brother might have sat for this picture but he was of a meek and retired nature loving all quiet things <\s>
<s> i remain dear sir george your most affectionate friend w <\s>
<s> the following to his friend southey was written the morrow after the arrival of the sad tidings tuesday evening grasmere 1805 <\s>
<s> we see nothing here that does not remind us of our dear brother there is nothing about us save the children whom he had not seen that he has not known and loved <\s>
<s> if you could bear to come to this house of mourning to morrow i should be for ever thankful <\s>
<s> we weep much to day and that relieves us <\s>
<s> as to fortitude i hope i shall show that and that all of us will show it in a proper time in keeping down many a silent pang hereafter <\s>
<s> but grief will as you say and must have its course there is no wisdom in attempting to check it under the circumstances which we are all of us in here <\s>
<s> i condole with you from my soul on the melancholy account of your own brother's situation god grant you may not hear such tidings <\s>
<s> it makes the heart groan that with such a beautiful world as this to live in and such a soul as that of man's is by nature and gift of god that we should go about on such errands as we do destroying and laying waste and ninety nine of us in a hundred never easy in any road that travels towards peace and quietness <\s>
<s> and yet what virtue and what goodness what heroism and courage what triumphs of disinterested love everywhere and human life after all what is it <\s>
<s> surely this is not to be for ever even on this perishable planet <\s>

<s> he wrote to us from portsmouth about twelve days before this disaster full of hopes saying that he was to sail to morrow <\s>
<s> of course at the time when we heard this deplorable news we imagined that he was as far on his voyage as madeira <\s>
<s> it was indeed a thunderstroke to us <\s>
<s> the language which he held was always so encouraging saying that ships were in nine instances out of ten lost by mismanagement he had indeed a great fear of pilots and i have often heard him say that no situation could be imagined more distressing than that of being at the mercy of these men <\s>
<s> said he it is a joyful hour for us when we get rid of them <\s>
<s> they are in several places incorrect and sometimes uncouth in language and perhaps in some inharmonious yet upon the whole i think the music exceedingly well suited to its end that is it has an energetic and varied flow of sound crowding into narrow room more of the combined effect of rhyme and blank verse than can be done by any other kind of verse i know <\s>

<s> the chief facts i will state in a few words from the deposition at the india house of one of the surviving officers <\s>
<s> she struck at 5 p m <\s>
<s> guns were fired immediately and were continued to be fired <\s>
<s> she was gotten off the rock at half past seven but had taken in so much water in spite of constant pumping as to be water logged <\s>
<s> they had however hope that she might still be run upon weymouth sands and with this view continued pumping and baling till eleven when she went down <\s>
<s> the longboat could not be hoisted out as had that been done there would have been no possibility of the ship being run aground <\s>
<s> i have mentioned these things because the newspaper accounts were such as tended to throw discredit on my brother's conduct and personal firmness stating that the ship had struck an hour and a half before guns were fired and that in the agony of the moment the boats had been forgotten to be hoisted out <\s>
<s> we knew well this could not be but for the sake of the relatives of the persons lost it distressed us much that it should have been said <\s>
<s> a few minutes before the ship went down my brother was seen talking with the first mate with apparent cheerfulness and he was standing on the hen coop which is the point from which he could overlook the whole ship the moment she went down dying as he had lived in the very place and point where his duty stationed him <\s>
<s> i must beg your pardon for detaining you so long on this melancholy subject and yet it is not altogether melancholy for what nobler spectacle can be contemplated than that of a virtuous man with a serene countenance in such an overwhelming situation <\s>
<s> i will here transcribe a passage which i met with the other day in a review it is from aristotle's synopsis of the virtues and vices 53 it is says he the property of fortitude not to be easily terrified by the dread of things pertaining to death to possess good confidence in things terrible and presence of mind in dangers rather to prefer to be put to death worthily than to be preserved basely and to be the cause of victory <\s>
<s> moreover it is the property of fortitude to labour and endure and to make valorous exertion an object of choice <\s>
<s> further presence of mind a well disposed soul confidence and boldness are the attendants on fortitude and besides these industry and patience <\s>
<s> except in the circumstance of making valorous exertion an object of choice if the philosopher alludes to general habits of character my brother might have sat for this picture but he was of a meek and retired nature loving all quiet things <\s>
<s> i remain dear sir george your most affectionate friend w <\s>
<s> the following to his friend southey was written the morrow after the arrival of the sad tidings tuesday evening grasmere 1805 <\s>
<s> we see nothing here that does not remind us of our dear brother there is nothing about us save the children whom he had not seen that he has not known and loved <\s>
<s> if you could bear to come to this house of mourning to morrow i should be for ever thankful <\s>
<s> we weep much to day and that relieves us <\s>
<s> as to fortitude i hope i shall show that and that all of us will show it in a proper time in keeping down many a silent pang hereafter <\s>
<s> but grief will as you say and must have its course there is no wisdom in attempting to check it under the circumstances which we are all of us in here <\s>
<s> i condole with you from my soul on the melancholy account of your own brother's situation god grant you may not hear such tidings <\s>
<s> it makes the heart groan that with such a beautiful world as this to live in and such a soul as that of man's is by nature and gift of god that we should go about on such errands as we do destroying and laying waste and ninety nine of us in a hundred never easy in any road that travels towards peace and quietness <\s>
<s> and yet what virtue and what goodness what heroism and courage what triumphs of disinterested love everywhere and human life after all what is it <\s>
<s> surely this is not to be for ever even on this perishable planet <\s>
<s> come to us to morrow if you can your conversation i know will do me good <\s>
<s> all send best remembrances to you all <\s>
<s> your affectionate friend w <\s>
<s> the following to another friend completes the sad tale grasmere march 16 <\s>
<s> he wrote to us from portsmouth about twelve days before this disaster full of hopes saying that he was to sail to morrow <\s>
<s> of course at the time when we heard this deplorable news we imagined that he was as far on his voyage as madeira <\s>
<s> it was indeed a thunderstroke to us <\s>
<s> the language which he held was always so encouraging saying that ships were in nine instances out of ten lost by mismanagement he had indeed a great fear of pilots and i have often heard him say that no situation could be imagined more distressing than that of being at the mercy of these men <\s>
<s> said he it is a joyful hour for us when we get rid of them <\s>

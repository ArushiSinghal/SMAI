<s> reviewing at this late period 1843 what i put into the mouths of my interlocutors a few years after the commencement of the century i grieve that so little progress has been made in diminishing the evils deplored or promoting the benefits of education which the wanderer anticipates <\s>
<s> the results of lord ashley's labours to defer the time when children might legally be allowed to work in factories and his endeavours to still further limit the hours of permitted labour have fallen far short of his own humane wishes and of those of every benevolent and right minded man who has carefully attended to this subject and in the present session of parliament 1843 sir james graham's attempt to establish a course of religious education among the children employed in factories has been abandoned in consequence of what might easily have been foreseen the vehement and turbulent opposition of the dissenters so that for many years to come it may be thought expedient to leave the religious instruction of children entirely in the hands of the several denominations of christians in the island each body to work according to its own means and in its own way <\s>
<s> such is my own confidence a confidence i share with many others of my most valued friends in the superior advantages both religious and social which attend a course of instruction presided over and guided by the clergy of the church of england that i have no doubt that if but once its members lay and clerical were duly sensible of those benefits their church would daily gain ground and rapidly upon every shape and fashion of dissent and in that case a great majority in parliament being sensible of these benefits the ministers of the country might be emboldened were it necessary to apply funds of the state to the support of education on church principles <\s>
<s> before i conclude i cannot forbear noticing the strenuous efforts made at this time in parliament by so many persons to extend manufacturing and commercial industry at the expense of agricultural though we have recently had abundant proofs that the apprehensions expressed by the wanderer were not groundless <\s>
<s> i spake of mischief by the wise diffused with gladness thinking that the more it spreads the healthier the securer we become delusion which a moment may destroy <\s>

<s> the blind man next commemorated was john gough of kendal a man known far beyond his neighbourhood for his talents and attainments in natural history and science <\s>
<s> of the infants grave next noticed i will only say it is an exact picture of what fell under my own observation and all persons who are intimately acquainted with cottage life must often have observed like instances of the working of the domestic affections <\s>
<s> a volley thrice repeated this young volunteer bore the name of dawson and was younger brother if i am not mistaken to the prodigal of whose character and fortunes an account is given towards the beginning of the preceding book <\s>
<s> the father of the family i knew well he was a man of literary education and considerable experience in society much beyond what was common among the inhabitants of the vale <\s>
<s> he had lived a good while in the highlands of scotland as a manager of iron works at bunaw and had acted as clerk to one of my predecessors in the office of distributor of stamps when he used to travel round the country collecting and bringing home the money due to government in gold which it may be worth while to mention for the sake of my friends was deposited in the cell or iron closet under the west window which still exists with the iron doors that guarded the property <\s>
<s> this of course was before the time of bills and notes <\s>
<s> the two sons of this person had no doubt been led by the knowledge of their father to take more delight in scholarship and had been accustomed in their own minds to take a wider view of social interests than was usual among their associates <\s>
<s> the premature death of this gallant young man was much lamented and as an attendant upon the funeral i myself witnessed the ceremony and the effect of it as described in the poems tradition tells that in eliza's golden days a knight came on a war horse the house is gone <\s>

<s> what follows in the discourse of the wanderer upon the changes he had witnessed in rural life by the introduction of machinery is truly described from what i myself saw during my boyhood and early youth and from what was often told me by persons of this humble calling <\s>
<s> happily most happily for these mountains the mischief was diverted from the banks of their beautiful streams and transferred to open and flat counties abounding in coal where the agency of steam was found much more effectual for carrying on those demoralising works <\s>
<s> had it not been for this invention long before the present time every torrent and river in this district would have had its factory large and populous in proportion to the power of the water that could there be commanded <\s>
<s> parliament has interfered to prevent the night work which was carried on in these mills as actively as during the daytime and by necessity still more perniciously a sad disgrace to the proprietors and to the nation which could so long tolerate such unnatural proceedings <\s>
<s> reviewing at this late period 1843 what i put into the mouths of my interlocutors a few years after the commencement of the century i grieve that so little progress has been made in diminishing the evils deplored or promoting the benefits of education which the wanderer anticipates <\s>
<s> the results of lord ashley's labours to defer the time when children might legally be allowed to work in factories and his endeavours to still further limit the hours of permitted labour have fallen far short of his own humane wishes and of those of every benevolent and right minded man who has carefully attended to this subject and in the present session of parliament 1843 sir james graham's attempt to establish a course of religious education among the children employed in factories has been abandoned in consequence of what might easily have been foreseen the vehement and turbulent opposition of the dissenters so that for many years to come it may be thought expedient to leave the religious instruction of children entirely in the hands of the several denominations of christians in the island each body to work according to its own means and in its own way <\s>
<s> such is my own confidence a confidence i share with many others of my most valued friends in the superior advantages both religious and social which attend a course of instruction presided over and guided by the clergy of the church of england that i have no doubt that if but once its members lay and clerical were duly sensible of those benefits their church would daily gain ground and rapidly upon every shape and fashion of dissent and in that case a great majority in parliament being sensible of these benefits the ministers of the country might be emboldened were it necessary to apply funds of the state to the support of education on church principles <\s>
<s> before i conclude i cannot forbear noticing the strenuous efforts made at this time in parliament by so many persons to extend manufacturing and commercial industry at the expense of agricultural though we have recently had abundant proofs that the apprehensions expressed by the wanderer were not groundless <\s>
<s> i spake of mischief by the wise diffused with gladness thinking that the more it spreads the healthier the securer we become delusion which a moment may destroy <\s>

<s> but turned not without welcome promise given that he would share the pleasures and pursuits of yet another summer's day consumed in wandering with us <\s>
<s> when i reported this promise of the solitary and long after it was my wish and i might say intention that we should resume our wanderings and pass the borders into his native country where as i hoped he might witness in the society of the wanderer some religious ceremony a sacrament say in the open fields or a preaching among the mountains which by recalling to his mind the days of his early childhood when he had been present on such occasions in company with his parents and nearest kindred might have dissolved his heart into tenderness and so done more towards restoring the christian faith in which he had been educated and with that contentedness and even cheerfulness of mind than all that the wanderer and pastor by their several effusions and addresses had been enabled to effect <\s>

<s> westmoreland february 24 1818 <\s>
<s> i have not scrupled to express myself strongly on this subject perceiving what use is made by the opposite party of those resolutions of the house of commons <\s>
<s> in support of my opinion i quote the following from the carlisle patriot of the 14th of february premising with the author of the letter from which it is extracted that by far the greatest number of opulent landholders are members of the upper house and that the richest subjects are some of its peers the peers of great britain stripped as they now are of the overgrown importance which they derived from the feudal system have made no acquisition of political influence to compensate for the loss of it by an increasing extension of patronage either collectively or individually like the crown nor have the various circumstances operated upon their body in any considerable degree which have effected such a radical and powerful accumulation of consequence and importance in the lower house <\s>
<s> add to this that the general sentiment or feeling that commonly exists between them and the body of the people bears no analogy to the vivid principles of affectionate loyalty that tend so strongly to secure and guard the person and rights of the king or the reciprocal sympathy of congenial interests that acts and directs so powerfully betwixt the commons and the community in general <\s>
<s> on the contrary the spirit that exists betwixt the peers as a collectively distinct body and the people at large is a spirit of repulsion rather than of attraction <\s>
<s> in a corporate light they are viewed with no sentiments of kindly affection and therefore upon the supposition of a political contest betwixt them and either of the other two estates they would inevitably labour under the disadvantage of carrying it on against all the force of the prejudices which to a great extent always directs popular opinion hence amidst all the contests and straggles which have agitated or convulsed the kingdom since the reign of henry the seventh the political importance of the peers considered as an estate of parliament has been rather diminished than increased and were such a democratical house of commons as our modern patriots so loudly call for to be efficiently formed the constitutional equilibrium of our envied public system would be infallibly destroyed and the spirit of our legislative body which in a great measure awards influence in proportion to property completely abrogated and it is in vain to suppose that if even such a change was desirable it could possibly be effected without producing a train of incalculable miseries that would much more than overbalance any partial good which could reasonably be expected from the alteration .... <\s>
<s> as property then is incontestibly the foundation stone of political right in britain it follows as an inevitable consequence that the ratio of these rights should be in some measure commensurate to the extent of the property otherwise the immutable maxims of justice as well as the spirit of the constitution is violated for it would be palpably unjust to put a man who possessed a great stake in the welfare of the country and paid comparatively a greater proportion of its public revenue on a level with the inferior freeholders who not possessing any thing like an equal extent of property cannot possibly have the means of equally contributing to the exigencies of the state .... <\s>
<s> now if any considerate conscientious man will calmly reflect upon the power of the house of commons in the imposition of taxes and in how many ways the public burthen affects the landed interest either directly or indirectly he must acknowledge the expediency as well as the necessity and justice of the system which steadily though silently protects the great landholders in exercising an appropriate influence in the election of the representatives of the people phocion <\s>
<s> previous to the reign of henry the seventh the peers defended their property and their privileges through the means of armed retainers <\s>
<s> that politic prince by laws directed against the number of these retainers by bringing in use the making of leases and by statutes framed for the purpose of unfettering more easily the estates of his powerful nobility and laying them more open to alienation prepared the way for reducing the power of an order which had been too strong for the crown <\s>
<s> the operation of these laws in course of time would have brought the peers as an estate of the realm to utter insignificance had not the practice of supplying the peerage with new members through creation by patent without intervention of parliament been substituted for the only mode previously tolerated by the great barons for the exercise of this royal prerogative namely by authority of parliament <\s>
<s> thus did the consequence of the order notwithstanding the diminution of its power continue to be maintained rich commoners and royal favourites being introduced to supply the places of extinguished families or those whose wealth had fallen into decay <\s>
<s> this prerogative grew without immoderate exercise till the close of the reign of queen elizabeth <\s>
<s> the first of the stuarts employed it lavishly not considering the changes that had taken place <\s>
<s> his predecessors of the house of tudor by breaking down the feudal strength of the lords and by transfer through the reformation of the spiritual supremacy to themselves as temporal sovereigns had come into possession of a superfluity of power which enabled the crown to supply what was wanted in the peers for their own support <\s>
<s> but through remote operation of the same causes the commons were rising fast into consequence with a puritanical spirit of republicanism spreading rapidly amongst them <\s>
<s> hence the augmentation of the number of peers made by james the first notwithstanding the addition of property carried by it to the upper house did not add sufficient strength to that body to compensate for the distastefulness of the measure to the people and as far as the property of the new peers was but the creature of prodigal grants from the crown the conjoint strength of the two estates received no increase <\s>
<s> in the meanwhile surrenders were made of the power of the crown with infatuated facility till the commons became so strong that the right of creating boroughs being openly disputed was almost abandoned and the speedy consequence of the whole was that the two parliamentary estates of king and lords fell before the intemperance of the third <\s>
<s> after the restoration the disputes about the bounds of liberty and prerogative were revived but prerogative was gradually abandoned for the less obnoxious and less obvious operations of influence <\s>
<s> the numerous creations of peers were complained of but whatever motive might have governed those creations they were justified by the necessity of things <\s>
<s> large as were the additions made to the number of peers they were insufficient to give the house its due weight as a separate estate in the legislature <\s>
<s> through the reigns of charles william and anne whether the crown was disposed to tyranny or the commons were venal factious or arbitrary we see too many proofs of the lords wanting natural strength to maintain their rights and carry their patriotic wishes into effect even when they were supported by marked expressions of popular opinion in their favour <\s>
<s> if the changes which had taken place in the structure of society would have allowed them to act regularly as an independent body upon its intrinsic resources a deathblow was given to such expectation towards the close of the reign of queen anne when twelve peers were created in one day <\s>
<s> this act deservedly made one of the articles of impeachment against lord oxford shewed that their sentiments as a body were at the mercy of any unprincipled administration and compelled them to look about for some other means of being attended to and the most obvious was the best for the country and themselves that of taking care of and augmenting the influence which they possessed in the house of commons <\s>
<s> reformers plead against this practice constitutional resolutions still existing <\s>
<s> the slight review which has been given demonstrates its necessity if the constitution is to be preserved <\s>
<s> the only question which a practical politician can tolerate for a moment relates to the degree of this influence has it been carried too far <\s>

<s> see preface in the present volume for details on this letter which was addressed to the bishop of london blomfield <\s>
<s> this is printed from the original manuscript <\s>
<s> of the catholic relief bill 1829 <\s>
<s> my lord i have been hesitating for the space of a week whether i should take the liberty of addressing you but as the decision draws near my anxiety increases and i cannot refrain from intruding upon you for a few minutes <\s>
<s> i will try to be brief throwing myself upon your indulgence if what i have to say prove of little moment <\s>
<s> the question before us is can protestantism and popery or somewhat narrowing the ground can the church of england including that of ireland and the church of rome be co ordinate powers in the constitution of a free country and at the same time christian belief be in that country a vital principle of action <\s>
<s> the states of the continent afford no proof whatever that the existence of protestantism and romanism under the specified conditions is practicable nor can they be rationally referred to as furnishing a guide for us <\s>
<s> in france the most conspicuous of these states and the freest the number of protestants in comparison with catholics is insignificant and unbelief and superstition almost divide the country between them <\s>
<s> in prussia there is no legislative assembly the government is essentially military and excepting the countries upon the rhine recently added to that power the proportion of catholics is inconsiderable <\s>
<s> in hanover jacob speaks of the protestants as more than ten to one here indeed is a legislative assembly but its powers are ill defined <\s>
<s> hanover had and still may have a censorship of the press an indulgent one it can afford to be so through the sedative virtue of the standing army of the country and that of the germanic league to back the executive in case of commotion <\s>
<s> no sound minded englishman will build upon the short lived experience of the kingdom of the netherlands <\s>
<s> in flanders a benighted papacy prevails which defeated the attempts of the king to enlighten the people by education and i am well assured that the protestant portion of holland have small reason to be thankful for the footing upon which they have been there placed <\s>
<s> if that kingdom is to last there is great cause for fear that its government will incline more and more to romanism as the religion of a great majority of its subjects and as one which by its slavish spirit makes the people more manageable <\s>
<s> if so it is to be apprehended that protestantism will gradually disappear before it and the ruling classes in a still greater degree than they now are will become infidels as the easiest refuge in their own minds from the debasing doctrines of papacy <\s>
<s> three great conflicts 24 are before the progressive nations between christianity and infidelity between papacy and protestantism and between the spirit of the old feudal and monarchical governments and the representative and republican system as established in america <\s>
<s> the church of england in addition to her infidel and roman catholic assailants and the politicians of the anti feudal class has to contend with a formidable body of protestant dissenters <\s>
<s> amid these several and often combined attacks how is she to maintain herself <\s>
<s> from which of these enemies has she most to fear <\s>
<s> some are of opinion that papacy is less formidable than dissent whose bias is republican which is averse to monarchy to a hierarchy and to the tything system to all which romanism is strongly attached <\s>
<s> the abstract principles embodied in the creed of the dissenters catechism are without doubt full as politically dangerous as those of the romanists but fortunately their creed is not their practice <\s>
<s> they are divided among themselves they acknowledge no foreign jurisdiction their organisation and discipline are comparatively feeble and in times long past however powerful they proved themselves to overthrow they are not likely to be able to build up <\s>
<s> whatever the presbyterian form as in the church of scotland may have to recommend it we find that the sons of the nobility and gentry of scotland who choose the sacred profession almost invariably enter into the church of england and for the same reason viz <\s>
<s> the want of a hierarchy you will excuse me for connecting views so humiliating with divine truth the rich dissenters in the course of a generation or two fall into the bosom of our church <\s>
<s> as holding out attractions to the upper orders the church of england has no advantages over that of rome but rather the contrary <\s>
<s> the coadjutors of the obscure individuals who from a distance first excited this movement under a pretence of recovering your rights would have played the whirlwind among your property and crushed you less perhaps out of malice than because in their frenzy they could not help it <\s>

<s> my lord i have been hesitating for the space of a week whether i should take the liberty of addressing you but as the decision draws near my anxiety increases and i cannot refrain from intruding upon you for a few minutes <\s>
<s> i will try to be brief throwing myself upon your indulgence if what i have to say prove of little moment <\s>
<s> the question before us is can protestantism and popery or somewhat narrowing the ground can the church of england including that of ireland and the church of rome be co ordinate powers in the constitution of a free country and at the same time christian belief be in that country a vital principle of action <\s>
<s> the states of the continent afford no proof whatever that the existence of protestantism and romanism under the specified conditions is practicable nor can they be rationally referred to as furnishing a guide for us <\s>
<s> in france the most conspicuous of these states and the freest the number of protestants in comparison with catholics is insignificant and unbelief and superstition almost divide the country between them <\s>
<s> in prussia there is no legislative assembly the government is essentially military and excepting the countries upon the rhine recently added to that power the proportion of catholics is inconsiderable <\s>
<s> in hanover jacob speaks of the protestants as more than ten to one here indeed is a legislative assembly but its powers are ill defined <\s>
<s> hanover had and still may have a censorship of the press an indulgent one it can afford to be so through the sedative virtue of the standing army of the country and that of the germanic league to back the executive in case of commotion <\s>
<s> no sound minded englishman will build upon the short lived experience of the kingdom of the netherlands <\s>
<s> in flanders a benighted papacy prevails which defeated the attempts of the king to enlighten the people by education and i am well assured that the protestant portion of holland have small reason to be thankful for the footing upon which they have been there placed <\s>
<s> if that kingdom is to last there is great cause for fear that its government will incline more and more to romanism as the religion of a great majority of its subjects and as one which by its slavish spirit makes the people more manageable <\s>
<s> if so it is to be apprehended that protestantism will gradually disappear before it and the ruling classes in a still greater degree than they now are will become infidels as the easiest refuge in their own minds from the debasing doctrines of papacy <\s>
<s> three great conflicts 24 are before the progressive nations between christianity and infidelity between papacy and protestantism and between the spirit of the old feudal and monarchical governments and the representative and republican system as established in america <\s>
<s> the church of england in addition to her infidel and roman catholic assailants and the politicians of the anti feudal class has to contend with a formidable body of protestant dissenters <\s>
<s> amid these several and often combined attacks how is she to maintain herself <\s>
<s> from which of these enemies has she most to fear <\s>
<s> some are of opinion that papacy is less formidable than dissent whose bias is republican which is averse to monarchy to a hierarchy and to the tything system to all which romanism is strongly attached <\s>
<s> the abstract principles embodied in the creed of the dissenters catechism are without doubt full as politically dangerous as those of the romanists but fortunately their creed is not their practice <\s>
<s> they are divided among themselves they acknowledge no foreign jurisdiction their organisation and discipline are comparatively feeble and in times long past however powerful they proved themselves to overthrow they are not likely to be able to build up <\s>
<s> whatever the presbyterian form as in the church of scotland may have to recommend it we find that the sons of the nobility and gentry of scotland who choose the sacred profession almost invariably enter into the church of england and for the same reason viz <\s>
<s> the want of a hierarchy you will excuse me for connecting views so humiliating with divine truth the rich dissenters in the course of a generation or two fall into the bosom of our church <\s>
<s> as holding out attractions to the upper orders the church of england has no advantages over that of rome but rather the contrary <\s>
<s> the coadjutors of the obscure individuals who from a distance first excited this movement under a pretence of recovering your rights would have played the whirlwind among your property and crushed you less perhaps out of malice than because in their frenzy they could not help it <\s>
<s> a conviction that the subject is ill understood by those who were unprepared for what has just been said is the excuse to my own mind gentlemen for having made so protracted a demand upon your attention <\s>
<s> the ruinous tendencies of this self flattering enterprize can only be checked by timely and general foresight <\s>
<s> the contest in which we are engaged has been described by persons noticing it from a distance as the work of a cabal of electioneering jobbers who have contrived to set up the thanet against the lowther interests that both parties might spend their money for the benefit of those who cared for neither <\s>
<s> the thanet interest in the county of westmoreland one might almost as well talk of an interest in the moon <\s>
<s> the descendant of the cliffords has not thought it worth while to recommend himself to the electors by the course either of his public or his private life and therefore though his purse may have weight and his possessions are considerable he himself in reference to the supposed object is nothing <\s>
<s> if this had been really an attempt made by a numerous body of malcontent freeholders to carry their wishes for a change into effect by placing at their head some approved chief of an ancient family possessed of real consequence in the county the proceeding considered in the abstract could not have been objected to <\s>
<s> this county is and ever was open to fair and honourable contest originating in principles sanctioned by general practice and carried on by means which if universally adopted would not be injurious to the state <\s>
<s> but the present measure stands not upon any such grounds it is an attempt no matter with what ultimate view to effect a total change in the character of county elections beginning here with the expectation as is openly avowed of being imitated elsewhere <\s>
<s> it reverses the order hitherto pursued <\s>
<s> instead of aiming to influence the less wealthy and less instructed freeholders through the medium of those whom they have been accustomed to confide in instead of descending by legitimate gradations from high to lower from the well instructed and widely experienced to those who have not had equal advantages it commences at the bottom far beneath the degree of the poorest freeholders and works upwards with an inflammatory appeal to feelings that owe their birth to previous mistatement of facts <\s>
<s> opulence rank station privilege distinction intellectual culture the notions naturally following upon these in a country like england are protection succour guidance example dissemination of knowledge introduction of improvements and all the benefits and blessings that among freemen are diffused where authority like the parental from a sense of community of interest and the natural goodness of mankind is softened into brotherly concern <\s>
<s> this is no utopian picture of the characteristics of elevated rank wealth competence and learned and liberal education in england for with the liberty of speech and writing that prevails amongst us if such rays of light and love did not generally emanate from superiority of station possessions and accomplishment the frame of society which we behold could not subsist <\s>
<s> yes in spite of pride hardness of heart grasping avarice and other selfish passions the not unfrequent concomitants of affluence and worldly prosperity the mass of the people are justly dealt with and tenderly cherished accordingly gratitude without servility dispositions to prompt return of service undebased by officiousness and respectful attachment that with small prejudice to the understanding greatly enriches the heart such are the sentiments with which englishmen of the humblest condition have been accustomed to look up towards their friends and benefactors <\s>
<s> among the holders of fixed property whether labourers in the field or artisans ); among those who are fortunate enough to have an interest in the soil of their country these human sentiments of civil life are strengthened by additional dependencies i am aware how much universal habits of rapacious speculation occasioned by fluctuations in the value of produce during the late war how much the spread of manufactories and the baleful operation of the poor laws have done to impair these indigenous and salutary affections <\s>
<s> i am conscious of the sad deterioration and no one can lament it more deeply but sufficient vitality is left in the stock of ancient virtue to furnish hope that by careful manuring and skilful application of the knife to the withered branches fresh shoots might thrive in their place were it not for the base artifices of malignants who pretending to invigorate the tree pour scalding water and corrosive compounds among its roots so that the fibres are killed in the mould by which they have been nourished <\s>
<s> that for years such artifices have been employed in westmoreland and in a neighbouring county with unremitting activity must be known to all <\s>
<s> whatever was disliked has been systematically attacked by the vilifying of persons connected with it <\s>
<s> the magistrates and public functionaries up to the lord lieutenant himself have been regularly traduced as unfaithful to their trust the clergy habitually derided as time servers and slavish dependants and the gentry if conspicuous for attachment to the government stigmatized as men without honour or patriotism and leagued in conspiracy against the poor <\s>
<s> after this manner have the provincial newspapers the chief agents in this local mischief concurred with the disaffected london journals who were playing the same part towards laws and institutions and general measures of state by calumniating the principal authorities of the kingdom <\s>
<s> hence instead of gratitude and love and confidence and hope are resentment and envy mistrust and jealousy and hatred and rancour inspired and the drift of all is to impress the body of the people with a belief that neither justice can be expected nor benevolence hoped for unless power be transferred to persons least resembling those who now hold it that is to demagogues and incendiaries <\s>
<s> it will be thought that this attempt is too extravagant to be dangerous inasmuch as every member of society possessed of weight and authority must revolt from such a transfer and abhor the issues to which it points <\s>
<s> possessed of weight and authority with whom <\s>
<s> these agitators have weight and authority there where they seek for it that is with no small portion of what they term the physical strength of the country <\s>
<s> the people have ever been the dupes of extremes <\s>
<s> vast gains with little pains is a jingle of words that would be an appropriate inscription for the insurrectionary banner of unthinking humanity <\s>
<s> to walk to wind towards a thing that is coveted how unattractive an operation compared with leaping upon it at once certainly no one possessed of legitimate authority can desire such a transfer as we have been forced to contemplate but he may aid in bringing it about without desiring it <\s>
<s> numerous are the courses of civil action in which men of pure dispositions and honourable aims are tempted to take part with those who are utterly destitute of both <\s>
<s> be not startled if merely glancing at the causes of this deplorable union as it is now exhibited in this part of england i observe that there is no necessary connection between public spirit and political sagacity <\s>
<s> how often does it happen that right intention is averse to inquiry as casting a damp upon its own zeal and a suspicion upon the intrinsic recommendation of its object <\s>
<s> good men turn instinctively from inferences unfavourable to human nature <\s>
<s> but there are facts which are not to be resisted where the understanding is sound <\s>
<s> the self styled emancipators have tried their strength if there were any thing promising to england in their efforts we should have seen this country arrayed in opposite parties resembling each other in quality and composition <\s>
<s> little of that appears <\s>
<s> the promoters of the struggle did not hope for such a result and many of them would not have wished for it could they have expected to be carried through by that ruinous division of the upper from the lower ranks of society on which they mainly relied <\s>
<s> but freeholders wicked devices have not done the service that was expected from them <\s>
<s> you are upon your guard the result of this canvass has already shewn that a vast majority of you are proof against assault and remain of sound mind <\s>
<s> such example of men abiding by the rules of their forefathers cannot but encourage others who yet hesitate to determine in favour of the good cause <\s>
<s> the more signal the victory the greater will be the honour paid to fixed and true principles and the firmer our security against the recurrence of like innovations <\s>
<s> at all events enough i trust has been effected by the friends of our present representatives to protect those who have been deceived and may not in time awaken from their delusion <\s>
<s> may their eyes be opened and at no distant day so that perceiving the benefits which the laws as now enacted and administered ensure to their native land they may feel towards you who make the wiser choice the gratitude which you will have deserved the beginnings of great troubles are mostly of comparative insignificance a little spark can kindle a mighty conflagration and a small leak will suffice to sink a stately vessel <\s>
<s> to that loyal decision of the event now pending which may be confidently expected britain may owe the continuance of her tranquillity and freedom the maintenance of the justice and equity for which she is pre eminent among nations and the preservation of her social comforts her charitable propensities her morals and her religion <\s>
<s> of this as belonging to the future we cannot speak with certainty but not a doubt can exist that the practices which led to the destruction of all that was venerable in a neighbouring country have upon this occasion been industriously unscrupulously eagerly resorted to but my last words shall be words of congratulation and thanksgiving upon a bright prospect that the wishes will be crossed and the endeavours frustrated of those amongst us who without their own knowledge were ready to relinquish every good which they and we possess by uniting with overweening reformers to compose the vanguard of a ferocious revolution <\s>
<s> westmoreland february 24 1818 <\s>
<s> i have not scrupled to express myself strongly on this subject perceiving what use is made by the opposite party of those resolutions of the house of commons <\s>
<s> in support of my opinion i quote the following from the carlisle patriot of the 14th of february premising with the author of the letter from which it is extracted that by far the greatest number of opulent landholders are members of the upper house and that the richest subjects are some of its peers the peers of great britain stripped as they now are of the overgrown importance which they derived from the feudal system have made no acquisition of political influence to compensate for the loss of it by an increasing extension of patronage either collectively or individually like the crown nor have the various circumstances operated upon their body in any considerable degree which have effected such a radical and powerful accumulation of consequence and importance in the lower house <\s>
<s> add to this that the general sentiment or feeling that commonly exists between them and the body of the people bears no analogy to the vivid principles of affectionate loyalty that tend so strongly to secure and guard the person and rights of the king or the reciprocal sympathy of congenial interests that acts and directs so powerfully betwixt the commons and the community in general <\s>
<s> on the contrary the spirit that exists betwixt the peers as a collectively distinct body and the people at large is a spirit of repulsion rather than of attraction <\s>
<s> in a corporate light they are viewed with no sentiments of kindly affection and therefore upon the supposition of a political contest betwixt them and either of the other two estates they would inevitably labour under the disadvantage of carrying it on against all the force of the prejudices which to a great extent always directs popular opinion hence amidst all the contests and straggles which have agitated or convulsed the kingdom since the reign of henry the seventh the political importance of the peers considered as an estate of parliament has been rather diminished than increased and were such a democratical house of commons as our modern patriots so loudly call for to be efficiently formed the constitutional equilibrium of our envied public system would be infallibly destroyed and the spirit of our legislative body which in a great measure awards influence in proportion to property completely abrogated and it is in vain to suppose that if even such a change was desirable it could possibly be effected without producing a train of incalculable miseries that would much more than overbalance any partial good which could reasonably be expected from the alteration .... <\s>
<s> as property then is incontestibly the foundation stone of political right in britain it follows as an inevitable consequence that the ratio of these rights should be in some measure commensurate to the extent of the property otherwise the immutable maxims of justice as well as the spirit of the constitution is violated for it would be palpably unjust to put a man who possessed a great stake in the welfare of the country and paid comparatively a greater proportion of its public revenue on a level with the inferior freeholders who not possessing any thing like an equal extent of property cannot possibly have the means of equally contributing to the exigencies of the state .... <\s>
<s> now if any considerate conscientious man will calmly reflect upon the power of the house of commons in the imposition of taxes and in how many ways the public burthen affects the landed interest either directly or indirectly he must acknowledge the expediency as well as the necessity and justice of the system which steadily though silently protects the great landholders in exercising an appropriate influence in the election of the representatives of the people phocion <\s>
<s> previous to the reign of henry the seventh the peers defended their property and their privileges through the means of armed retainers <\s>
<s> that politic prince by laws directed against the number of these retainers by bringing in use the making of leases and by statutes framed for the purpose of unfettering more easily the estates of his powerful nobility and laying them more open to alienation prepared the way for reducing the power of an order which had been too strong for the crown <\s>
<s> the operation of these laws in course of time would have brought the peers as an estate of the realm to utter insignificance had not the practice of supplying the peerage with new members through creation by patent without intervention of parliament been substituted for the only mode previously tolerated by the great barons for the exercise of this royal prerogative namely by authority of parliament <\s>
<s> thus did the consequence of the order notwithstanding the diminution of its power continue to be maintained rich commoners and royal favourites being introduced to supply the places of extinguished families or those whose wealth had fallen into decay <\s>
<s> this prerogative grew without immoderate exercise till the close of the reign of queen elizabeth <\s>
<s> the first of the stuarts employed it lavishly not considering the changes that had taken place <\s>
<s> his predecessors of the house of tudor by breaking down the feudal strength of the lords and by transfer through the reformation of the spiritual supremacy to themselves as temporal sovereigns had come into possession of a superfluity of power which enabled the crown to supply what was wanted in the peers for their own support <\s>
<s> but through remote operation of the same causes the commons were rising fast into consequence with a puritanical spirit of republicanism spreading rapidly amongst them <\s>
<s> hence the augmentation of the number of peers made by james the first notwithstanding the addition of property carried by it to the upper house did not add sufficient strength to that body to compensate for the distastefulness of the measure to the people and as far as the property of the new peers was but the creature of prodigal grants from the crown the conjoint strength of the two estates received no increase <\s>

<s> till that time comes it will not grieve us that this county should supply two representatives to uphold the servants of the crown even if both should continue through unavoidable circumstances to issue from one family amongst us <\s>
<s> till that change takes place we will treat with scorn the senseless outcry for the recovery of an independence which has never been lost <\s>
<s> we are have been and will remain independent and the host of men respectable on every account who have publicly avowed their desire to maintain our present representatives in their seats deem it insolence to assert the contrary <\s>
<s> they are independent in every rational sense of the word acknowledging however that they rest upon a principle and are incorporated with an interest and this they regard as a proof that their affections are sane and their understandings superior to illusion <\s>
<s> but in certain vocabularies liberty is synonymous with licence and to be free as explained by some is to live and act without restraint <\s>
<s> in like manner independence according to the meaning of their interpretation is the explosive energy of conceit making blind havoc with expediency <\s>
<s> it is a presumptuous spirit at war with all the passive worth of mankind <\s>
<s> the independence which they boast of despises habit and time honoured forms of subordination it consists in breaking old ties upon new temptations in casting off the modest garb of private obligation to strut about in the glittering armour of public virtue in sacrificing with jacobinical infatuation the near to the remote and preferring to what has been known and tried that which has no distinct existence even in imagination in renouncing with voluble tongue and vain heart every thing intricate in motive and mixed in quality in a downright passion of love for absolute unapproachable patriotism <\s>
<s> in short the independence these reformers bawl for is the worthy precursor of the liberty they adore making her first essay by starting out of the course for the pleasure of falling into the ditch and asserting her heaven born vigour by soaring above the level of humanity in profession that it may more conspicuously appear how far she can fall below it in practice <\s>
<s> to this spurious independence the friends of our present representatives lay no claim <\s>
<s> they assert in the face of the world that those representatives hold their seats by free election that has placed them there and why should we wish to change what we do not disapprove of that which could not have been without our approbation <\s>

<s> brougham had not individually passed far beyond the line of that party if his conduct had been such that even they themselves would admit that he truly belonged to them the exception would still lie against the general rule and will remain till the character of men and measures materially changes for the better assuredly on the one side if not for the worse on the other <\s>
<s> remember what england might have been with an administration countenancing french doctrines at the dawn of the french revolution and suffering them as it advanced to be sown with every wind that came across the channel <\s>
<s> think what was the state of europe before the french emperor the apparent and in too many respects the real idol of opposition was overthrown <\s>
<s> numbers i am aware do not cease vehemently to maintain that the late war was neither just nor necessary that the ostensible and real causes of it were widely different that it was not begun and persisted in for the purpose of withstanding foreign aggression and in defence of social order but from unprincipled ambition in the powers of europe eager to seize that opportunity of augmenting their territories at the expence of distracted and enfeebled france events ever to be lamented do i grant give too much colour to those affirmations <\s>
<s> but this was a war upon a large scale wherein many belligerents took part and no one who distinctly remembers the state of europe at its commencement will be inclined any more to question that the alleged motives had a solid foundation because then or afterwards others might mix with them than he would doubt that the maintenance of christianity and the reduction of the power of the infidels were the principal motives of the crusades because roving adventurers joining in those expeditions turned them to their own profit <\s>
<s> traders and hypocrites may make part of a caravan bound to mecca but it does not follow that a religious observance is not the prime object of the pilgrimage <\s>
<s> the political fanaticism it deserves no milder name that pervaded the manifesto issued by the duke of brunswick on his entry into france proves that he and the power whose organ he was were swayed on their march by an ambition very different from that of territorial aggrandizement at least if such ambition existed it is plain that feelings of another kind blinded them to the means of gratifying it <\s>
<s> nevertheless we must acknowledge the passion soon manifested itself and in a quarter where it was least excusable <\s>
<s> the seizure of valenciennes in the name of the emperor of germany was an act of such glaring rapacity and gave the lie so unfeelingly to all that had been professed that the then ministers of great britain doubtless opposed the intention with a strong remonstrance <\s>
<s> but the dictates of magnanimity which in such cases is but another word for high and sage policy would have been 'this unjust act must either be abandoned or great britain shall retire from a contest which if such principles are to govern or interfere with the conduct of it cannot but be calamitous <\s>
<s> a threat to this purpose was either not given or not acted upon <\s>
<s> from that moment the alliance of the french loyalists with the coalesced powers seemed to have no ground of rational patriotism to stand upon <\s>
<s> their professed helpers became their worst enemies and numbers among them not only began to wish for the defeat of their false friends but joined themselves to their fellow countrymen of all parties who were labouring to effect it but the military successes of the french arising mainly from this want of principle in the confederate powers in course of time placed the policy and justice of the war upon a new footing <\s>
<s> however men might differ about the necessity or reasonableness of resorting to arms in the first instance things were brought to such a state that among the disinterested and dispassionate there could be but one opinion even if nothing higher than security was aimed at on the demand for the utmost strength of the nation being put forth in the prosecution of the war till it should assume a more hopeful aspect and now it was that ministers made ample amends for past subserviency to selfish coadjutors and proved themselves worthy of being entrusted with the fate of europe <\s>
<s> while the opposition were taking counsel from their fears and recommending despair while they continued to magnify without scruple the strength of the enemy and to expose misrepresent and therefore increase the weaknesses of their country his majesty's ministers were not daunted though often discouraged they struggled up against adversity with fortitude and persevered heroically throwing themselves upon the honour and wisdom of the country and trusting for the issue to the decrees of a just providence and for this determination everlasting gratitude will attend them <\s>
<s> from the internal situation of france produced by the revolution war with the contiguous powers was inevitable sooner or later the evil must have been encountered and it was of little importance whether england took a share in it somewhat earlier than by fallible judgments might be deemed necessary or not <\s>
<s> the frankness with which the faults that were committed have been acknowledged entitles the writer to some regard when speaking from an intimate knowledge of the internal state of france at that time he affirms that the war waged against her was in a liberal interpretation of the words just and necessary <\s>
<s> at all events our nation viewed it in this light <\s>
<s> a large majority of the inhabitants of great britain called for the war and they who will the end will the means the war being deemed necessary taxes became indispensible for its support <\s>
<s> some might prefer one mode of raising them some another but these are minor considerations <\s>
<s> public men united in bodies must act on great principles <\s>
<s> mutual deference is a fundamental requisite for the composition and efficiency of a party for if individual judgment is to be obtruded and insisted upon in subordinate concerns the march of business will be perpetually obstructed <\s>
<s> the leaders will not know whom they can depend upon and therefore will be at a loss what to recommend and how to act <\s>
<s> if a public man differs from his party in essentials conscience and honour demand that he should withdraw but if there be no such difference it is incumbent upon him to submit his personal opinion to the general sense <\s>
<s> he therefore who thought the prosecution of the war necessary could not condemn the public imposts on this consequence the steady adherents of ministers rest their claim to approbation and advance it boldly in defiance of the outcry raised against the government on account of the burthens which the situation of europe compelled it to lay upon the people <\s>
<s> in matters of taste it is a process attended with little advantage and often injurious to compare one set of artists or writers with another <\s>
<s> but in estimating the merits of public men especially of two parties acting in direct opposition it is not only expedient but indispensible that both should be kept constantly in sight <\s>
<s> the truth or fallacy of french principles and the tendency good or bad of the revolution which sprang out of them and the necessity or non necessity the policy or impolicy of resisting by war the encroachments of republican and imperial france these were the opposite grounds upon which each party staked their credit here we behold them in full contrast with each other to whom shall the crown be given <\s>
<s> on whom has the light fallen <\s>
<s> and who are covered by shade and thick darkness <\s>
<s> the magnanimity which resolved that for principle's sake no efforts should be spared to crush a bestial despotism was acknowledged by every manly spirit whom party degenerating into faction had not vitiated <\s>
<s> that such was the dictate of confiding wisdom had long been inwardly felt and the prudence of the course was evinced by the triumphant issue but to the very completeness of this triumph may be indirectly attributed no small portion of the obloquy how heaped upon those advisers through whom it was achieved <\s>
<s> the power of napoleon buonaparte was overthrown his person has disappeared from the theatre of europe his name has almost deserted the columns of her daily and weekly journals but as he has left no successor as there is no foreign tyrant of sufficient importance to attract hatred by exciting fear many honest english patriots must either find or set up something at home for the employment of those affections <\s>

<s> till that time comes it will not grieve us that this county should supply two representatives to uphold the servants of the crown even if both should continue through unavoidable circumstances to issue from one family amongst us <\s>
<s> till that change takes place we will treat with scorn the senseless outcry for the recovery of an independence which has never been lost <\s>
<s> we are have been and will remain independent and the host of men respectable on every account who have publicly avowed their desire to maintain our present representatives in their seats deem it insolence to assert the contrary <\s>
<s> they are independent in every rational sense of the word acknowledging however that they rest upon a principle and are incorporated with an interest and this they regard as a proof that their affections are sane and their understandings superior to illusion <\s>
<s> but in certain vocabularies liberty is synonymous with licence and to be free as explained by some is to live and act without restraint <\s>
<s> in like manner independence according to the meaning of their interpretation is the explosive energy of conceit making blind havoc with expediency <\s>
<s> it is a presumptuous spirit at war with all the passive worth of mankind <\s>
<s> the independence which they boast of despises habit and time honoured forms of subordination it consists in breaking old ties upon new temptations in casting off the modest garb of private obligation to strut about in the glittering armour of public virtue in sacrificing with jacobinical infatuation the near to the remote and preferring to what has been known and tried that which has no distinct existence even in imagination in renouncing with voluble tongue and vain heart every thing intricate in motive and mixed in quality in a downright passion of love for absolute unapproachable patriotism <\s>
<s> in short the independence these reformers bawl for is the worthy precursor of the liberty they adore making her first essay by starting out of the course for the pleasure of falling into the ditch and asserting her heaven born vigour by soaring above the level of humanity in profession that it may more conspicuously appear how far she can fall below it in practice <\s>
<s> to this spurious independence the friends of our present representatives lay no claim <\s>
<s> they assert in the face of the world that those representatives hold their seats by free election that has placed them there and why should we wish to change what we do not disapprove of that which could not have been without our approbation <\s>

<s> gentlemen much of my former address originated in deference to that sense of right which is inseparable from the minds of enlightened patriots <\s>
<s> passing from local considerations i wrote under a belief that whatever personal or family leanings might prevail among you you would be moved by a wish to see the supporters of his majesty's ministers and their opponents possessed relatively to each other of that degree of strength which might render both parties in their several capacities most serviceable to the state <\s>
<s> i noticed that this just proportion of strength no longer remained and shewed that the opposition had caused it to be destroyed by holding from the beginning of the french revolution such a course as introduced in parliament discord among themselves deprived them in that house and elsewhere of the respect which from their adversaries they had been accustomed to command turned indifferent persons into enemies and alienated throughout the island the affections of thousands who had been proud to unite with them <\s>
<s> this weakness and degradation deplored by all true friends of the commonweal was sufficiently accounted for without even adverting to the fact that when the disasters of the war had induced the country to forgive and in some degree to forget the alarming attachment of that party to french theories and power heightened by the popularity of hope and expectation was thrown into their hands they disgusted even bigotted adherents by the rapacious use they made of that power stooping to so many offensive compromises and committing so many faults in every department that a government of talents if such be the fruits of talent was proved to be the most mischievous sort of government which england had ever been troubled with <\s>

<s> remember what england might have been with an administration countenancing french doctrines at the dawn of the french revolution and suffering them as it advanced to be sown with every wind that came across the channel <\s>
<s> think what was the state of europe before the french emperor the apparent and in too many respects the real idol of opposition was overthrown <\s>
<s> numbers i am aware do not cease vehemently to maintain that the late war was neither just nor necessary that the ostensible and real causes of it were widely different that it was not begun and persisted in for the purpose of withstanding foreign aggression and in defence of social order but from unprincipled ambition in the powers of europe eager to seize that opportunity of augmenting their territories at the expence of distracted and enfeebled france events ever to be lamented do i grant give too much colour to those affirmations <\s>
<s> but this was a war upon a large scale wherein many belligerents took part and no one who distinctly remembers the state of europe at its commencement will be inclined any more to question that the alleged motives had a solid foundation because then or afterwards others might mix with them than he would doubt that the maintenance of christianity and the reduction of the power of the infidels were the principal motives of the crusades because roving adventurers joining in those expeditions turned them to their own profit <\s>
<s> traders and hypocrites may make part of a caravan bound to mecca but it does not follow that a religious observance is not the prime object of the pilgrimage <\s>
<s> the political fanaticism it deserves no milder name that pervaded the manifesto issued by the duke of brunswick on his entry into france proves that he and the power whose organ he was were swayed on their march by an ambition very different from that of territorial aggrandizement at least if such ambition existed it is plain that feelings of another kind blinded them to the means of gratifying it <\s>
<s> nevertheless we must acknowledge the passion soon manifested itself and in a quarter where it was least excusable <\s>
<s> the seizure of valenciennes in the name of the emperor of germany was an act of such glaring rapacity and gave the lie so unfeelingly to all that had been professed that the then ministers of great britain doubtless opposed the intention with a strong remonstrance <\s>
<s> but the dictates of magnanimity which in such cases is but another word for high and sage policy would have been 'this unjust act must either be abandoned or great britain shall retire from a contest which if such principles are to govern or interfere with the conduct of it cannot but be calamitous <\s>
<s> a threat to this purpose was either not given or not acted upon <\s>
<s> from that moment the alliance of the french loyalists with the coalesced powers seemed to have no ground of rational patriotism to stand upon <\s>
<s> their professed helpers became their worst enemies and numbers among them not only began to wish for the defeat of their false friends but joined themselves to their fellow countrymen of all parties who were labouring to effect it but the military successes of the french arising mainly from this want of principle in the confederate powers in course of time placed the policy and justice of the war upon a new footing <\s>
<s> however men might differ about the necessity or reasonableness of resorting to arms in the first instance things were brought to such a state that among the disinterested and dispassionate there could be but one opinion even if nothing higher than security was aimed at on the demand for the utmost strength of the nation being put forth in the prosecution of the war till it should assume a more hopeful aspect and now it was that ministers made ample amends for past subserviency to selfish coadjutors and proved themselves worthy of being entrusted with the fate of europe <\s>
<s> while the opposition were taking counsel from their fears and recommending despair while they continued to magnify without scruple the strength of the enemy and to expose misrepresent and therefore increase the weaknesses of their country his majesty's ministers were not daunted though often discouraged they struggled up against adversity with fortitude and persevered heroically throwing themselves upon the honour and wisdom of the country and trusting for the issue to the decrees of a just providence and for this determination everlasting gratitude will attend them <\s>
<s> from the internal situation of france produced by the revolution war with the contiguous powers was inevitable sooner or later the evil must have been encountered and it was of little importance whether england took a share in it somewhat earlier than by fallible judgments might be deemed necessary or not <\s>
<s> the frankness with which the faults that were committed have been acknowledged entitles the writer to some regard when speaking from an intimate knowledge of the internal state of france at that time he affirms that the war waged against her was in a liberal interpretation of the words just and necessary <\s>
<s> at all events our nation viewed it in this light <\s>
<s> a large majority of the inhabitants of great britain called for the war and they who will the end will the means the war being deemed necessary taxes became indispensible for its support <\s>
<s> some might prefer one mode of raising them some another but these are minor considerations <\s>
<s> public men united in bodies must act on great principles <\s>
<s> mutual deference is a fundamental requisite for the composition and efficiency of a party for if individual judgment is to be obtruded and insisted upon in subordinate concerns the march of business will be perpetually obstructed <\s>
<s> the leaders will not know whom they can depend upon and therefore will be at a loss what to recommend and how to act <\s>
<s> if a public man differs from his party in essentials conscience and honour demand that he should withdraw but if there be no such difference it is incumbent upon him to submit his personal opinion to the general sense <\s>
<s> he therefore who thought the prosecution of the war necessary could not condemn the public imposts on this consequence the steady adherents of ministers rest their claim to approbation and advance it boldly in defiance of the outcry raised against the government on account of the burthens which the situation of europe compelled it to lay upon the people <\s>
<s> in matters of taste it is a process attended with little advantage and often injurious to compare one set of artists or writers with another <\s>
<s> but in estimating the merits of public men especially of two parties acting in direct opposition it is not only expedient but indispensible that both should be kept constantly in sight <\s>
<s> the truth or fallacy of french principles and the tendency good or bad of the revolution which sprang out of them and the necessity or non necessity the policy or impolicy of resisting by war the encroachments of republican and imperial france these were the opposite grounds upon which each party staked their credit here we behold them in full contrast with each other to whom shall the crown be given <\s>
<s> on whom has the light fallen <\s>
<s> and who are covered by shade and thick darkness <\s>
<s> the magnanimity which resolved that for principle's sake no efforts should be spared to crush a bestial despotism was acknowledged by every manly spirit whom party degenerating into faction had not vitiated <\s>
<s> that such was the dictate of confiding wisdom had long been inwardly felt and the prudence of the course was evinced by the triumphant issue but to the very completeness of this triumph may be indirectly attributed no small portion of the obloquy how heaped upon those advisers through whom it was achieved <\s>
<s> the power of napoleon buonaparte was overthrown his person has disappeared from the theatre of europe his name has almost deserted the columns of her daily and weekly journals but as he has left no successor as there is no foreign tyrant of sufficient importance to attract hatred by exciting fear many honest english patriots must either find or set up something at home for the employment of those affections <\s>
<s> this is too natural to occasion surprise thousands are so framed that they are but languidly conscious of their love of an object unless while they feel themselves in an active state of aversion to something which they can regard as its opposite thus we see men who had been proud of their attachment to his majesty's ministers during the awful struggle as soon as it was over allowing on the first temptation that proud attachment to be converted into immoderate suspicion and a long experienced gratitude into sudden alienation through this infirmity many were betrayed into taking part with the men whom they had heretofore despised or condemned and assisted them in reviling their own government for suffering among the states of the continent institutions to remain which the respective nations surely the best if not the only judges in the case were unwilling to part with and for having permitted things to be done either just and proper in themselves or if indeed abuses abuses of that kind which great britain had neither right to oppose nor power to prevent <\s>
<s> not a frenchman is in arms in spain <\s>
<s> but alas for the credit of the english cabinet ferdinand though a lawful appears to be a sorry king and the inquisition though venerated by the people of spain as a holy tribunal which has spread a protecting shade over their religion for hundreds of years is among protestants an abomination <\s>

<s> if it be praiseworthy to have contributed to cast shoals of our deserving countrymen adrift without regard to their past services that praise cannot be denied him if it be commendable to have availed himself of inordinate momentary passion to carry measures whereby the general weal was sacrificed whether designedly for the attainment of popularity or in the self applauding sincerity of a heated mind that praise is due to mr <\s>
<s> brougham and his coadjutors <\s>
<s> but to the judicious freeholders of westmoreland whether gentry or yeomanry rich or poor he will in vain adduce this or any other part of the recent conduct of opposition as a motive for strengthening their interests amongst us <\s>
<s> no freeholders we must wait assuring them that they shall have a reasonable portion of our support as soon as they have proved that they deserve it <\s>
<s> till that time comes it will not grieve us that this county should supply two representatives to uphold the servants of the crown even if both should continue through unavoidable circumstances to issue from one family amongst us <\s>
<s> till that change takes place we will treat with scorn the senseless outcry for the recovery of an independence which has never been lost <\s>
<s> we are have been and will remain independent and the host of men respectable on every account who have publicly avowed their desire to maintain our present representatives in their seats deem it insolence to assert the contrary <\s>
<s> they are independent in every rational sense of the word acknowledging however that they rest upon a principle and are incorporated with an interest and this they regard as a proof that their affections are sane and their understandings superior to illusion <\s>
<s> but in certain vocabularies liberty is synonymous with licence and to be free as explained by some is to live and act without restraint <\s>
<s> in like manner independence according to the meaning of their interpretation is the explosive energy of conceit making blind havoc with expediency <\s>
<s> it is a presumptuous spirit at war with all the passive worth of mankind <\s>
<s> the independence which they boast of despises habit and time honoured forms of subordination it consists in breaking old ties upon new temptations in casting off the modest garb of private obligation to strut about in the glittering armour of public virtue in sacrificing with jacobinical infatuation the near to the remote and preferring to what has been known and tried that which has no distinct existence even in imagination in renouncing with voluble tongue and vain heart every thing intricate in motive and mixed in quality in a downright passion of love for absolute unapproachable patriotism <\s>
<s> in short the independence these reformers bawl for is the worthy precursor of the liberty they adore making her first essay by starting out of the course for the pleasure of falling into the ditch and asserting her heaven born vigour by soaring above the level of humanity in profession that it may more conspicuously appear how far she can fall below it in practice <\s>
<s> to this spurious independence the friends of our present representatives lay no claim <\s>
<s> they assert in the face of the world that those representatives hold their seats by free election that has placed them there and why should we wish to change what we do not disapprove of that which could not have been without our approbation <\s>
<s> but this county has not for a long time been disturbed by electioneering contests is there no species of choice then but that which is accompanied with commotion and clamour <\s>
<s> do silent acquiescence and deliberate consent pass for nothing <\s>
<s> being contented what could we seek for more <\s>
<s> being satisfied why should we stir for stirring's sake <\s>
<s> uproar and disorder even these we could tolerate on a justifying occasion but it is no sign of prudence to court them unnecessarily nor of temper to invite them wantonly <\s>
<s> he who resorts to substantial unruliness for the redress of imaginary grievances provokes certain mischief and often in the end produces calamity which would excite little compassion could it be confined to its original author <\s>
<s> let those who think that they are degraded proclaim their own dishonour <\s>
<s> gentlemen much of my former address originated in deference to that sense of right which is inseparable from the minds of enlightened patriots <\s>
<s> passing from local considerations i wrote under a belief that whatever personal or family leanings might prevail among you you would be moved by a wish to see the supporters of his majesty's ministers and their opponents possessed relatively to each other of that degree of strength which might render both parties in their several capacities most serviceable to the state <\s>
<s> i noticed that this just proportion of strength no longer remained and shewed that the opposition had caused it to be destroyed by holding from the beginning of the french revolution such a course as introduced in parliament discord among themselves deprived them in that house and elsewhere of the respect which from their adversaries they had been accustomed to command turned indifferent persons into enemies and alienated throughout the island the affections of thousands who had been proud to unite with them <\s>
<s> this weakness and degradation deplored by all true friends of the commonweal was sufficiently accounted for without even adverting to the fact that when the disasters of the war had induced the country to forgive and in some degree to forget the alarming attachment of that party to french theories and power heightened by the popularity of hope and expectation was thrown into their hands they disgusted even bigotted adherents by the rapacious use they made of that power stooping to so many offensive compromises and committing so many faults in every department that a government of talents if such be the fruits of talent was proved to be the most mischievous sort of government which england had ever been troubled with <\s>
<s> so that whether in or out of place an evil genius seemed to attend them <\s>
<s> how could all this happen <\s>
<s> for the fundamental reason that neither the religion the laws the morals the manners nor the literature of the country especially as contrasted with those of france were prized by the leaders of the party as they deserved <\s>
<s> it is a notorious fact that among their personal friends was scarcely to be found a single clergyman of distinction so that how to dispose of their ecclesiastical patronage in a manner that might do them credit they were almost as ignorant as strangers landed for the first time in a foreign country <\s>
<s> this is not to be accounted for on any supposition since the education of men of rank naturally devolves on those members of our universities who choose the church for their profession but that of a repugnance on their part to associate with persons of grave character and decorous manners <\s>
<s> is the distracted remnant of the party now surviving improved in that respect <\s>
<s> the dazzling talents with which it was once distinguished have passed away pleasure and dissipation are no longer in that quarter exhibited to the world in such reconcilement with business as excited dispositions to forgive what could not be approved and a species of wonder not sufficiently kept apart from envy at the extraordinary gifts and powers by which the union was accomplished <\s>
<s> this injurious conjunction no longer exists so as to attract the eyes of the nation <\s>
<s> but we look in vain for signs that the opinions habits and feelings of the party are tending towards a restoration of that genuine english character by which alone the confidence of the sound part of the people can be recovered <\s>
<s> the public life of the candidate who now for the first time solicits your suffrages my brother freeholders cannot however without injustice to that party be deemed a fair exponent of its political opinions <\s>

<s> remember what england might have been with an administration countenancing french doctrines at the dawn of the french revolution and suffering them as it advanced to be sown with every wind that came across the channel <\s>
<s> think what was the state of europe before the french emperor the apparent and in too many respects the real idol of opposition was overthrown <\s>
<s> numbers i am aware do not cease vehemently to maintain that the late war was neither just nor necessary that the ostensible and real causes of it were widely different that it was not begun and persisted in for the purpose of withstanding foreign aggression and in defence of social order but from unprincipled ambition in the powers of europe eager to seize that opportunity of augmenting their territories at the expence of distracted and enfeebled france events ever to be lamented do i grant give too much colour to those affirmations <\s>
<s> but this was a war upon a large scale wherein many belligerents took part and no one who distinctly remembers the state of europe at its commencement will be inclined any more to question that the alleged motives had a solid foundation because then or afterwards others might mix with them than he would doubt that the maintenance of christianity and the reduction of the power of the infidels were the principal motives of the crusades because roving adventurers joining in those expeditions turned them to their own profit <\s>
<s> traders and hypocrites may make part of a caravan bound to mecca but it does not follow that a religious observance is not the prime object of the pilgrimage <\s>
<s> the political fanaticism it deserves no milder name that pervaded the manifesto issued by the duke of brunswick on his entry into france proves that he and the power whose organ he was were swayed on their march by an ambition very different from that of territorial aggrandizement at least if such ambition existed it is plain that feelings of another kind blinded them to the means of gratifying it <\s>
<s> nevertheless we must acknowledge the passion soon manifested itself and in a quarter where it was least excusable <\s>
<s> the seizure of valenciennes in the name of the emperor of germany was an act of such glaring rapacity and gave the lie so unfeelingly to all that had been professed that the then ministers of great britain doubtless opposed the intention with a strong remonstrance <\s>
<s> but the dictates of magnanimity which in such cases is but another word for high and sage policy would have been 'this unjust act must either be abandoned or great britain shall retire from a contest which if such principles are to govern or interfere with the conduct of it cannot but be calamitous <\s>
<s> a threat to this purpose was either not given or not acted upon <\s>
<s> from that moment the alliance of the french loyalists with the coalesced powers seemed to have no ground of rational patriotism to stand upon <\s>
<s> their professed helpers became their worst enemies and numbers among them not only began to wish for the defeat of their false friends but joined themselves to their fellow countrymen of all parties who were labouring to effect it but the military successes of the french arising mainly from this want of principle in the confederate powers in course of time placed the policy and justice of the war upon a new footing <\s>
<s> however men might differ about the necessity or reasonableness of resorting to arms in the first instance things were brought to such a state that among the disinterested and dispassionate there could be but one opinion even if nothing higher than security was aimed at on the demand for the utmost strength of the nation being put forth in the prosecution of the war till it should assume a more hopeful aspect and now it was that ministers made ample amends for past subserviency to selfish coadjutors and proved themselves worthy of being entrusted with the fate of europe <\s>
<s> while the opposition were taking counsel from their fears and recommending despair while they continued to magnify without scruple the strength of the enemy and to expose misrepresent and therefore increase the weaknesses of their country his majesty's ministers were not daunted though often discouraged they struggled up against adversity with fortitude and persevered heroically throwing themselves upon the honour and wisdom of the country and trusting for the issue to the decrees of a just providence and for this determination everlasting gratitude will attend them <\s>
<s> from the internal situation of france produced by the revolution war with the contiguous powers was inevitable sooner or later the evil must have been encountered and it was of little importance whether england took a share in it somewhat earlier than by fallible judgments might be deemed necessary or not <\s>
<s> the frankness with which the faults that were committed have been acknowledged entitles the writer to some regard when speaking from an intimate knowledge of the internal state of france at that time he affirms that the war waged against her was in a liberal interpretation of the words just and necessary <\s>
<s> at all events our nation viewed it in this light <\s>
<s> a large majority of the inhabitants of great britain called for the war and they who will the end will the means the war being deemed necessary taxes became indispensible for its support <\s>
<s> some might prefer one mode of raising them some another but these are minor considerations <\s>
<s> public men united in bodies must act on great principles <\s>
<s> mutual deference is a fundamental requisite for the composition and efficiency of a party for if individual judgment is to be obtruded and insisted upon in subordinate concerns the march of business will be perpetually obstructed <\s>
<s> the leaders will not know whom they can depend upon and therefore will be at a loss what to recommend and how to act <\s>
<s> if a public man differs from his party in essentials conscience and honour demand that he should withdraw but if there be no such difference it is incumbent upon him to submit his personal opinion to the general sense <\s>
<s> he therefore who thought the prosecution of the war necessary could not condemn the public imposts on this consequence the steady adherents of ministers rest their claim to approbation and advance it boldly in defiance of the outcry raised against the government on account of the burthens which the situation of europe compelled it to lay upon the people <\s>
<s> in matters of taste it is a process attended with little advantage and often injurious to compare one set of artists or writers with another <\s>
<s> but in estimating the merits of public men especially of two parties acting in direct opposition it is not only expedient but indispensible that both should be kept constantly in sight <\s>
<s> the truth or fallacy of french principles and the tendency good or bad of the revolution which sprang out of them and the necessity or non necessity the policy or impolicy of resisting by war the encroachments of republican and imperial france these were the opposite grounds upon which each party staked their credit here we behold them in full contrast with each other to whom shall the crown be given <\s>
<s> on whom has the light fallen <\s>
<s> and who are covered by shade and thick darkness <\s>
<s> the magnanimity which resolved that for principle's sake no efforts should be spared to crush a bestial despotism was acknowledged by every manly spirit whom party degenerating into faction had not vitiated <\s>
<s> that such was the dictate of confiding wisdom had long been inwardly felt and the prudence of the course was evinced by the triumphant issue but to the very completeness of this triumph may be indirectly attributed no small portion of the obloquy how heaped upon those advisers through whom it was achieved <\s>
<s> the power of napoleon buonaparte was overthrown his person has disappeared from the theatre of europe his name has almost deserted the columns of her daily and weekly journals but as he has left no successor as there is no foreign tyrant of sufficient importance to attract hatred by exciting fear many honest english patriots must either find or set up something at home for the employment of those affections <\s>
<s> this is too natural to occasion surprise thousands are so framed that they are but languidly conscious of their love of an object unless while they feel themselves in an active state of aversion to something which they can regard as its opposite thus we see men who had been proud of their attachment to his majesty's ministers during the awful struggle as soon as it was over allowing on the first temptation that proud attachment to be converted into immoderate suspicion and a long experienced gratitude into sudden alienation through this infirmity many were betrayed into taking part with the men whom they had heretofore despised or condemned and assisted them in reviling their own government for suffering among the states of the continent institutions to remain which the respective nations surely the best if not the only judges in the case were unwilling to part with and for having permitted things to be done either just and proper in themselves or if indeed abuses abuses of that kind which great britain had neither right to oppose nor power to prevent <\s>
<s> not a frenchman is in arms in spain <\s>
<s> but alas for the credit of the english cabinet ferdinand though a lawful appears to be a sorry king and the inquisition though venerated by the people of spain as a holy tribunal which has spread a protecting shade over their religion for hundreds of years is among protestants an abomination <\s>
<s> is that however a reason why we should not rejoice that spain is restored to the rank of an independent nation and that her resources do not continue at the disposal of a foreign tyrant for the annoyance of great britain <\s>
<s> prussia no longer receives decrees from the tuilleries but nothing we are told is gained by this deliverance because the sovereign of that country has not participated as far as became him a popular effervescence and has withheld from his subjects certain privileges which they have proved themselves to all but heated judgments not yet qualified to receive <\s>
<s> now if numbers can blame without cause the british cabinet for events falling below their wishes in cases remote from their immediate concerns the reasonableness of their opinions may well be questioned in points where selfish passion is touched to the quick yes in spite of the outcry of such men to the contrary every enlightened politician and discerning patriot however diffident as to what was the exact line of prudence in such arduous circumstances will reprobate the conduct of those who were for reducing public expenditure with a precipitation that might have produced a convulsion in the state <\s>
<s> the habeas corpus act is also our own near concern it was suspended some think without sufficient cause not so however the persons who had the best means of ascertaining the state of the country for they could have been induced to have recourse to a measure at all times so obnoxious by nothing less than a persuasion of its expediency <\s>
<s> but persuasion an objector will say is produced in many ways and even that degree of it which in these matters passes for conviction depends less upon external testimony than on the habits and feelings of those by whom the testimony is to be weighed and decided upon <\s>
<s> a council for the administration of affairs is far from being as favourably circumstanced as a tribunal of law for the party which is to pronounce upon the case has had to procure the evidence the sum and quality of which must needs have been affected by previously existing prejudices and by any bias received in the process of collecting it the privileges of the subject one might think would never be unjustifiably infringed if it were only from considerations of self interest but power is apt to resort to unnecessary rigour in order to supply the deficiencies of authority forfeited by remissness it is also not unfrequently exerted merely to shew that it is possessed to shew this to others while power is a novelty and when it has long ceased to be so to prove it to ourselves <\s>

<s> brougham and his coadjutors <\s>
<s> but to the judicious freeholders of westmoreland whether gentry or yeomanry rich or poor he will in vain adduce this or any other part of the recent conduct of opposition as a motive for strengthening their interests amongst us <\s>
<s> no freeholders we must wait assuring them that they shall have a reasonable portion of our support as soon as they have proved that they deserve it <\s>
<s> till that time comes it will not grieve us that this county should supply two representatives to uphold the servants of the crown even if both should continue through unavoidable circumstances to issue from one family amongst us <\s>
<s> till that change takes place we will treat with scorn the senseless outcry for the recovery of an independence which has never been lost <\s>
<s> we are have been and will remain independent and the host of men respectable on every account who have publicly avowed their desire to maintain our present representatives in their seats deem it insolence to assert the contrary <\s>
<s> they are independent in every rational sense of the word acknowledging however that they rest upon a principle and are incorporated with an interest and this they regard as a proof that their affections are sane and their understandings superior to illusion <\s>
<s> but in certain vocabularies liberty is synonymous with licence and to be free as explained by some is to live and act without restraint <\s>
<s> in like manner independence according to the meaning of their interpretation is the explosive energy of conceit making blind havoc with expediency <\s>
<s> it is a presumptuous spirit at war with all the passive worth of mankind <\s>
<s> the independence which they boast of despises habit and time honoured forms of subordination it consists in breaking old ties upon new temptations in casting off the modest garb of private obligation to strut about in the glittering armour of public virtue in sacrificing with jacobinical infatuation the near to the remote and preferring to what has been known and tried that which has no distinct existence even in imagination in renouncing with voluble tongue and vain heart every thing intricate in motive and mixed in quality in a downright passion of love for absolute unapproachable patriotism <\s>
<s> in short the independence these reformers bawl for is the worthy precursor of the liberty they adore making her first essay by starting out of the course for the pleasure of falling into the ditch and asserting her heaven born vigour by soaring above the level of humanity in profession that it may more conspicuously appear how far she can fall below it in practice <\s>
<s> to this spurious independence the friends of our present representatives lay no claim <\s>
<s> they assert in the face of the world that those representatives hold their seats by free election that has placed them there and why should we wish to change what we do not disapprove of that which could not have been without our approbation <\s>

<s> gentlemen much of my former address originated in deference to that sense of right which is inseparable from the minds of enlightened patriots <\s>
<s> passing from local considerations i wrote under a belief that whatever personal or family leanings might prevail among you you would be moved by a wish to see the supporters of his majesty's ministers and their opponents possessed relatively to each other of that degree of strength which might render both parties in their several capacities most serviceable to the state <\s>
<s> i noticed that this just proportion of strength no longer remained and shewed that the opposition had caused it to be destroyed by holding from the beginning of the french revolution such a course as introduced in parliament discord among themselves deprived them in that house and elsewhere of the respect which from their adversaries they had been accustomed to command turned indifferent persons into enemies and alienated throughout the island the affections of thousands who had been proud to unite with them <\s>
<s> this weakness and degradation deplored by all true friends of the commonweal was sufficiently accounted for without even adverting to the fact that when the disasters of the war had induced the country to forgive and in some degree to forget the alarming attachment of that party to french theories and power heightened by the popularity of hope and expectation was thrown into their hands they disgusted even bigotted adherents by the rapacious use they made of that power stooping to so many offensive compromises and committing so many faults in every department that a government of talents if such be the fruits of talent was proved to be the most mischievous sort of government which england had ever been troubled with <\s>
<s> so that whether in or out of place an evil genius seemed to attend them <\s>
<s> how could all this happen <\s>
<s> for the fundamental reason that neither the religion the laws the morals the manners nor the literature of the country especially as contrasted with those of france were prized by the leaders of the party as they deserved <\s>
<s> it is a notorious fact that among their personal friends was scarcely to be found a single clergyman of distinction so that how to dispose of their ecclesiastical patronage in a manner that might do them credit they were almost as ignorant as strangers landed for the first time in a foreign country <\s>
<s> this is not to be accounted for on any supposition since the education of men of rank naturally devolves on those members of our universities who choose the church for their profession but that of a repugnance on their part to associate with persons of grave character and decorous manners <\s>
<s> is the distracted remnant of the party now surviving improved in that respect <\s>
<s> the dazzling talents with which it was once distinguished have passed away pleasure and dissipation are no longer in that quarter exhibited to the world in such reconcilement with business as excited dispositions to forgive what could not be approved and a species of wonder not sufficiently kept apart from envy at the extraordinary gifts and powers by which the union was accomplished <\s>
<s> this injurious conjunction no longer exists so as to attract the eyes of the nation <\s>
<s> but we look in vain for signs that the opinions habits and feelings of the party are tending towards a restoration of that genuine english character by which alone the confidence of the sound part of the people can be recovered <\s>
<s> the public life of the candidate who now for the first time solicits your suffrages my brother freeholders cannot however without injustice to that party be deemed a fair exponent of its political opinions <\s>
<s> it has indeed been too tolerant with mr <\s>
<s> brougham while he was labouring to ingraft certain sour cuttings from the wild wood of ultra reform on the reverend though somewhat decayed stock of that tree of whiggism which flourished proudly under the cultivation of our ancestors <\s>
<s> this indulgence and others like it will embolden him to aim at passing himself off as the delegate of opposition and the authorized pleader of their cause <\s>
<s> but time that judge from whom none but triflers appeal to conjecture has decided upon leading principles and main events and given the verdict against his clients <\s>
<s> while with a ready tongue the advocate of a disappointed party is filling one scale do you with a clear memory and apt judgment silently throw in what of right belongs to the other and the result will be that no sensible man among you who has supported the present members on account of their steady adherence to ministers can be induced to change his conduct or be persuaded that the hour is either come or approaching when for the sake of bringing the power of opposition in this county nearer to an equality with that of ministers it will be his duty to vote against those representatives in whom he has hitherto confided <\s>
<s> brougham had not individually passed far beyond the line of that party if his conduct had been such that even they themselves would admit that he truly belonged to them the exception would still lie against the general rule and will remain till the character of men and measures materially changes for the better assuredly on the one side if not for the worse on the other <\s>

<s> however men might differ about the necessity or reasonableness of resorting to arms in the first instance things were brought to such a state that among the disinterested and dispassionate there could be but one opinion even if nothing higher than security was aimed at on the demand for the utmost strength of the nation being put forth in the prosecution of the war till it should assume a more hopeful aspect and now it was that ministers made ample amends for past subserviency to selfish coadjutors and proved themselves worthy of being entrusted with the fate of europe <\s>
<s> while the opposition were taking counsel from their fears and recommending despair while they continued to magnify without scruple the strength of the enemy and to expose misrepresent and therefore increase the weaknesses of their country his majesty's ministers were not daunted though often discouraged they struggled up against adversity with fortitude and persevered heroically throwing themselves upon the honour and wisdom of the country and trusting for the issue to the decrees of a just providence and for this determination everlasting gratitude will attend them <\s>

<s> in matters of taste it is a process attended with little advantage and often injurious to compare one set of artists or writers with another <\s>

<s> the truth or fallacy of french principles and the tendency good or bad of the revolution which sprang out of them and the necessity or non necessity the policy or impolicy of resisting by war the encroachments of republican and imperial france these were the opposite grounds upon which each party staked their credit here we behold them in full contrast with each other to whom shall the crown be given <\s>

<s> this is too natural to occasion surprise thousands are so framed that they are but languidly conscious of their love of an object unless while they feel themselves in an active state of aversion to something which they can regard as its opposite thus we see men who had been proud of their attachment to his majesty's ministers during the awful struggle as soon as it was over allowing on the first temptation that proud attachment to be converted into immoderate suspicion and a long experienced gratitude into sudden alienation through this infirmity many were betrayed into taking part with the men whom they had heretofore despised or condemned and assisted them in reviling their own government for suffering among the states of the continent institutions to remain which the respective nations surely the best if not the only judges in the case were unwilling to part with and for having permitted things to be done either just and proper in themselves or if indeed abuses abuses of that kind which great britain had neither right to oppose nor power to prevent <\s>

<s> now if numbers can blame without cause the british cabinet for events falling below their wishes in cases remote from their immediate concerns the reasonableness of their opinions may well be questioned in points where selfish passion is touched to the quick yes in spite of the outcry of such men to the contrary every enlightened politician and discerning patriot however diffident as to what was the exact line of prudence in such arduous circumstances will reprobate the conduct of those who were for reducing public expenditure with a precipitation that might have produced a convulsion in the state <\s>
<s> the habeas corpus act is also our own near concern it was suspended some think without sufficient cause not so however the persons who had the best means of ascertaining the state of the country for they could have been induced to have recourse to a measure at all times so obnoxious by nothing less than a persuasion of its expediency <\s>

<s> happily for the inhabitants of westmoreland as no dispositions existing among them could furnish a motive for this restrictive measure so they will not be sorry that their remoteness from scenes of public confusion has placed them where they will be slow to give an unqualified opinion upon its merits <\s>
<s> yet it will not escape their discernment that if doubts might have been entertained whether the ignorant and distressed multitude in other parts of the island were actually brought to a state that justified the suspension of this law such doubts must have been weakened if not wholly removed by the subsequent behaviour of those in the upper ranks of society who in order to arraign the government and denounce the laws have seized every opportunity of palliating sedition if not of exculpating treason <\s>

<s> till that time comes it will not grieve us that this county should supply two representatives to uphold the servants of the crown even if both should continue through unavoidable circumstances to issue from one family amongst us <\s>
<s> till that change takes place we will treat with scorn the senseless outcry for the recovery of an independence which has never been lost <\s>
<s> we are have been and will remain independent and the host of men respectable on every account who have publicly avowed their desire to maintain our present representatives in their seats deem it insolence to assert the contrary <\s>
<s> they are independent in every rational sense of the word acknowledging however that they rest upon a principle and are incorporated with an interest and this they regard as a proof that their affections are sane and their understandings superior to illusion <\s>
<s> but in certain vocabularies liberty is synonymous with licence and to be free as explained by some is to live and act without restraint <\s>
<s> in like manner independence according to the meaning of their interpretation is the explosive energy of conceit making blind havoc with expediency <\s>
<s> it is a presumptuous spirit at war with all the passive worth of mankind <\s>
<s> the independence which they boast of despises habit and time honoured forms of subordination it consists in breaking old ties upon new temptations in casting off the modest garb of private obligation to strut about in the glittering armour of public virtue in sacrificing with jacobinical infatuation the near to the remote and preferring to what has been known and tried that which has no distinct existence even in imagination in renouncing with voluble tongue and vain heart every thing intricate in motive and mixed in quality in a downright passion of love for absolute unapproachable patriotism <\s>
<s> in short the independence these reformers bawl for is the worthy precursor of the liberty they adore making her first essay by starting out of the course for the pleasure of falling into the ditch and asserting her heaven born vigour by soaring above the level of humanity in profession that it may more conspicuously appear how far she can fall below it in practice <\s>
<s> to this spurious independence the friends of our present representatives lay no claim <\s>
<s> they assert in the face of the world that those representatives hold their seats by free election that has placed them there and why should we wish to change what we do not disapprove of that which could not have been without our approbation <\s>

<s> let those who think that they are degraded proclaim their own dishonour <\s>
<s> gentlemen much of my former address originated in deference to that sense of right which is inseparable from the minds of enlightened patriots <\s>
<s> passing from local considerations i wrote under a belief that whatever personal or family leanings might prevail among you you would be moved by a wish to see the supporters of his majesty's ministers and their opponents possessed relatively to each other of that degree of strength which might render both parties in their several capacities most serviceable to the state <\s>
<s> i noticed that this just proportion of strength no longer remained and shewed that the opposition had caused it to be destroyed by holding from the beginning of the french revolution such a course as introduced in parliament discord among themselves deprived them in that house and elsewhere of the respect which from their adversaries they had been accustomed to command turned indifferent persons into enemies and alienated throughout the island the affections of thousands who had been proud to unite with them <\s>
<s> this weakness and degradation deplored by all true friends of the commonweal was sufficiently accounted for without even adverting to the fact that when the disasters of the war had induced the country to forgive and in some degree to forget the alarming attachment of that party to french theories and power heightened by the popularity of hope and expectation was thrown into their hands they disgusted even bigotted adherents by the rapacious use they made of that power stooping to so many offensive compromises and committing so many faults in every department that a government of talents if such be the fruits of talent was proved to be the most mischievous sort of government which england had ever been troubled with <\s>
<s> so that whether in or out of place an evil genius seemed to attend them <\s>
<s> how could all this happen <\s>
<s> for the fundamental reason that neither the religion the laws the morals the manners nor the literature of the country especially as contrasted with those of france were prized by the leaders of the party as they deserved <\s>
<s> it is a notorious fact that among their personal friends was scarcely to be found a single clergyman of distinction so that how to dispose of their ecclesiastical patronage in a manner that might do them credit they were almost as ignorant as strangers landed for the first time in a foreign country <\s>
<s> this is not to be accounted for on any supposition since the education of men of rank naturally devolves on those members of our universities who choose the church for their profession but that of a repugnance on their part to associate with persons of grave character and decorous manners <\s>
<s> is the distracted remnant of the party now surviving improved in that respect <\s>
<s> the dazzling talents with which it was once distinguished have passed away pleasure and dissipation are no longer in that quarter exhibited to the world in such reconcilement with business as excited dispositions to forgive what could not be approved and a species of wonder not sufficiently kept apart from envy at the extraordinary gifts and powers by which the union was accomplished <\s>
<s> this injurious conjunction no longer exists so as to attract the eyes of the nation <\s>
<s> but we look in vain for signs that the opinions habits and feelings of the party are tending towards a restoration of that genuine english character by which alone the confidence of the sound part of the people can be recovered <\s>
<s> the public life of the candidate who now for the first time solicits your suffrages my brother freeholders cannot however without injustice to that party be deemed a fair exponent of its political opinions <\s>
<s> it has indeed been too tolerant with mr <\s>
<s> brougham while he was labouring to ingraft certain sour cuttings from the wild wood of ultra reform on the reverend though somewhat decayed stock of that tree of whiggism which flourished proudly under the cultivation of our ancestors <\s>
<s> this indulgence and others like it will embolden him to aim at passing himself off as the delegate of opposition and the authorized pleader of their cause <\s>
<s> but time that judge from whom none but triflers appeal to conjecture has decided upon leading principles and main events and given the verdict against his clients <\s>
<s> while with a ready tongue the advocate of a disappointed party is filling one scale do you with a clear memory and apt judgment silently throw in what of right belongs to the other and the result will be that no sensible man among you who has supported the present members on account of their steady adherence to ministers can be induced to change his conduct or be persuaded that the hour is either come or approaching when for the sake of bringing the power of opposition in this county nearer to an equality with that of ministers it will be his duty to vote against those representatives in whom he has hitherto confided <\s>
<s> brougham had not individually passed far beyond the line of that party if his conduct had been such that even they themselves would admit that he truly belonged to them the exception would still lie against the general rule and will remain till the character of men and measures materially changes for the better assuredly on the one side if not for the worse on the other <\s>
<s> remember what england might have been with an administration countenancing french doctrines at the dawn of the french revolution and suffering them as it advanced to be sown with every wind that came across the channel <\s>
<s> think what was the state of europe before the french emperor the apparent and in too many respects the real idol of opposition was overthrown <\s>
<s> numbers i am aware do not cease vehemently to maintain that the late war was neither just nor necessary that the ostensible and real causes of it were widely different that it was not begun and persisted in for the purpose of withstanding foreign aggression and in defence of social order but from unprincipled ambition in the powers of europe eager to seize that opportunity of augmenting their territories at the expence of distracted and enfeebled france events ever to be lamented do i grant give too much colour to those affirmations <\s>
<s> but this was a war upon a large scale wherein many belligerents took part and no one who distinctly remembers the state of europe at its commencement will be inclined any more to question that the alleged motives had a solid foundation because then or afterwards others might mix with them than he would doubt that the maintenance of christianity and the reduction of the power of the infidels were the principal motives of the crusades because roving adventurers joining in those expeditions turned them to their own profit <\s>
<s> traders and hypocrites may make part of a caravan bound to mecca but it does not follow that a religious observance is not the prime object of the pilgrimage <\s>
<s> the political fanaticism it deserves no milder name that pervaded the manifesto issued by the duke of brunswick on his entry into france proves that he and the power whose organ he was were swayed on their march by an ambition very different from that of territorial aggrandizement at least if such ambition existed it is plain that feelings of another kind blinded them to the means of gratifying it <\s>

<s> let those who think that they are degraded proclaim their own dishonour <\s>
<s> gentlemen much of my former address originated in deference to that sense of right which is inseparable from the minds of enlightened patriots <\s>
<s> passing from local considerations i wrote under a belief that whatever personal or family leanings might prevail among you you would be moved by a wish to see the supporters of his majesty's ministers and their opponents possessed relatively to each other of that degree of strength which might render both parties in their several capacities most serviceable to the state <\s>
<s> i noticed that this just proportion of strength no longer remained and shewed that the opposition had caused it to be destroyed by holding from the beginning of the french revolution such a course as introduced in parliament discord among themselves deprived them in that house and elsewhere of the respect which from their adversaries they had been accustomed to command turned indifferent persons into enemies and alienated throughout the island the affections of thousands who had been proud to unite with them <\s>
<s> this weakness and degradation deplored by all true friends of the commonweal was sufficiently accounted for without even adverting to the fact that when the disasters of the war had induced the country to forgive and in some degree to forget the alarming attachment of that party to french theories and power heightened by the popularity of hope and expectation was thrown into their hands they disgusted even bigotted adherents by the rapacious use they made of that power stooping to so many offensive compromises and committing so many faults in every department that a government of talents if such be the fruits of talent was proved to be the most mischievous sort of government which england had ever been troubled with <\s>
<s> so that whether in or out of place an evil genius seemed to attend them <\s>
<s> how could all this happen <\s>
<s> for the fundamental reason that neither the religion the laws the morals the manners nor the literature of the country especially as contrasted with those of france were prized by the leaders of the party as they deserved <\s>
<s> it is a notorious fact that among their personal friends was scarcely to be found a single clergyman of distinction so that how to dispose of their ecclesiastical patronage in a manner that might do them credit they were almost as ignorant as strangers landed for the first time in a foreign country <\s>
<s> this is not to be accounted for on any supposition since the education of men of rank naturally devolves on those members of our universities who choose the church for their profession but that of a repugnance on their part to associate with persons of grave character and decorous manners <\s>
<s> is the distracted remnant of the party now surviving improved in that respect <\s>
<s> the dazzling talents with which it was once distinguished have passed away pleasure and dissipation are no longer in that quarter exhibited to the world in such reconcilement with business as excited dispositions to forgive what could not be approved and a species of wonder not sufficiently kept apart from envy at the extraordinary gifts and powers by which the union was accomplished <\s>
<s> this injurious conjunction no longer exists so as to attract the eyes of the nation <\s>
<s> but we look in vain for signs that the opinions habits and feelings of the party are tending towards a restoration of that genuine english character by which alone the confidence of the sound part of the people can be recovered <\s>
<s> the public life of the candidate who now for the first time solicits your suffrages my brother freeholders cannot however without injustice to that party be deemed a fair exponent of its political opinions <\s>
<s> it has indeed been too tolerant with mr <\s>
<s> brougham while he was labouring to ingraft certain sour cuttings from the wild wood of ultra reform on the reverend though somewhat decayed stock of that tree of whiggism which flourished proudly under the cultivation of our ancestors <\s>
<s> this indulgence and others like it will embolden him to aim at passing himself off as the delegate of opposition and the authorized pleader of their cause <\s>
<s> but time that judge from whom none but triflers appeal to conjecture has decided upon leading principles and main events and given the verdict against his clients <\s>
<s> while with a ready tongue the advocate of a disappointed party is filling one scale do you with a clear memory and apt judgment silently throw in what of right belongs to the other and the result will be that no sensible man among you who has supported the present members on account of their steady adherence to ministers can be induced to change his conduct or be persuaded that the hour is either come or approaching when for the sake of bringing the power of opposition in this county nearer to an equality with that of ministers it will be his duty to vote against those representatives in whom he has hitherto confided <\s>
<s> brougham had not individually passed far beyond the line of that party if his conduct had been such that even they themselves would admit that he truly belonged to them the exception would still lie against the general rule and will remain till the character of men and measures materially changes for the better assuredly on the one side if not for the worse on the other <\s>
<s> remember what england might have been with an administration countenancing french doctrines at the dawn of the french revolution and suffering them as it advanced to be sown with every wind that came across the channel <\s>
<s> think what was the state of europe before the french emperor the apparent and in too many respects the real idol of opposition was overthrown <\s>
<s> numbers i am aware do not cease vehemently to maintain that the late war was neither just nor necessary that the ostensible and real causes of it were widely different that it was not begun and persisted in for the purpose of withstanding foreign aggression and in defence of social order but from unprincipled ambition in the powers of europe eager to seize that opportunity of augmenting their territories at the expence of distracted and enfeebled france events ever to be lamented do i grant give too much colour to those affirmations <\s>
<s> but this was a war upon a large scale wherein many belligerents took part and no one who distinctly remembers the state of europe at its commencement will be inclined any more to question that the alleged motives had a solid foundation because then or afterwards others might mix with them than he would doubt that the maintenance of christianity and the reduction of the power of the infidels were the principal motives of the crusades because roving adventurers joining in those expeditions turned them to their own profit <\s>
<s> traders and hypocrites may make part of a caravan bound to mecca but it does not follow that a religious observance is not the prime object of the pilgrimage <\s>
<s> the political fanaticism it deserves no milder name that pervaded the manifesto issued by the duke of brunswick on his entry into france proves that he and the power whose organ he was were swayed on their march by an ambition very different from that of territorial aggrandizement at least if such ambition existed it is plain that feelings of another kind blinded them to the means of gratifying it <\s>
<s> nevertheless we must acknowledge the passion soon manifested itself and in a quarter where it was least excusable <\s>
<s> the seizure of valenciennes in the name of the emperor of germany was an act of such glaring rapacity and gave the lie so unfeelingly to all that had been professed that the then ministers of great britain doubtless opposed the intention with a strong remonstrance <\s>
<s> but the dictates of magnanimity which in such cases is but another word for high and sage policy would have been 'this unjust act must either be abandoned or great britain shall retire from a contest which if such principles are to govern or interfere with the conduct of it cannot but be calamitous <\s>
<s> a threat to this purpose was either not given or not acted upon <\s>
<s> from that moment the alliance of the french loyalists with the coalesced powers seemed to have no ground of rational patriotism to stand upon <\s>
<s> their professed helpers became their worst enemies and numbers among them not only began to wish for the defeat of their false friends but joined themselves to their fellow countrymen of all parties who were labouring to effect it but the military successes of the french arising mainly from this want of principle in the confederate powers in course of time placed the policy and justice of the war upon a new footing <\s>
<s> however men might differ about the necessity or reasonableness of resorting to arms in the first instance things were brought to such a state that among the disinterested and dispassionate there could be but one opinion even if nothing higher than security was aimed at on the demand for the utmost strength of the nation being put forth in the prosecution of the war till it should assume a more hopeful aspect and now it was that ministers made ample amends for past subserviency to selfish coadjutors and proved themselves worthy of being entrusted with the fate of europe <\s>
<s> while the opposition were taking counsel from their fears and recommending despair while they continued to magnify without scruple the strength of the enemy and to expose misrepresent and therefore increase the weaknesses of their country his majesty's ministers were not daunted though often discouraged they struggled up against adversity with fortitude and persevered heroically throwing themselves upon the honour and wisdom of the country and trusting for the issue to the decrees of a just providence and for this determination everlasting gratitude will attend them <\s>

<s> passing from local considerations i wrote under a belief that whatever personal or family leanings might prevail among you you would be moved by a wish to see the supporters of his majesty's ministers and their opponents possessed relatively to each other of that degree of strength which might render both parties in their several capacities most serviceable to the state <\s>
<s> i noticed that this just proportion of strength no longer remained and shewed that the opposition had caused it to be destroyed by holding from the beginning of the french revolution such a course as introduced in parliament discord among themselves deprived them in that house and elsewhere of the respect which from their adversaries they had been accustomed to command turned indifferent persons into enemies and alienated throughout the island the affections of thousands who had been proud to unite with them <\s>
<s> this weakness and degradation deplored by all true friends of the commonweal was sufficiently accounted for without even adverting to the fact that when the disasters of the war had induced the country to forgive and in some degree to forget the alarming attachment of that party to french theories and power heightened by the popularity of hope and expectation was thrown into their hands they disgusted even bigotted adherents by the rapacious use they made of that power stooping to so many offensive compromises and committing so many faults in every department that a government of talents if such be the fruits of talent was proved to be the most mischievous sort of government which england had ever been troubled with <\s>
<s> so that whether in or out of place an evil genius seemed to attend them <\s>
<s> how could all this happen <\s>
<s> for the fundamental reason that neither the religion the laws the morals the manners nor the literature of the country especially as contrasted with those of france were prized by the leaders of the party as they deserved <\s>
<s> it is a notorious fact that among their personal friends was scarcely to be found a single clergyman of distinction so that how to dispose of their ecclesiastical patronage in a manner that might do them credit they were almost as ignorant as strangers landed for the first time in a foreign country <\s>
<s> this is not to be accounted for on any supposition since the education of men of rank naturally devolves on those members of our universities who choose the church for their profession but that of a repugnance on their part to associate with persons of grave character and decorous manners <\s>
<s> is the distracted remnant of the party now surviving improved in that respect <\s>
<s> the dazzling talents with which it was once distinguished have passed away pleasure and dissipation are no longer in that quarter exhibited to the world in such reconcilement with business as excited dispositions to forgive what could not be approved and a species of wonder not sufficiently kept apart from envy at the extraordinary gifts and powers by which the union was accomplished <\s>
<s> this injurious conjunction no longer exists so as to attract the eyes of the nation <\s>
<s> but we look in vain for signs that the opinions habits and feelings of the party are tending towards a restoration of that genuine english character by which alone the confidence of the sound part of the people can be recovered <\s>
<s> the public life of the candidate who now for the first time solicits your suffrages my brother freeholders cannot however without injustice to that party be deemed a fair exponent of its political opinions <\s>
<s> it has indeed been too tolerant with mr <\s>
<s> brougham while he was labouring to ingraft certain sour cuttings from the wild wood of ultra reform on the reverend though somewhat decayed stock of that tree of whiggism which flourished proudly under the cultivation of our ancestors <\s>
<s> this indulgence and others like it will embolden him to aim at passing himself off as the delegate of opposition and the authorized pleader of their cause <\s>
<s> but time that judge from whom none but triflers appeal to conjecture has decided upon leading principles and main events and given the verdict against his clients <\s>
<s> while with a ready tongue the advocate of a disappointed party is filling one scale do you with a clear memory and apt judgment silently throw in what of right belongs to the other and the result will be that no sensible man among you who has supported the present members on account of their steady adherence to ministers can be induced to change his conduct or be persuaded that the hour is either come or approaching when for the sake of bringing the power of opposition in this county nearer to an equality with that of ministers it will be his duty to vote against those representatives in whom he has hitherto confided <\s>
<s> brougham had not individually passed far beyond the line of that party if his conduct had been such that even they themselves would admit that he truly belonged to them the exception would still lie against the general rule and will remain till the character of men and measures materially changes for the better assuredly on the one side if not for the worse on the other <\s>
<s> remember what england might have been with an administration countenancing french doctrines at the dawn of the french revolution and suffering them as it advanced to be sown with every wind that came across the channel <\s>
<s> think what was the state of europe before the french emperor the apparent and in too many respects the real idol of opposition was overthrown <\s>
<s> numbers i am aware do not cease vehemently to maintain that the late war was neither just nor necessary that the ostensible and real causes of it were widely different that it was not begun and persisted in for the purpose of withstanding foreign aggression and in defence of social order but from unprincipled ambition in the powers of europe eager to seize that opportunity of augmenting their territories at the expence of distracted and enfeebled france events ever to be lamented do i grant give too much colour to those affirmations <\s>
<s> but this was a war upon a large scale wherein many belligerents took part and no one who distinctly remembers the state of europe at its commencement will be inclined any more to question that the alleged motives had a solid foundation because then or afterwards others might mix with them than he would doubt that the maintenance of christianity and the reduction of the power of the infidels were the principal motives of the crusades because roving adventurers joining in those expeditions turned them to their own profit <\s>
<s> traders and hypocrites may make part of a caravan bound to mecca but it does not follow that a religious observance is not the prime object of the pilgrimage <\s>
<s> the political fanaticism it deserves no milder name that pervaded the manifesto issued by the duke of brunswick on his entry into france proves that he and the power whose organ he was were swayed on their march by an ambition very different from that of territorial aggrandizement at least if such ambition existed it is plain that feelings of another kind blinded them to the means of gratifying it <\s>
<s> nevertheless we must acknowledge the passion soon manifested itself and in a quarter where it was least excusable <\s>
<s> the seizure of valenciennes in the name of the emperor of germany was an act of such glaring rapacity and gave the lie so unfeelingly to all that had been professed that the then ministers of great britain doubtless opposed the intention with a strong remonstrance <\s>
<s> but the dictates of magnanimity which in such cases is but another word for high and sage policy would have been 'this unjust act must either be abandoned or great britain shall retire from a contest which if such principles are to govern or interfere with the conduct of it cannot but be calamitous <\s>
<s> a threat to this purpose was either not given or not acted upon <\s>
<s> from that moment the alliance of the french loyalists with the coalesced powers seemed to have no ground of rational patriotism to stand upon <\s>
<s> their professed helpers became their worst enemies and numbers among them not only began to wish for the defeat of their false friends but joined themselves to their fellow countrymen of all parties who were labouring to effect it but the military successes of the french arising mainly from this want of principle in the confederate powers in course of time placed the policy and justice of the war upon a new footing <\s>
<s> however men might differ about the necessity or reasonableness of resorting to arms in the first instance things were brought to such a state that among the disinterested and dispassionate there could be but one opinion even if nothing higher than security was aimed at on the demand for the utmost strength of the nation being put forth in the prosecution of the war till it should assume a more hopeful aspect and now it was that ministers made ample amends for past subserviency to selfish coadjutors and proved themselves worthy of being entrusted with the fate of europe <\s>
<s> while the opposition were taking counsel from their fears and recommending despair while they continued to magnify without scruple the strength of the enemy and to expose misrepresent and therefore increase the weaknesses of their country his majesty's ministers were not daunted though often discouraged they struggled up against adversity with fortitude and persevered heroically throwing themselves upon the honour and wisdom of the country and trusting for the issue to the decrees of a just providence and for this determination everlasting gratitude will attend them <\s>
<s> from the internal situation of france produced by the revolution war with the contiguous powers was inevitable sooner or later the evil must have been encountered and it was of little importance whether england took a share in it somewhat earlier than by fallible judgments might be deemed necessary or not <\s>
<s> the frankness with which the faults that were committed have been acknowledged entitles the writer to some regard when speaking from an intimate knowledge of the internal state of france at that time he affirms that the war waged against her was in a liberal interpretation of the words just and necessary <\s>
<s> at all events our nation viewed it in this light <\s>
<s> a large majority of the inhabitants of great britain called for the war and they who will the end will the means the war being deemed necessary taxes became indispensible for its support <\s>
<s> some might prefer one mode of raising them some another but these are minor considerations <\s>
<s> public men united in bodies must act on great principles <\s>
<s> mutual deference is a fundamental requisite for the composition and efficiency of a party for if individual judgment is to be obtruded and insisted upon in subordinate concerns the march of business will be perpetually obstructed <\s>
<s> the leaders will not know whom they can depend upon and therefore will be at a loss what to recommend and how to act <\s>
<s> if a public man differs from his party in essentials conscience and honour demand that he should withdraw but if there be no such difference it is incumbent upon him to submit his personal opinion to the general sense <\s>
<s> he therefore who thought the prosecution of the war necessary could not condemn the public imposts on this consequence the steady adherents of ministers rest their claim to approbation and advance it boldly in defiance of the outcry raised against the government on account of the burthens which the situation of europe compelled it to lay upon the people <\s>
<s> in matters of taste it is a process attended with little advantage and often injurious to compare one set of artists or writers with another <\s>

<s> till that time comes it will not grieve us that this county should supply two representatives to uphold the servants of the crown even if both should continue through unavoidable circumstances to issue from one family amongst us <\s>
<s> till that change takes place we will treat with scorn the senseless outcry for the recovery of an independence which has never been lost <\s>
<s> we are have been and will remain independent and the host of men respectable on every account who have publicly avowed their desire to maintain our present representatives in their seats deem it insolence to assert the contrary <\s>
<s> they are independent in every rational sense of the word acknowledging however that they rest upon a principle and are incorporated with an interest and this they regard as a proof that their affections are sane and their understandings superior to illusion <\s>
<s> but in certain vocabularies liberty is synonymous with licence and to be free as explained by some is to live and act without restraint <\s>
<s> in like manner independence according to the meaning of their interpretation is the explosive energy of conceit making blind havoc with expediency <\s>
<s> it is a presumptuous spirit at war with all the passive worth of mankind <\s>
<s> the independence which they boast of despises habit and time honoured forms of subordination it consists in breaking old ties upon new temptations in casting off the modest garb of private obligation to strut about in the glittering armour of public virtue in sacrificing with jacobinical infatuation the near to the remote and preferring to what has been known and tried that which has no distinct existence even in imagination in renouncing with voluble tongue and vain heart every thing intricate in motive and mixed in quality in a downright passion of love for absolute unapproachable patriotism <\s>
<s> in short the independence these reformers bawl for is the worthy precursor of the liberty they adore making her first essay by starting out of the course for the pleasure of falling into the ditch and asserting her heaven born vigour by soaring above the level of humanity in profession that it may more conspicuously appear how far she can fall below it in practice <\s>
<s> to this spurious independence the friends of our present representatives lay no claim <\s>
<s> they assert in the face of the world that those representatives hold their seats by free election that has placed them there and why should we wish to change what we do not disapprove of that which could not have been without our approbation <\s>

<s> brougham had not individually passed far beyond the line of that party if his conduct had been such that even they themselves would admit that he truly belonged to them the exception would still lie against the general rule and will remain till the character of men and measures materially changes for the better assuredly on the one side if not for the worse on the other <\s>
<s> remember what england might have been with an administration countenancing french doctrines at the dawn of the french revolution and suffering them as it advanced to be sown with every wind that came across the channel <\s>
<s> think what was the state of europe before the french emperor the apparent and in too many respects the real idol of opposition was overthrown <\s>
<s> numbers i am aware do not cease vehemently to maintain that the late war was neither just nor necessary that the ostensible and real causes of it were widely different that it was not begun and persisted in for the purpose of withstanding foreign aggression and in defence of social order but from unprincipled ambition in the powers of europe eager to seize that opportunity of augmenting their territories at the expence of distracted and enfeebled france events ever to be lamented do i grant give too much colour to those affirmations <\s>
<s> but this was a war upon a large scale wherein many belligerents took part and no one who distinctly remembers the state of europe at its commencement will be inclined any more to question that the alleged motives had a solid foundation because then or afterwards others might mix with them than he would doubt that the maintenance of christianity and the reduction of the power of the infidels were the principal motives of the crusades because roving adventurers joining in those expeditions turned them to their own profit <\s>
<s> traders and hypocrites may make part of a caravan bound to mecca but it does not follow that a religious observance is not the prime object of the pilgrimage <\s>
<s> the political fanaticism it deserves no milder name that pervaded the manifesto issued by the duke of brunswick on his entry into france proves that he and the power whose organ he was were swayed on their march by an ambition very different from that of territorial aggrandizement at least if such ambition existed it is plain that feelings of another kind blinded them to the means of gratifying it <\s>
<s> nevertheless we must acknowledge the passion soon manifested itself and in a quarter where it was least excusable <\s>
<s> the seizure of valenciennes in the name of the emperor of germany was an act of such glaring rapacity and gave the lie so unfeelingly to all that had been professed that the then ministers of great britain doubtless opposed the intention with a strong remonstrance <\s>
<s> but the dictates of magnanimity which in such cases is but another word for high and sage policy would have been 'this unjust act must either be abandoned or great britain shall retire from a contest which if such principles are to govern or interfere with the conduct of it cannot but be calamitous <\s>
<s> a threat to this purpose was either not given or not acted upon <\s>
<s> from that moment the alliance of the french loyalists with the coalesced powers seemed to have no ground of rational patriotism to stand upon <\s>
<s> their professed helpers became their worst enemies and numbers among them not only began to wish for the defeat of their false friends but joined themselves to their fellow countrymen of all parties who were labouring to effect it but the military successes of the french arising mainly from this want of principle in the confederate powers in course of time placed the policy and justice of the war upon a new footing <\s>
<s> however men might differ about the necessity or reasonableness of resorting to arms in the first instance things were brought to such a state that among the disinterested and dispassionate there could be but one opinion even if nothing higher than security was aimed at on the demand for the utmost strength of the nation being put forth in the prosecution of the war till it should assume a more hopeful aspect and now it was that ministers made ample amends for past subserviency to selfish coadjutors and proved themselves worthy of being entrusted with the fate of europe <\s>
<s> while the opposition were taking counsel from their fears and recommending despair while they continued to magnify without scruple the strength of the enemy and to expose misrepresent and therefore increase the weaknesses of their country his majesty's ministers were not daunted though often discouraged they struggled up against adversity with fortitude and persevered heroically throwing themselves upon the honour and wisdom of the country and trusting for the issue to the decrees of a just providence and for this determination everlasting gratitude will attend them <\s>
<s> from the internal situation of france produced by the revolution war with the contiguous powers was inevitable sooner or later the evil must have been encountered and it was of little importance whether england took a share in it somewhat earlier than by fallible judgments might be deemed necessary or not <\s>
<s> the frankness with which the faults that were committed have been acknowledged entitles the writer to some regard when speaking from an intimate knowledge of the internal state of france at that time he affirms that the war waged against her was in a liberal interpretation of the words just and necessary <\s>
<s> at all events our nation viewed it in this light <\s>
<s> a large majority of the inhabitants of great britain called for the war and they who will the end will the means the war being deemed necessary taxes became indispensible for its support <\s>
<s> some might prefer one mode of raising them some another but these are minor considerations <\s>
<s> public men united in bodies must act on great principles <\s>
<s> mutual deference is a fundamental requisite for the composition and efficiency of a party for if individual judgment is to be obtruded and insisted upon in subordinate concerns the march of business will be perpetually obstructed <\s>
<s> the leaders will not know whom they can depend upon and therefore will be at a loss what to recommend and how to act <\s>
<s> if a public man differs from his party in essentials conscience and honour demand that he should withdraw but if there be no such difference it is incumbent upon him to submit his personal opinion to the general sense <\s>
<s> he therefore who thought the prosecution of the war necessary could not condemn the public imposts on this consequence the steady adherents of ministers rest their claim to approbation and advance it boldly in defiance of the outcry raised against the government on account of the burthens which the situation of europe compelled it to lay upon the people <\s>
<s> in matters of taste it is a process attended with little advantage and often injurious to compare one set of artists or writers with another <\s>
<s> but in estimating the merits of public men especially of two parties acting in direct opposition it is not only expedient but indispensible that both should be kept constantly in sight <\s>
<s> the truth or fallacy of french principles and the tendency good or bad of the revolution which sprang out of them and the necessity or non necessity the policy or impolicy of resisting by war the encroachments of republican and imperial france these were the opposite grounds upon which each party staked their credit here we behold them in full contrast with each other to whom shall the crown be given <\s>
<s> on whom has the light fallen <\s>
<s> and who are covered by shade and thick darkness <\s>
<s> the magnanimity which resolved that for principle's sake no efforts should be spared to crush a bestial despotism was acknowledged by every manly spirit whom party degenerating into faction had not vitiated <\s>
<s> that such was the dictate of confiding wisdom had long been inwardly felt and the prudence of the course was evinced by the triumphant issue but to the very completeness of this triumph may be indirectly attributed no small portion of the obloquy how heaped upon those advisers through whom it was achieved <\s>
<s> the power of napoleon buonaparte was overthrown his person has disappeared from the theatre of europe his name has almost deserted the columns of her daily and weekly journals but as he has left no successor as there is no foreign tyrant of sufficient importance to attract hatred by exciting fear many honest english patriots must either find or set up something at home for the employment of those affections <\s>

<s> till that time comes it will not grieve us that this county should supply two representatives to uphold the servants of the crown even if both should continue through unavoidable circumstances to issue from one family amongst us <\s>
<s> till that change takes place we will treat with scorn the senseless outcry for the recovery of an independence which has never been lost <\s>
<s> we are have been and will remain independent and the host of men respectable on every account who have publicly avowed their desire to maintain our present representatives in their seats deem it insolence to assert the contrary <\s>
<s> they are independent in every rational sense of the word acknowledging however that they rest upon a principle and are incorporated with an interest and this they regard as a proof that their affections are sane and their understandings superior to illusion <\s>
<s> but in certain vocabularies liberty is synonymous with licence and to be free as explained by some is to live and act without restraint <\s>
<s> in like manner independence according to the meaning of their interpretation is the explosive energy of conceit making blind havoc with expediency <\s>
<s> it is a presumptuous spirit at war with all the passive worth of mankind <\s>
<s> the independence which they boast of despises habit and time honoured forms of subordination it consists in breaking old ties upon new temptations in casting off the modest garb of private obligation to strut about in the glittering armour of public virtue in sacrificing with jacobinical infatuation the near to the remote and preferring to what has been known and tried that which has no distinct existence even in imagination in renouncing with voluble tongue and vain heart every thing intricate in motive and mixed in quality in a downright passion of love for absolute unapproachable patriotism <\s>
<s> in short the independence these reformers bawl for is the worthy precursor of the liberty they adore making her first essay by starting out of the course for the pleasure of falling into the ditch and asserting her heaven born vigour by soaring above the level of humanity in profession that it may more conspicuously appear how far she can fall below it in practice <\s>
<s> to this spurious independence the friends of our present representatives lay no claim <\s>
<s> they assert in the face of the world that those representatives hold their seats by free election that has placed them there and why should we wish to change what we do not disapprove of that which could not have been without our approbation <\s>

<s> gentlemen much of my former address originated in deference to that sense of right which is inseparable from the minds of enlightened patriots <\s>
<s> passing from local considerations i wrote under a belief that whatever personal or family leanings might prevail among you you would be moved by a wish to see the supporters of his majesty's ministers and their opponents possessed relatively to each other of that degree of strength which might render both parties in their several capacities most serviceable to the state <\s>
<s> i noticed that this just proportion of strength no longer remained and shewed that the opposition had caused it to be destroyed by holding from the beginning of the french revolution such a course as introduced in parliament discord among themselves deprived them in that house and elsewhere of the respect which from their adversaries they had been accustomed to command turned indifferent persons into enemies and alienated throughout the island the affections of thousands who had been proud to unite with them <\s>
<s> this weakness and degradation deplored by all true friends of the commonweal was sufficiently accounted for without even adverting to the fact that when the disasters of the war had induced the country to forgive and in some degree to forget the alarming attachment of that party to french theories and power heightened by the popularity of hope and expectation was thrown into their hands they disgusted even bigotted adherents by the rapacious use they made of that power stooping to so many offensive compromises and committing so many faults in every department that a government of talents if such be the fruits of talent was proved to be the most mischievous sort of government which england had ever been troubled with <\s>

<s> remember what england might have been with an administration countenancing french doctrines at the dawn of the french revolution and suffering them as it advanced to be sown with every wind that came across the channel <\s>
<s> think what was the state of europe before the french emperor the apparent and in too many respects the real idol of opposition was overthrown <\s>
<s> numbers i am aware do not cease vehemently to maintain that the late war was neither just nor necessary that the ostensible and real causes of it were widely different that it was not begun and persisted in for the purpose of withstanding foreign aggression and in defence of social order but from unprincipled ambition in the powers of europe eager to seize that opportunity of augmenting their territories at the expence of distracted and enfeebled france events ever to be lamented do i grant give too much colour to those affirmations <\s>
<s> but this was a war upon a large scale wherein many belligerents took part and no one who distinctly remembers the state of europe at its commencement will be inclined any more to question that the alleged motives had a solid foundation because then or afterwards others might mix with them than he would doubt that the maintenance of christianity and the reduction of the power of the infidels were the principal motives of the crusades because roving adventurers joining in those expeditions turned them to their own profit <\s>
<s> traders and hypocrites may make part of a caravan bound to mecca but it does not follow that a religious observance is not the prime object of the pilgrimage <\s>
<s> the political fanaticism it deserves no milder name that pervaded the manifesto issued by the duke of brunswick on his entry into france proves that he and the power whose organ he was were swayed on their march by an ambition very different from that of territorial aggrandizement at least if such ambition existed it is plain that feelings of another kind blinded them to the means of gratifying it <\s>
<s> nevertheless we must acknowledge the passion soon manifested itself and in a quarter where it was least excusable <\s>
<s> the seizure of valenciennes in the name of the emperor of germany was an act of such glaring rapacity and gave the lie so unfeelingly to all that had been professed that the then ministers of great britain doubtless opposed the intention with a strong remonstrance <\s>
<s> but the dictates of magnanimity which in such cases is but another word for high and sage policy would have been 'this unjust act must either be abandoned or great britain shall retire from a contest which if such principles are to govern or interfere with the conduct of it cannot but be calamitous <\s>
<s> a threat to this purpose was either not given or not acted upon <\s>
<s> from that moment the alliance of the french loyalists with the coalesced powers seemed to have no ground of rational patriotism to stand upon <\s>
<s> their professed helpers became their worst enemies and numbers among them not only began to wish for the defeat of their false friends but joined themselves to their fellow countrymen of all parties who were labouring to effect it but the military successes of the french arising mainly from this want of principle in the confederate powers in course of time placed the policy and justice of the war upon a new footing <\s>
<s> however men might differ about the necessity or reasonableness of resorting to arms in the first instance things were brought to such a state that among the disinterested and dispassionate there could be but one opinion even if nothing higher than security was aimed at on the demand for the utmost strength of the nation being put forth in the prosecution of the war till it should assume a more hopeful aspect and now it was that ministers made ample amends for past subserviency to selfish coadjutors and proved themselves worthy of being entrusted with the fate of europe <\s>
<s> while the opposition were taking counsel from their fears and recommending despair while they continued to magnify without scruple the strength of the enemy and to expose misrepresent and therefore increase the weaknesses of their country his majesty's ministers were not daunted though often discouraged they struggled up against adversity with fortitude and persevered heroically throwing themselves upon the honour and wisdom of the country and trusting for the issue to the decrees of a just providence and for this determination everlasting gratitude will attend them <\s>
<s> from the internal situation of france produced by the revolution war with the contiguous powers was inevitable sooner or later the evil must have been encountered and it was of little importance whether england took a share in it somewhat earlier than by fallible judgments might be deemed necessary or not <\s>
<s> the frankness with which the faults that were committed have been acknowledged entitles the writer to some regard when speaking from an intimate knowledge of the internal state of france at that time he affirms that the war waged against her was in a liberal interpretation of the words just and necessary <\s>
<s> at all events our nation viewed it in this light <\s>
<s> a large majority of the inhabitants of great britain called for the war and they who will the end will the means the war being deemed necessary taxes became indispensible for its support <\s>
<s> some might prefer one mode of raising them some another but these are minor considerations <\s>
<s> public men united in bodies must act on great principles <\s>
<s> mutual deference is a fundamental requisite for the composition and efficiency of a party for if individual judgment is to be obtruded and insisted upon in subordinate concerns the march of business will be perpetually obstructed <\s>
<s> the leaders will not know whom they can depend upon and therefore will be at a loss what to recommend and how to act <\s>
<s> if a public man differs from his party in essentials conscience and honour demand that he should withdraw but if there be no such difference it is incumbent upon him to submit his personal opinion to the general sense <\s>
<s> he therefore who thought the prosecution of the war necessary could not condemn the public imposts on this consequence the steady adherents of ministers rest their claim to approbation and advance it boldly in defiance of the outcry raised against the government on account of the burthens which the situation of europe compelled it to lay upon the people <\s>
<s> in matters of taste it is a process attended with little advantage and often injurious to compare one set of artists or writers with another <\s>
<s> but in estimating the merits of public men especially of two parties acting in direct opposition it is not only expedient but indispensible that both should be kept constantly in sight <\s>
<s> the truth or fallacy of french principles and the tendency good or bad of the revolution which sprang out of them and the necessity or non necessity the policy or impolicy of resisting by war the encroachments of republican and imperial france these were the opposite grounds upon which each party staked their credit here we behold them in full contrast with each other to whom shall the crown be given <\s>
<s> on whom has the light fallen <\s>
<s> and who are covered by shade and thick darkness <\s>
<s> the magnanimity which resolved that for principle's sake no efforts should be spared to crush a bestial despotism was acknowledged by every manly spirit whom party degenerating into faction had not vitiated <\s>
<s> that such was the dictate of confiding wisdom had long been inwardly felt and the prudence of the course was evinced by the triumphant issue but to the very completeness of this triumph may be indirectly attributed no small portion of the obloquy how heaped upon those advisers through whom it was achieved <\s>
<s> the power of napoleon buonaparte was overthrown his person has disappeared from the theatre of europe his name has almost deserted the columns of her daily and weekly journals but as he has left no successor as there is no foreign tyrant of sufficient importance to attract hatred by exciting fear many honest english patriots must either find or set up something at home for the employment of those affections <\s>
<s> this is too natural to occasion surprise thousands are so framed that they are but languidly conscious of their love of an object unless while they feel themselves in an active state of aversion to something which they can regard as its opposite thus we see men who had been proud of their attachment to his majesty's ministers during the awful struggle as soon as it was over allowing on the first temptation that proud attachment to be converted into immoderate suspicion and a long experienced gratitude into sudden alienation through this infirmity many were betrayed into taking part with the men whom they had heretofore despised or condemned and assisted them in reviling their own government for suffering among the states of the continent institutions to remain which the respective nations surely the best if not the only judges in the case were unwilling to part with and for having permitted things to be done either just and proper in themselves or if indeed abuses abuses of that kind which great britain had neither right to oppose nor power to prevent <\s>
<s> not a frenchman is in arms in spain <\s>
<s> but alas for the credit of the english cabinet ferdinand though a lawful appears to be a sorry king and the inquisition though venerated by the people of spain as a holy tribunal which has spread a protecting shade over their religion for hundreds of years is among protestants an abomination <\s>

<s> if it be praiseworthy to have contributed to cast shoals of our deserving countrymen adrift without regard to their past services that praise cannot be denied him if it be commendable to have availed himself of inordinate momentary passion to carry measures whereby the general weal was sacrificed whether designedly for the attainment of popularity or in the self applauding sincerity of a heated mind that praise is due to mr <\s>
<s> brougham and his coadjutors <\s>
<s> but to the judicious freeholders of westmoreland whether gentry or yeomanry rich or poor he will in vain adduce this or any other part of the recent conduct of opposition as a motive for strengthening their interests amongst us <\s>
<s> no freeholders we must wait assuring them that they shall have a reasonable portion of our support as soon as they have proved that they deserve it <\s>
<s> till that time comes it will not grieve us that this county should supply two representatives to uphold the servants of the crown even if both should continue through unavoidable circumstances to issue from one family amongst us <\s>
<s> till that change takes place we will treat with scorn the senseless outcry for the recovery of an independence which has never been lost <\s>
<s> we are have been and will remain independent and the host of men respectable on every account who have publicly avowed their desire to maintain our present representatives in their seats deem it insolence to assert the contrary <\s>
<s> they are independent in every rational sense of the word acknowledging however that they rest upon a principle and are incorporated with an interest and this they regard as a proof that their affections are sane and their understandings superior to illusion <\s>
<s> but in certain vocabularies liberty is synonymous with licence and to be free as explained by some is to live and act without restraint <\s>
<s> in like manner independence according to the meaning of their interpretation is the explosive energy of conceit making blind havoc with expediency <\s>
<s> it is a presumptuous spirit at war with all the passive worth of mankind <\s>
<s> the independence which they boast of despises habit and time honoured forms of subordination it consists in breaking old ties upon new temptations in casting off the modest garb of private obligation to strut about in the glittering armour of public virtue in sacrificing with jacobinical infatuation the near to the remote and preferring to what has been known and tried that which has no distinct existence even in imagination in renouncing with voluble tongue and vain heart every thing intricate in motive and mixed in quality in a downright passion of love for absolute unapproachable patriotism <\s>
<s> in short the independence these reformers bawl for is the worthy precursor of the liberty they adore making her first essay by starting out of the course for the pleasure of falling into the ditch and asserting her heaven born vigour by soaring above the level of humanity in profession that it may more conspicuously appear how far she can fall below it in practice <\s>
<s> to this spurious independence the friends of our present representatives lay no claim <\s>
<s> they assert in the face of the world that those representatives hold their seats by free election that has placed them there and why should we wish to change what we do not disapprove of that which could not have been without our approbation <\s>
<s> but this county has not for a long time been disturbed by electioneering contests is there no species of choice then but that which is accompanied with commotion and clamour <\s>
<s> do silent acquiescence and deliberate consent pass for nothing <\s>
<s> being contented what could we seek for more <\s>
<s> being satisfied why should we stir for stirring's sake <\s>
<s> uproar and disorder even these we could tolerate on a justifying occasion but it is no sign of prudence to court them unnecessarily nor of temper to invite them wantonly <\s>
<s> he who resorts to substantial unruliness for the redress of imaginary grievances provokes certain mischief and often in the end produces calamity which would excite little compassion could it be confined to its original author <\s>
<s> let those who think that they are degraded proclaim their own dishonour <\s>
<s> gentlemen much of my former address originated in deference to that sense of right which is inseparable from the minds of enlightened patriots <\s>
<s> passing from local considerations i wrote under a belief that whatever personal or family leanings might prevail among you you would be moved by a wish to see the supporters of his majesty's ministers and their opponents possessed relatively to each other of that degree of strength which might render both parties in their several capacities most serviceable to the state <\s>
<s> i noticed that this just proportion of strength no longer remained and shewed that the opposition had caused it to be destroyed by holding from the beginning of the french revolution such a course as introduced in parliament discord among themselves deprived them in that house and elsewhere of the respect which from their adversaries they had been accustomed to command turned indifferent persons into enemies and alienated throughout the island the affections of thousands who had been proud to unite with them <\s>
<s> this weakness and degradation deplored by all true friends of the commonweal was sufficiently accounted for without even adverting to the fact that when the disasters of the war had induced the country to forgive and in some degree to forget the alarming attachment of that party to french theories and power heightened by the popularity of hope and expectation was thrown into their hands they disgusted even bigotted adherents by the rapacious use they made of that power stooping to so many offensive compromises and committing so many faults in every department that a government of talents if such be the fruits of talent was proved to be the most mischievous sort of government which england had ever been troubled with <\s>
<s> so that whether in or out of place an evil genius seemed to attend them <\s>
<s> how could all this happen <\s>
<s> for the fundamental reason that neither the religion the laws the morals the manners nor the literature of the country especially as contrasted with those of france were prized by the leaders of the party as they deserved <\s>
<s> it is a notorious fact that among their personal friends was scarcely to be found a single clergyman of distinction so that how to dispose of their ecclesiastical patronage in a manner that might do them credit they were almost as ignorant as strangers landed for the first time in a foreign country <\s>
<s> this is not to be accounted for on any supposition since the education of men of rank naturally devolves on those members of our universities who choose the church for their profession but that of a repugnance on their part to associate with persons of grave character and decorous manners <\s>
<s> is the distracted remnant of the party now surviving improved in that respect <\s>
<s> the dazzling talents with which it was once distinguished have passed away pleasure and dissipation are no longer in that quarter exhibited to the world in such reconcilement with business as excited dispositions to forgive what could not be approved and a species of wonder not sufficiently kept apart from envy at the extraordinary gifts and powers by which the union was accomplished <\s>
<s> this injurious conjunction no longer exists so as to attract the eyes of the nation <\s>
<s> but we look in vain for signs that the opinions habits and feelings of the party are tending towards a restoration of that genuine english character by which alone the confidence of the sound part of the people can be recovered <\s>
<s> the public life of the candidate who now for the first time solicits your suffrages my brother freeholders cannot however without injustice to that party be deemed a fair exponent of its political opinions <\s>

<s> remember what england might have been with an administration countenancing french doctrines at the dawn of the french revolution and suffering them as it advanced to be sown with every wind that came across the channel <\s>
<s> think what was the state of europe before the french emperor the apparent and in too many respects the real idol of opposition was overthrown <\s>
<s> numbers i am aware do not cease vehemently to maintain that the late war was neither just nor necessary that the ostensible and real causes of it were widely different that it was not begun and persisted in for the purpose of withstanding foreign aggression and in defence of social order but from unprincipled ambition in the powers of europe eager to seize that opportunity of augmenting their territories at the expence of distracted and enfeebled france events ever to be lamented do i grant give too much colour to those affirmations <\s>
<s> but this was a war upon a large scale wherein many belligerents took part and no one who distinctly remembers the state of europe at its commencement will be inclined any more to question that the alleged motives had a solid foundation because then or afterwards others might mix with them than he would doubt that the maintenance of christianity and the reduction of the power of the infidels were the principal motives of the crusades because roving adventurers joining in those expeditions turned them to their own profit <\s>
<s> traders and hypocrites may make part of a caravan bound to mecca but it does not follow that a religious observance is not the prime object of the pilgrimage <\s>
<s> the political fanaticism it deserves no milder name that pervaded the manifesto issued by the duke of brunswick on his entry into france proves that he and the power whose organ he was were swayed on their march by an ambition very different from that of territorial aggrandizement at least if such ambition existed it is plain that feelings of another kind blinded them to the means of gratifying it <\s>
<s> nevertheless we must acknowledge the passion soon manifested itself and in a quarter where it was least excusable <\s>
<s> the seizure of valenciennes in the name of the emperor of germany was an act of such glaring rapacity and gave the lie so unfeelingly to all that had been professed that the then ministers of great britain doubtless opposed the intention with a strong remonstrance <\s>
<s> but the dictates of magnanimity which in such cases is but another word for high and sage policy would have been 'this unjust act must either be abandoned or great britain shall retire from a contest which if such principles are to govern or interfere with the conduct of it cannot but be calamitous <\s>
<s> a threat to this purpose was either not given or not acted upon <\s>
<s> from that moment the alliance of the french loyalists with the coalesced powers seemed to have no ground of rational patriotism to stand upon <\s>
<s> their professed helpers became their worst enemies and numbers among them not only began to wish for the defeat of their false friends but joined themselves to their fellow countrymen of all parties who were labouring to effect it but the military successes of the french arising mainly from this want of principle in the confederate powers in course of time placed the policy and justice of the war upon a new footing <\s>
<s> however men might differ about the necessity or reasonableness of resorting to arms in the first instance things were brought to such a state that among the disinterested and dispassionate there could be but one opinion even if nothing higher than security was aimed at on the demand for the utmost strength of the nation being put forth in the prosecution of the war till it should assume a more hopeful aspect and now it was that ministers made ample amends for past subserviency to selfish coadjutors and proved themselves worthy of being entrusted with the fate of europe <\s>
<s> while the opposition were taking counsel from their fears and recommending despair while they continued to magnify without scruple the strength of the enemy and to expose misrepresent and therefore increase the weaknesses of their country his majesty's ministers were not daunted though often discouraged they struggled up against adversity with fortitude and persevered heroically throwing themselves upon the honour and wisdom of the country and trusting for the issue to the decrees of a just providence and for this determination everlasting gratitude will attend them <\s>
<s> from the internal situation of france produced by the revolution war with the contiguous powers was inevitable sooner or later the evil must have been encountered and it was of little importance whether england took a share in it somewhat earlier than by fallible judgments might be deemed necessary or not <\s>
<s> the frankness with which the faults that were committed have been acknowledged entitles the writer to some regard when speaking from an intimate knowledge of the internal state of france at that time he affirms that the war waged against her was in a liberal interpretation of the words just and necessary <\s>
<s> at all events our nation viewed it in this light <\s>
<s> a large majority of the inhabitants of great britain called for the war and they who will the end will the means the war being deemed necessary taxes became indispensible for its support <\s>
<s> some might prefer one mode of raising them some another but these are minor considerations <\s>
<s> public men united in bodies must act on great principles <\s>
<s> mutual deference is a fundamental requisite for the composition and efficiency of a party for if individual judgment is to be obtruded and insisted upon in subordinate concerns the march of business will be perpetually obstructed <\s>
<s> the leaders will not know whom they can depend upon and therefore will be at a loss what to recommend and how to act <\s>
<s> if a public man differs from his party in essentials conscience and honour demand that he should withdraw but if there be no such difference it is incumbent upon him to submit his personal opinion to the general sense <\s>
<s> he therefore who thought the prosecution of the war necessary could not condemn the public imposts on this consequence the steady adherents of ministers rest their claim to approbation and advance it boldly in defiance of the outcry raised against the government on account of the burthens which the situation of europe compelled it to lay upon the people <\s>
<s> in matters of taste it is a process attended with little advantage and often injurious to compare one set of artists or writers with another <\s>
<s> but in estimating the merits of public men especially of two parties acting in direct opposition it is not only expedient but indispensible that both should be kept constantly in sight <\s>
<s> the truth or fallacy of french principles and the tendency good or bad of the revolution which sprang out of them and the necessity or non necessity the policy or impolicy of resisting by war the encroachments of republican and imperial france these were the opposite grounds upon which each party staked their credit here we behold them in full contrast with each other to whom shall the crown be given <\s>
<s> on whom has the light fallen <\s>
<s> and who are covered by shade and thick darkness <\s>
<s> the magnanimity which resolved that for principle's sake no efforts should be spared to crush a bestial despotism was acknowledged by every manly spirit whom party degenerating into faction had not vitiated <\s>
<s> that such was the dictate of confiding wisdom had long been inwardly felt and the prudence of the course was evinced by the triumphant issue but to the very completeness of this triumph may be indirectly attributed no small portion of the obloquy how heaped upon those advisers through whom it was achieved <\s>
<s> the power of napoleon buonaparte was overthrown his person has disappeared from the theatre of europe his name has almost deserted the columns of her daily and weekly journals but as he has left no successor as there is no foreign tyrant of sufficient importance to attract hatred by exciting fear many honest english patriots must either find or set up something at home for the employment of those affections <\s>
<s> this is too natural to occasion surprise thousands are so framed that they are but languidly conscious of their love of an object unless while they feel themselves in an active state of aversion to something which they can regard as its opposite thus we see men who had been proud of their attachment to his majesty's ministers during the awful struggle as soon as it was over allowing on the first temptation that proud attachment to be converted into immoderate suspicion and a long experienced gratitude into sudden alienation through this infirmity many were betrayed into taking part with the men whom they had heretofore despised or condemned and assisted them in reviling their own government for suffering among the states of the continent institutions to remain which the respective nations surely the best if not the only judges in the case were unwilling to part with and for having permitted things to be done either just and proper in themselves or if indeed abuses abuses of that kind which great britain had neither right to oppose nor power to prevent <\s>
<s> not a frenchman is in arms in spain <\s>
<s> but alas for the credit of the english cabinet ferdinand though a lawful appears to be a sorry king and the inquisition though venerated by the people of spain as a holy tribunal which has spread a protecting shade over their religion for hundreds of years is among protestants an abomination <\s>
<s> is that however a reason why we should not rejoice that spain is restored to the rank of an independent nation and that her resources do not continue at the disposal of a foreign tyrant for the annoyance of great britain <\s>
<s> prussia no longer receives decrees from the tuilleries but nothing we are told is gained by this deliverance because the sovereign of that country has not participated as far as became him a popular effervescence and has withheld from his subjects certain privileges which they have proved themselves to all but heated judgments not yet qualified to receive <\s>
<s> now if numbers can blame without cause the british cabinet for events falling below their wishes in cases remote from their immediate concerns the reasonableness of their opinions may well be questioned in points where selfish passion is touched to the quick yes in spite of the outcry of such men to the contrary every enlightened politician and discerning patriot however diffident as to what was the exact line of prudence in such arduous circumstances will reprobate the conduct of those who were for reducing public expenditure with a precipitation that might have produced a convulsion in the state <\s>
<s> the habeas corpus act is also our own near concern it was suspended some think without sufficient cause not so however the persons who had the best means of ascertaining the state of the country for they could have been induced to have recourse to a measure at all times so obnoxious by nothing less than a persuasion of its expediency <\s>
<s> but persuasion an objector will say is produced in many ways and even that degree of it which in these matters passes for conviction depends less upon external testimony than on the habits and feelings of those by whom the testimony is to be weighed and decided upon <\s>
<s> a council for the administration of affairs is far from being as favourably circumstanced as a tribunal of law for the party which is to pronounce upon the case has had to procure the evidence the sum and quality of which must needs have been affected by previously existing prejudices and by any bias received in the process of collecting it the privileges of the subject one might think would never be unjustifiably infringed if it were only from considerations of self interest but power is apt to resort to unnecessary rigour in order to supply the deficiencies of authority forfeited by remissness it is also not unfrequently exerted merely to shew that it is possessed to shew this to others while power is a novelty and when it has long ceased to be so to prove it to ourselves <\s>

<s> brougham and his coadjutors <\s>
<s> but to the judicious freeholders of westmoreland whether gentry or yeomanry rich or poor he will in vain adduce this or any other part of the recent conduct of opposition as a motive for strengthening their interests amongst us <\s>
<s> no freeholders we must wait assuring them that they shall have a reasonable portion of our support as soon as they have proved that they deserve it <\s>
<s> till that time comes it will not grieve us that this county should supply two representatives to uphold the servants of the crown even if both should continue through unavoidable circumstances to issue from one family amongst us <\s>
<s> till that change takes place we will treat with scorn the senseless outcry for the recovery of an independence which has never been lost <\s>
<s> we are have been and will remain independent and the host of men respectable on every account who have publicly avowed their desire to maintain our present representatives in their seats deem it insolence to assert the contrary <\s>
<s> they are independent in every rational sense of the word acknowledging however that they rest upon a principle and are incorporated with an interest and this they regard as a proof that their affections are sane and their understandings superior to illusion <\s>
<s> but in certain vocabularies liberty is synonymous with licence and to be free as explained by some is to live and act without restraint <\s>
<s> in like manner independence according to the meaning of their interpretation is the explosive energy of conceit making blind havoc with expediency <\s>
<s> it is a presumptuous spirit at war with all the passive worth of mankind <\s>
<s> the independence which they boast of despises habit and time honoured forms of subordination it consists in breaking old ties upon new temptations in casting off the modest garb of private obligation to strut about in the glittering armour of public virtue in sacrificing with jacobinical infatuation the near to the remote and preferring to what has been known and tried that which has no distinct existence even in imagination in renouncing with voluble tongue and vain heart every thing intricate in motive and mixed in quality in a downright passion of love for absolute unapproachable patriotism <\s>
<s> in short the independence these reformers bawl for is the worthy precursor of the liberty they adore making her first essay by starting out of the course for the pleasure of falling into the ditch and asserting her heaven born vigour by soaring above the level of humanity in profession that it may more conspicuously appear how far she can fall below it in practice <\s>
<s> to this spurious independence the friends of our present representatives lay no claim <\s>
<s> they assert in the face of the world that those representatives hold their seats by free election that has placed them there and why should we wish to change what we do not disapprove of that which could not have been without our approbation <\s>

<s> gentlemen much of my former address originated in deference to that sense of right which is inseparable from the minds of enlightened patriots <\s>
<s> passing from local considerations i wrote under a belief that whatever personal or family leanings might prevail among you you would be moved by a wish to see the supporters of his majesty's ministers and their opponents possessed relatively to each other of that degree of strength which might render both parties in their several capacities most serviceable to the state <\s>
<s> i noticed that this just proportion of strength no longer remained and shewed that the opposition had caused it to be destroyed by holding from the beginning of the french revolution such a course as introduced in parliament discord among themselves deprived them in that house and elsewhere of the respect which from their adversaries they had been accustomed to command turned indifferent persons into enemies and alienated throughout the island the affections of thousands who had been proud to unite with them <\s>
<s> this weakness and degradation deplored by all true friends of the commonweal was sufficiently accounted for without even adverting to the fact that when the disasters of the war had induced the country to forgive and in some degree to forget the alarming attachment of that party to french theories and power heightened by the popularity of hope and expectation was thrown into their hands they disgusted even bigotted adherents by the rapacious use they made of that power stooping to so many offensive compromises and committing so many faults in every department that a government of talents if such be the fruits of talent was proved to be the most mischievous sort of government which england had ever been troubled with <\s>
<s> so that whether in or out of place an evil genius seemed to attend them <\s>
<s> how could all this happen <\s>
<s> for the fundamental reason that neither the religion the laws the morals the manners nor the literature of the country especially as contrasted with those of france were prized by the leaders of the party as they deserved <\s>
<s> it is a notorious fact that among their personal friends was scarcely to be found a single clergyman of distinction so that how to dispose of their ecclesiastical patronage in a manner that might do them credit they were almost as ignorant as strangers landed for the first time in a foreign country <\s>
<s> this is not to be accounted for on any supposition since the education of men of rank naturally devolves on those members of our universities who choose the church for their profession but that of a repugnance on their part to associate with persons of grave character and decorous manners <\s>
<s> is the distracted remnant of the party now surviving improved in that respect <\s>
<s> the dazzling talents with which it was once distinguished have passed away pleasure and dissipation are no longer in that quarter exhibited to the world in such reconcilement with business as excited dispositions to forgive what could not be approved and a species of wonder not sufficiently kept apart from envy at the extraordinary gifts and powers by which the union was accomplished <\s>
<s> this injurious conjunction no longer exists so as to attract the eyes of the nation <\s>
<s> but we look in vain for signs that the opinions habits and feelings of the party are tending towards a restoration of that genuine english character by which alone the confidence of the sound part of the people can be recovered <\s>
<s> the public life of the candidate who now for the first time solicits your suffrages my brother freeholders cannot however without injustice to that party be deemed a fair exponent of its political opinions <\s>
<s> it has indeed been too tolerant with mr <\s>
<s> brougham while he was labouring to ingraft certain sour cuttings from the wild wood of ultra reform on the reverend though somewhat decayed stock of that tree of whiggism which flourished proudly under the cultivation of our ancestors <\s>
<s> this indulgence and others like it will embolden him to aim at passing himself off as the delegate of opposition and the authorized pleader of their cause <\s>
<s> but time that judge from whom none but triflers appeal to conjecture has decided upon leading principles and main events and given the verdict against his clients <\s>
<s> while with a ready tongue the advocate of a disappointed party is filling one scale do you with a clear memory and apt judgment silently throw in what of right belongs to the other and the result will be that no sensible man among you who has supported the present members on account of their steady adherence to ministers can be induced to change his conduct or be persuaded that the hour is either come or approaching when for the sake of bringing the power of opposition in this county nearer to an equality with that of ministers it will be his duty to vote against those representatives in whom he has hitherto confided <\s>
<s> brougham had not individually passed far beyond the line of that party if his conduct had been such that even they themselves would admit that he truly belonged to them the exception would still lie against the general rule and will remain till the character of men and measures materially changes for the better assuredly on the one side if not for the worse on the other <\s>

<s> however men might differ about the necessity or reasonableness of resorting to arms in the first instance things were brought to such a state that among the disinterested and dispassionate there could be but one opinion even if nothing higher than security was aimed at on the demand for the utmost strength of the nation being put forth in the prosecution of the war till it should assume a more hopeful aspect and now it was that ministers made ample amends for past subserviency to selfish coadjutors and proved themselves worthy of being entrusted with the fate of europe <\s>
<s> while the opposition were taking counsel from their fears and recommending despair while they continued to magnify without scruple the strength of the enemy and to expose misrepresent and therefore increase the weaknesses of their country his majesty's ministers were not daunted though often discouraged they struggled up against adversity with fortitude and persevered heroically throwing themselves upon the honour and wisdom of the country and trusting for the issue to the decrees of a just providence and for this determination everlasting gratitude will attend them <\s>

<s> in matters of taste it is a process attended with little advantage and often injurious to compare one set of artists or writers with another <\s>

<s> the truth or fallacy of french principles and the tendency good or bad of the revolution which sprang out of them and the necessity or non necessity the policy or impolicy of resisting by war the encroachments of republican and imperial france these were the opposite grounds upon which each party staked their credit here we behold them in full contrast with each other to whom shall the crown be given <\s>

<s> this is too natural to occasion surprise thousands are so framed that they are but languidly conscious of their love of an object unless while they feel themselves in an active state of aversion to something which they can regard as its opposite thus we see men who had been proud of their attachment to his majesty's ministers during the awful struggle as soon as it was over allowing on the first temptation that proud attachment to be converted into immoderate suspicion and a long experienced gratitude into sudden alienation through this infirmity many were betrayed into taking part with the men whom they had heretofore despised or condemned and assisted them in reviling their own government for suffering among the states of the continent institutions to remain which the respective nations surely the best if not the only judges in the case were unwilling to part with and for having permitted things to be done either just and proper in themselves or if indeed abuses abuses of that kind which great britain had neither right to oppose nor power to prevent <\s>

<s> now if numbers can blame without cause the british cabinet for events falling below their wishes in cases remote from their immediate concerns the reasonableness of their opinions may well be questioned in points where selfish passion is touched to the quick yes in spite of the outcry of such men to the contrary every enlightened politician and discerning patriot however diffident as to what was the exact line of prudence in such arduous circumstances will reprobate the conduct of those who were for reducing public expenditure with a precipitation that might have produced a convulsion in the state <\s>
<s> the habeas corpus act is also our own near concern it was suspended some think without sufficient cause not so however the persons who had the best means of ascertaining the state of the country for they could have been induced to have recourse to a measure at all times so obnoxious by nothing less than a persuasion of its expediency <\s>

<s> happily for the inhabitants of westmoreland as no dispositions existing among them could furnish a motive for this restrictive measure so they will not be sorry that their remoteness from scenes of public confusion has placed them where they will be slow to give an unqualified opinion upon its merits <\s>
<s> yet it will not escape their discernment that if doubts might have been entertained whether the ignorant and distressed multitude in other parts of the island were actually brought to a state that justified the suspension of this law such doubts must have been weakened if not wholly removed by the subsequent behaviour of those in the upper ranks of society who in order to arraign the government and denounce the laws have seized every opportunity of palliating sedition if not of exculpating treason <\s>

<s> till that time comes it will not grieve us that this county should supply two representatives to uphold the servants of the crown even if both should continue through unavoidable circumstances to issue from one family amongst us <\s>
<s> till that change takes place we will treat with scorn the senseless outcry for the recovery of an independence which has never been lost <\s>
<s> we are have been and will remain independent and the host of men respectable on every account who have publicly avowed their desire to maintain our present representatives in their seats deem it insolence to assert the contrary <\s>
<s> they are independent in every rational sense of the word acknowledging however that they rest upon a principle and are incorporated with an interest and this they regard as a proof that their affections are sane and their understandings superior to illusion <\s>
<s> but in certain vocabularies liberty is synonymous with licence and to be free as explained by some is to live and act without restraint <\s>
<s> in like manner independence according to the meaning of their interpretation is the explosive energy of conceit making blind havoc with expediency <\s>
<s> it is a presumptuous spirit at war with all the passive worth of mankind <\s>
<s> the independence which they boast of despises habit and time honoured forms of subordination it consists in breaking old ties upon new temptations in casting off the modest garb of private obligation to strut about in the glittering armour of public virtue in sacrificing with jacobinical infatuation the near to the remote and preferring to what has been known and tried that which has no distinct existence even in imagination in renouncing with voluble tongue and vain heart every thing intricate in motive and mixed in quality in a downright passion of love for absolute unapproachable patriotism <\s>
<s> in short the independence these reformers bawl for is the worthy precursor of the liberty they adore making her first essay by starting out of the course for the pleasure of falling into the ditch and asserting her heaven born vigour by soaring above the level of humanity in profession that it may more conspicuously appear how far she can fall below it in practice <\s>
<s> to this spurious independence the friends of our present representatives lay no claim <\s>
<s> they assert in the face of the world that those representatives hold their seats by free election that has placed them there and why should we wish to change what we do not disapprove of that which could not have been without our approbation <\s>

<s> let those who think that they are degraded proclaim their own dishonour <\s>
<s> gentlemen much of my former address originated in deference to that sense of right which is inseparable from the minds of enlightened patriots <\s>
<s> passing from local considerations i wrote under a belief that whatever personal or family leanings might prevail among you you would be moved by a wish to see the supporters of his majesty's ministers and their opponents possessed relatively to each other of that degree of strength which might render both parties in their several capacities most serviceable to the state <\s>
<s> i noticed that this just proportion of strength no longer remained and shewed that the opposition had caused it to be destroyed by holding from the beginning of the french revolution such a course as introduced in parliament discord among themselves deprived them in that house and elsewhere of the respect which from their adversaries they had been accustomed to command turned indifferent persons into enemies and alienated throughout the island the affections of thousands who had been proud to unite with them <\s>
<s> this weakness and degradation deplored by all true friends of the commonweal was sufficiently accounted for without even adverting to the fact that when the disasters of the war had induced the country to forgive and in some degree to forget the alarming attachment of that party to french theories and power heightened by the popularity of hope and expectation was thrown into their hands they disgusted even bigotted adherents by the rapacious use they made of that power stooping to so many offensive compromises and committing so many faults in every department that a government of talents if such be the fruits of talent was proved to be the most mischievous sort of government which england had ever been troubled with <\s>
<s> so that whether in or out of place an evil genius seemed to attend them <\s>
<s> how could all this happen <\s>
<s> for the fundamental reason that neither the religion the laws the morals the manners nor the literature of the country especially as contrasted with those of france were prized by the leaders of the party as they deserved <\s>
<s> it is a notorious fact that among their personal friends was scarcely to be found a single clergyman of distinction so that how to dispose of their ecclesiastical patronage in a manner that might do them credit they were almost as ignorant as strangers landed for the first time in a foreign country <\s>
<s> this is not to be accounted for on any supposition since the education of men of rank naturally devolves on those members of our universities who choose the church for their profession but that of a repugnance on their part to associate with persons of grave character and decorous manners <\s>
<s> is the distracted remnant of the party now surviving improved in that respect <\s>
<s> the dazzling talents with which it was once distinguished have passed away pleasure and dissipation are no longer in that quarter exhibited to the world in such reconcilement with business as excited dispositions to forgive what could not be approved and a species of wonder not sufficiently kept apart from envy at the extraordinary gifts and powers by which the union was accomplished <\s>
<s> this injurious conjunction no longer exists so as to attract the eyes of the nation <\s>
<s> but we look in vain for signs that the opinions habits and feelings of the party are tending towards a restoration of that genuine english character by which alone the confidence of the sound part of the people can be recovered <\s>
<s> the public life of the candidate who now for the first time solicits your suffrages my brother freeholders cannot however without injustice to that party be deemed a fair exponent of its political opinions <\s>
<s> it has indeed been too tolerant with mr <\s>
<s> brougham while he was labouring to ingraft certain sour cuttings from the wild wood of ultra reform on the reverend though somewhat decayed stock of that tree of whiggism which flourished proudly under the cultivation of our ancestors <\s>
<s> this indulgence and others like it will embolden him to aim at passing himself off as the delegate of opposition and the authorized pleader of their cause <\s>
<s> but time that judge from whom none but triflers appeal to conjecture has decided upon leading principles and main events and given the verdict against his clients <\s>
<s> while with a ready tongue the advocate of a disappointed party is filling one scale do you with a clear memory and apt judgment silently throw in what of right belongs to the other and the result will be that no sensible man among you who has supported the present members on account of their steady adherence to ministers can be induced to change his conduct or be persuaded that the hour is either come or approaching when for the sake of bringing the power of opposition in this county nearer to an equality with that of ministers it will be his duty to vote against those representatives in whom he has hitherto confided <\s>
<s> brougham had not individually passed far beyond the line of that party if his conduct had been such that even they themselves would admit that he truly belonged to them the exception would still lie against the general rule and will remain till the character of men and measures materially changes for the better assuredly on the one side if not for the worse on the other <\s>
<s> remember what england might have been with an administration countenancing french doctrines at the dawn of the french revolution and suffering them as it advanced to be sown with every wind that came across the channel <\s>
<s> think what was the state of europe before the french emperor the apparent and in too many respects the real idol of opposition was overthrown <\s>
<s> numbers i am aware do not cease vehemently to maintain that the late war was neither just nor necessary that the ostensible and real causes of it were widely different that it was not begun and persisted in for the purpose of withstanding foreign aggression and in defence of social order but from unprincipled ambition in the powers of europe eager to seize that opportunity of augmenting their territories at the expence of distracted and enfeebled france events ever to be lamented do i grant give too much colour to those affirmations <\s>
<s> but this was a war upon a large scale wherein many belligerents took part and no one who distinctly remembers the state of europe at its commencement will be inclined any more to question that the alleged motives had a solid foundation because then or afterwards others might mix with them than he would doubt that the maintenance of christianity and the reduction of the power of the infidels were the principal motives of the crusades because roving adventurers joining in those expeditions turned them to their own profit <\s>
<s> traders and hypocrites may make part of a caravan bound to mecca but it does not follow that a religious observance is not the prime object of the pilgrimage <\s>
<s> the political fanaticism it deserves no milder name that pervaded the manifesto issued by the duke of brunswick on his entry into france proves that he and the power whose organ he was were swayed on their march by an ambition very different from that of territorial aggrandizement at least if such ambition existed it is plain that feelings of another kind blinded them to the means of gratifying it <\s>

<s> let those who think that they are degraded proclaim their own dishonour <\s>
<s> gentlemen much of my former address originated in deference to that sense of right which is inseparable from the minds of enlightened patriots <\s>
<s> passing from local considerations i wrote under a belief that whatever personal or family leanings might prevail among you you would be moved by a wish to see the supporters of his majesty's ministers and their opponents possessed relatively to each other of that degree of strength which might render both parties in their several capacities most serviceable to the state <\s>
<s> i noticed that this just proportion of strength no longer remained and shewed that the opposition had caused it to be destroyed by holding from the beginning of the french revolution such a course as introduced in parliament discord among themselves deprived them in that house and elsewhere of the respect which from their adversaries they had been accustomed to command turned indifferent persons into enemies and alienated throughout the island the affections of thousands who had been proud to unite with them <\s>
<s> this weakness and degradation deplored by all true friends of the commonweal was sufficiently accounted for without even adverting to the fact that when the disasters of the war had induced the country to forgive and in some degree to forget the alarming attachment of that party to french theories and power heightened by the popularity of hope and expectation was thrown into their hands they disgusted even bigotted adherents by the rapacious use they made of that power stooping to so many offensive compromises and committing so many faults in every department that a government of talents if such be the fruits of talent was proved to be the most mischievous sort of government which england had ever been troubled with <\s>
<s> so that whether in or out of place an evil genius seemed to attend them <\s>
<s> how could all this happen <\s>
<s> for the fundamental reason that neither the religion the laws the morals the manners nor the literature of the country especially as contrasted with those of france were prized by the leaders of the party as they deserved <\s>
<s> it is a notorious fact that among their personal friends was scarcely to be found a single clergyman of distinction so that how to dispose of their ecclesiastical patronage in a manner that might do them credit they were almost as ignorant as strangers landed for the first time in a foreign country <\s>
<s> this is not to be accounted for on any supposition since the education of men of rank naturally devolves on those members of our universities who choose the church for their profession but that of a repugnance on their part to associate with persons of grave character and decorous manners <\s>
<s> is the distracted remnant of the party now surviving improved in that respect <\s>
<s> the dazzling talents with which it was once distinguished have passed away pleasure and dissipation are no longer in that quarter exhibited to the world in such reconcilement with business as excited dispositions to forgive what could not be approved and a species of wonder not sufficiently kept apart from envy at the extraordinary gifts and powers by which the union was accomplished <\s>
<s> this injurious conjunction no longer exists so as to attract the eyes of the nation <\s>
<s> but we look in vain for signs that the opinions habits and feelings of the party are tending towards a restoration of that genuine english character by which alone the confidence of the sound part of the people can be recovered <\s>
<s> the public life of the candidate who now for the first time solicits your suffrages my brother freeholders cannot however without injustice to that party be deemed a fair exponent of its political opinions <\s>
<s> it has indeed been too tolerant with mr <\s>
<s> brougham while he was labouring to ingraft certain sour cuttings from the wild wood of ultra reform on the reverend though somewhat decayed stock of that tree of whiggism which flourished proudly under the cultivation of our ancestors <\s>
<s> this indulgence and others like it will embolden him to aim at passing himself off as the delegate of opposition and the authorized pleader of their cause <\s>
<s> but time that judge from whom none but triflers appeal to conjecture has decided upon leading principles and main events and given the verdict against his clients <\s>
<s> while with a ready tongue the advocate of a disappointed party is filling one scale do you with a clear memory and apt judgment silently throw in what of right belongs to the other and the result will be that no sensible man among you who has supported the present members on account of their steady adherence to ministers can be induced to change his conduct or be persuaded that the hour is either come or approaching when for the sake of bringing the power of opposition in this county nearer to an equality with that of ministers it will be his duty to vote against those representatives in whom he has hitherto confided <\s>
<s> brougham had not individually passed far beyond the line of that party if his conduct had been such that even they themselves would admit that he truly belonged to them the exception would still lie against the general rule and will remain till the character of men and measures materially changes for the better assuredly on the one side if not for the worse on the other <\s>
<s> remember what england might have been with an administration countenancing french doctrines at the dawn of the french revolution and suffering them as it advanced to be sown with every wind that came across the channel <\s>
<s> think what was the state of europe before the french emperor the apparent and in too many respects the real idol of opposition was overthrown <\s>
<s> numbers i am aware do not cease vehemently to maintain that the late war was neither just nor necessary that the ostensible and real causes of it were widely different that it was not begun and persisted in for the purpose of withstanding foreign aggression and in defence of social order but from unprincipled ambition in the powers of europe eager to seize that opportunity of augmenting their territories at the expence of distracted and enfeebled france events ever to be lamented do i grant give too much colour to those affirmations <\s>
<s> but this was a war upon a large scale wherein many belligerents took part and no one who distinctly remembers the state of europe at its commencement will be inclined any more to question that the alleged motives had a solid foundation because then or afterwards others might mix with them than he would doubt that the maintenance of christianity and the reduction of the power of the infidels were the principal motives of the crusades because roving adventurers joining in those expeditions turned them to their own profit <\s>
<s> traders and hypocrites may make part of a caravan bound to mecca but it does not follow that a religious observance is not the prime object of the pilgrimage <\s>
<s> the political fanaticism it deserves no milder name that pervaded the manifesto issued by the duke of brunswick on his entry into france proves that he and the power whose organ he was were swayed on their march by an ambition very different from that of territorial aggrandizement at least if such ambition existed it is plain that feelings of another kind blinded them to the means of gratifying it <\s>
<s> nevertheless we must acknowledge the passion soon manifested itself and in a quarter where it was least excusable <\s>
<s> the seizure of valenciennes in the name of the emperor of germany was an act of such glaring rapacity and gave the lie so unfeelingly to all that had been professed that the then ministers of great britain doubtless opposed the intention with a strong remonstrance <\s>
<s> but the dictates of magnanimity which in such cases is but another word for high and sage policy would have been 'this unjust act must either be abandoned or great britain shall retire from a contest which if such principles are to govern or interfere with the conduct of it cannot but be calamitous <\s>
<s> a threat to this purpose was either not given or not acted upon <\s>
<s> from that moment the alliance of the french loyalists with the coalesced powers seemed to have no ground of rational patriotism to stand upon <\s>
<s> their professed helpers became their worst enemies and numbers among them not only began to wish for the defeat of their false friends but joined themselves to their fellow countrymen of all parties who were labouring to effect it but the military successes of the french arising mainly from this want of principle in the confederate powers in course of time placed the policy and justice of the war upon a new footing <\s>
<s> however men might differ about the necessity or reasonableness of resorting to arms in the first instance things were brought to such a state that among the disinterested and dispassionate there could be but one opinion even if nothing higher than security was aimed at on the demand for the utmost strength of the nation being put forth in the prosecution of the war till it should assume a more hopeful aspect and now it was that ministers made ample amends for past subserviency to selfish coadjutors and proved themselves worthy of being entrusted with the fate of europe <\s>
<s> while the opposition were taking counsel from their fears and recommending despair while they continued to magnify without scruple the strength of the enemy and to expose misrepresent and therefore increase the weaknesses of their country his majesty's ministers were not daunted though often discouraged they struggled up against adversity with fortitude and persevered heroically throwing themselves upon the honour and wisdom of the country and trusting for the issue to the decrees of a just providence and for this determination everlasting gratitude will attend them <\s>

<s> passing from local considerations i wrote under a belief that whatever personal or family leanings might prevail among you you would be moved by a wish to see the supporters of his majesty's ministers and their opponents possessed relatively to each other of that degree of strength which might render both parties in their several capacities most serviceable to the state <\s>
<s> i noticed that this just proportion of strength no longer remained and shewed that the opposition had caused it to be destroyed by holding from the beginning of the french revolution such a course as introduced in parliament discord among themselves deprived them in that house and elsewhere of the respect which from their adversaries they had been accustomed to command turned indifferent persons into enemies and alienated throughout the island the affections of thousands who had been proud to unite with them <\s>
<s> this weakness and degradation deplored by all true friends of the commonweal was sufficiently accounted for without even adverting to the fact that when the disasters of the war had induced the country to forgive and in some degree to forget the alarming attachment of that party to french theories and power heightened by the popularity of hope and expectation was thrown into their hands they disgusted even bigotted adherents by the rapacious use they made of that power stooping to so many offensive compromises and committing so many faults in every department that a government of talents if such be the fruits of talent was proved to be the most mischievous sort of government which england had ever been troubled with <\s>
<s> so that whether in or out of place an evil genius seemed to attend them <\s>
<s> how could all this happen <\s>
<s> for the fundamental reason that neither the religion the laws the morals the manners nor the literature of the country especially as contrasted with those of france were prized by the leaders of the party as they deserved <\s>
<s> it is a notorious fact that among their personal friends was scarcely to be found a single clergyman of distinction so that how to dispose of their ecclesiastical patronage in a manner that might do them credit they were almost as ignorant as strangers landed for the first time in a foreign country <\s>
<s> this is not to be accounted for on any supposition since the education of men of rank naturally devolves on those members of our universities who choose the church for their profession but that of a repugnance on their part to associate with persons of grave character and decorous manners <\s>
<s> is the distracted remnant of the party now surviving improved in that respect <\s>
<s> the dazzling talents with which it was once distinguished have passed away pleasure and dissipation are no longer in that quarter exhibited to the world in such reconcilement with business as excited dispositions to forgive what could not be approved and a species of wonder not sufficiently kept apart from envy at the extraordinary gifts and powers by which the union was accomplished <\s>
<s> this injurious conjunction no longer exists so as to attract the eyes of the nation <\s>
<s> but we look in vain for signs that the opinions habits and feelings of the party are tending towards a restoration of that genuine english character by which alone the confidence of the sound part of the people can be recovered <\s>
<s> the public life of the candidate who now for the first time solicits your suffrages my brother freeholders cannot however without injustice to that party be deemed a fair exponent of its political opinions <\s>
<s> it has indeed been too tolerant with mr <\s>
<s> brougham while he was labouring to ingraft certain sour cuttings from the wild wood of ultra reform on the reverend though somewhat decayed stock of that tree of whiggism which flourished proudly under the cultivation of our ancestors <\s>
<s> this indulgence and others like it will embolden him to aim at passing himself off as the delegate of opposition and the authorized pleader of their cause <\s>
<s> but time that judge from whom none but triflers appeal to conjecture has decided upon leading principles and main events and given the verdict against his clients <\s>
<s> while with a ready tongue the advocate of a disappointed party is filling one scale do you with a clear memory and apt judgment silently throw in what of right belongs to the other and the result will be that no sensible man among you who has supported the present members on account of their steady adherence to ministers can be induced to change his conduct or be persuaded that the hour is either come or approaching when for the sake of bringing the power of opposition in this county nearer to an equality with that of ministers it will be his duty to vote against those representatives in whom he has hitherto confided <\s>
<s> brougham had not individually passed far beyond the line of that party if his conduct had been such that even they themselves would admit that he truly belonged to them the exception would still lie against the general rule and will remain till the character of men and measures materially changes for the better assuredly on the one side if not for the worse on the other <\s>
<s> remember what england might have been with an administration countenancing french doctrines at the dawn of the french revolution and suffering them as it advanced to be sown with every wind that came across the channel <\s>
<s> think what was the state of europe before the french emperor the apparent and in too many respects the real idol of opposition was overthrown <\s>
<s> numbers i am aware do not cease vehemently to maintain that the late war was neither just nor necessary that the ostensible and real causes of it were widely different that it was not begun and persisted in for the purpose of withstanding foreign aggression and in defence of social order but from unprincipled ambition in the powers of europe eager to seize that opportunity of augmenting their territories at the expence of distracted and enfeebled france events ever to be lamented do i grant give too much colour to those affirmations <\s>
<s> but this was a war upon a large scale wherein many belligerents took part and no one who distinctly remembers the state of europe at its commencement will be inclined any more to question that the alleged motives had a solid foundation because then or afterwards others might mix with them than he would doubt that the maintenance of christianity and the reduction of the power of the infidels were the principal motives of the crusades because roving adventurers joining in those expeditions turned them to their own profit <\s>
<s> traders and hypocrites may make part of a caravan bound to mecca but it does not follow that a religious observance is not the prime object of the pilgrimage <\s>
<s> the political fanaticism it deserves no milder name that pervaded the manifesto issued by the duke of brunswick on his entry into france proves that he and the power whose organ he was were swayed on their march by an ambition very different from that of territorial aggrandizement at least if such ambition existed it is plain that feelings of another kind blinded them to the means of gratifying it <\s>
<s> nevertheless we must acknowledge the passion soon manifested itself and in a quarter where it was least excusable <\s>
<s> the seizure of valenciennes in the name of the emperor of germany was an act of such glaring rapacity and gave the lie so unfeelingly to all that had been professed that the then ministers of great britain doubtless opposed the intention with a strong remonstrance <\s>
<s> but the dictates of magnanimity which in such cases is but another word for high and sage policy would have been 'this unjust act must either be abandoned or great britain shall retire from a contest which if such principles are to govern or interfere with the conduct of it cannot but be calamitous <\s>
<s> a threat to this purpose was either not given or not acted upon <\s>
<s> from that moment the alliance of the french loyalists with the coalesced powers seemed to have no ground of rational patriotism to stand upon <\s>
<s> their professed helpers became their worst enemies and numbers among them not only began to wish for the defeat of their false friends but joined themselves to their fellow countrymen of all parties who were labouring to effect it but the military successes of the french arising mainly from this want of principle in the confederate powers in course of time placed the policy and justice of the war upon a new footing <\s>
<s> however men might differ about the necessity or reasonableness of resorting to arms in the first instance things were brought to such a state that among the disinterested and dispassionate there could be but one opinion even if nothing higher than security was aimed at on the demand for the utmost strength of the nation being put forth in the prosecution of the war till it should assume a more hopeful aspect and now it was that ministers made ample amends for past subserviency to selfish coadjutors and proved themselves worthy of being entrusted with the fate of europe <\s>
<s> while the opposition were taking counsel from their fears and recommending despair while they continued to magnify without scruple the strength of the enemy and to expose misrepresent and therefore increase the weaknesses of their country his majesty's ministers were not daunted though often discouraged they struggled up against adversity with fortitude and persevered heroically throwing themselves upon the honour and wisdom of the country and trusting for the issue to the decrees of a just providence and for this determination everlasting gratitude will attend them <\s>
<s> from the internal situation of france produced by the revolution war with the contiguous powers was inevitable sooner or later the evil must have been encountered and it was of little importance whether england took a share in it somewhat earlier than by fallible judgments might be deemed necessary or not <\s>
<s> the frankness with which the faults that were committed have been acknowledged entitles the writer to some regard when speaking from an intimate knowledge of the internal state of france at that time he affirms that the war waged against her was in a liberal interpretation of the words just and necessary <\s>
<s> at all events our nation viewed it in this light <\s>
<s> a large majority of the inhabitants of great britain called for the war and they who will the end will the means the war being deemed necessary taxes became indispensible for its support <\s>
<s> some might prefer one mode of raising them some another but these are minor considerations <\s>
<s> public men united in bodies must act on great principles <\s>
<s> mutual deference is a fundamental requisite for the composition and efficiency of a party for if individual judgment is to be obtruded and insisted upon in subordinate concerns the march of business will be perpetually obstructed <\s>
<s> the leaders will not know whom they can depend upon and therefore will be at a loss what to recommend and how to act <\s>
<s> if a public man differs from his party in essentials conscience and honour demand that he should withdraw but if there be no such difference it is incumbent upon him to submit his personal opinion to the general sense <\s>
<s> he therefore who thought the prosecution of the war necessary could not condemn the public imposts on this consequence the steady adherents of ministers rest their claim to approbation and advance it boldly in defiance of the outcry raised against the government on account of the burthens which the situation of europe compelled it to lay upon the people <\s>
<s> in matters of taste it is a process attended with little advantage and often injurious to compare one set of artists or writers with another <\s>

<s> till that time comes it will not grieve us that this county should supply two representatives to uphold the servants of the crown even if both should continue through unavoidable circumstances to issue from one family amongst us <\s>
<s> till that change takes place we will treat with scorn the senseless outcry for the recovery of an independence which has never been lost <\s>
<s> we are have been and will remain independent and the host of men respectable on every account who have publicly avowed their desire to maintain our present representatives in their seats deem it insolence to assert the contrary <\s>
<s> they are independent in every rational sense of the word acknowledging however that they rest upon a principle and are incorporated with an interest and this they regard as a proof that their affections are sane and their understandings superior to illusion <\s>
<s> but in certain vocabularies liberty is synonymous with licence and to be free as explained by some is to live and act without restraint <\s>
<s> in like manner independence according to the meaning of their interpretation is the explosive energy of conceit making blind havoc with expediency <\s>
<s> it is a presumptuous spirit at war with all the passive worth of mankind <\s>
<s> the independence which they boast of despises habit and time honoured forms of subordination it consists in breaking old ties upon new temptations in casting off the modest garb of private obligation to strut about in the glittering armour of public virtue in sacrificing with jacobinical infatuation the near to the remote and preferring to what has been known and tried that which has no distinct existence even in imagination in renouncing with voluble tongue and vain heart every thing intricate in motive and mixed in quality in a downright passion of love for absolute unapproachable patriotism <\s>
<s> in short the independence these reformers bawl for is the worthy precursor of the liberty they adore making her first essay by starting out of the course for the pleasure of falling into the ditch and asserting her heaven born vigour by soaring above the level of humanity in profession that it may more conspicuously appear how far she can fall below it in practice <\s>
<s> to this spurious independence the friends of our present representatives lay no claim <\s>
<s> they assert in the face of the world that those representatives hold their seats by free election that has placed them there and why should we wish to change what we do not disapprove of that which could not have been without our approbation <\s>

<s> brougham had not individually passed far beyond the line of that party if his conduct had been such that even they themselves would admit that he truly belonged to them the exception would still lie against the general rule and will remain till the character of men and measures materially changes for the better assuredly on the one side if not for the worse on the other <\s>
<s> remember what england might have been with an administration countenancing french doctrines at the dawn of the french revolution and suffering them as it advanced to be sown with every wind that came across the channel <\s>
<s> think what was the state of europe before the french emperor the apparent and in too many respects the real idol of opposition was overthrown <\s>
<s> numbers i am aware do not cease vehemently to maintain that the late war was neither just nor necessary that the ostensible and real causes of it were widely different that it was not begun and persisted in for the purpose of withstanding foreign aggression and in defence of social order but from unprincipled ambition in the powers of europe eager to seize that opportunity of augmenting their territories at the expence of distracted and enfeebled france events ever to be lamented do i grant give too much colour to those affirmations <\s>
<s> but this was a war upon a large scale wherein many belligerents took part and no one who distinctly remembers the state of europe at its commencement will be inclined any more to question that the alleged motives had a solid foundation because then or afterwards others might mix with them than he would doubt that the maintenance of christianity and the reduction of the power of the infidels were the principal motives of the crusades because roving adventurers joining in those expeditions turned them to their own profit <\s>
<s> traders and hypocrites may make part of a caravan bound to mecca but it does not follow that a religious observance is not the prime object of the pilgrimage <\s>
<s> the political fanaticism it deserves no milder name that pervaded the manifesto issued by the duke of brunswick on his entry into france proves that he and the power whose organ he was were swayed on their march by an ambition very different from that of territorial aggrandizement at least if such ambition existed it is plain that feelings of another kind blinded them to the means of gratifying it <\s>
<s> nevertheless we must acknowledge the passion soon manifested itself and in a quarter where it was least excusable <\s>
<s> the seizure of valenciennes in the name of the emperor of germany was an act of such glaring rapacity and gave the lie so unfeelingly to all that had been professed that the then ministers of great britain doubtless opposed the intention with a strong remonstrance <\s>
<s> but the dictates of magnanimity which in such cases is but another word for high and sage policy would have been 'this unjust act must either be abandoned or great britain shall retire from a contest which if such principles are to govern or interfere with the conduct of it cannot but be calamitous <\s>
<s> a threat to this purpose was either not given or not acted upon <\s>
<s> from that moment the alliance of the french loyalists with the coalesced powers seemed to have no ground of rational patriotism to stand upon <\s>
<s> their professed helpers became their worst enemies and numbers among them not only began to wish for the defeat of their false friends but joined themselves to their fellow countrymen of all parties who were labouring to effect it but the military successes of the french arising mainly from this want of principle in the confederate powers in course of time placed the policy and justice of the war upon a new footing <\s>
<s> however men might differ about the necessity or reasonableness of resorting to arms in the first instance things were brought to such a state that among the disinterested and dispassionate there could be but one opinion even if nothing higher than security was aimed at on the demand for the utmost strength of the nation being put forth in the prosecution of the war till it should assume a more hopeful aspect and now it was that ministers made ample amends for past subserviency to selfish coadjutors and proved themselves worthy of being entrusted with the fate of europe <\s>
<s> while the opposition were taking counsel from their fears and recommending despair while they continued to magnify without scruple the strength of the enemy and to expose misrepresent and therefore increase the weaknesses of their country his majesty's ministers were not daunted though often discouraged they struggled up against adversity with fortitude and persevered heroically throwing themselves upon the honour and wisdom of the country and trusting for the issue to the decrees of a just providence and for this determination everlasting gratitude will attend them <\s>
<s> from the internal situation of france produced by the revolution war with the contiguous powers was inevitable sooner or later the evil must have been encountered and it was of little importance whether england took a share in it somewhat earlier than by fallible judgments might be deemed necessary or not <\s>
<s> the frankness with which the faults that were committed have been acknowledged entitles the writer to some regard when speaking from an intimate knowledge of the internal state of france at that time he affirms that the war waged against her was in a liberal interpretation of the words just and necessary <\s>
<s> at all events our nation viewed it in this light <\s>
<s> a large majority of the inhabitants of great britain called for the war and they who will the end will the means the war being deemed necessary taxes became indispensible for its support <\s>
<s> some might prefer one mode of raising them some another but these are minor considerations <\s>
<s> public men united in bodies must act on great principles <\s>
<s> mutual deference is a fundamental requisite for the composition and efficiency of a party for if individual judgment is to be obtruded and insisted upon in subordinate concerns the march of business will be perpetually obstructed <\s>
<s> the leaders will not know whom they can depend upon and therefore will be at a loss what to recommend and how to act <\s>
<s> if a public man differs from his party in essentials conscience and honour demand that he should withdraw but if there be no such difference it is incumbent upon him to submit his personal opinion to the general sense <\s>
<s> he therefore who thought the prosecution of the war necessary could not condemn the public imposts on this consequence the steady adherents of ministers rest their claim to approbation and advance it boldly in defiance of the outcry raised against the government on account of the burthens which the situation of europe compelled it to lay upon the people <\s>
<s> in matters of taste it is a process attended with little advantage and often injurious to compare one set of artists or writers with another <\s>
<s> but in estimating the merits of public men especially of two parties acting in direct opposition it is not only expedient but indispensible that both should be kept constantly in sight <\s>
<s> the truth or fallacy of french principles and the tendency good or bad of the revolution which sprang out of them and the necessity or non necessity the policy or impolicy of resisting by war the encroachments of republican and imperial france these were the opposite grounds upon which each party staked their credit here we behold them in full contrast with each other to whom shall the crown be given <\s>
<s> on whom has the light fallen <\s>
<s> and who are covered by shade and thick darkness <\s>
<s> the magnanimity which resolved that for principle's sake no efforts should be spared to crush a bestial despotism was acknowledged by every manly spirit whom party degenerating into faction had not vitiated <\s>
<s> that such was the dictate of confiding wisdom had long been inwardly felt and the prudence of the course was evinced by the triumphant issue but to the very completeness of this triumph may be indirectly attributed no small portion of the obloquy how heaped upon those advisers through whom it was achieved <\s>
<s> the power of napoleon buonaparte was overthrown his person has disappeared from the theatre of europe his name has almost deserted the columns of her daily and weekly journals but as he has left no successor as there is no foreign tyrant of sufficient importance to attract hatred by exciting fear many honest english patriots must either find or set up something at home for the employment of those affections <\s>

<s> till that time comes it will not grieve us that this county should supply two representatives to uphold the servants of the crown even if both should continue through unavoidable circumstances to issue from one family amongst us <\s>
<s> till that change takes place we will treat with scorn the senseless outcry for the recovery of an independence which has never been lost <\s>
<s> we are have been and will remain independent and the host of men respectable on every account who have publicly avowed their desire to maintain our present representatives in their seats deem it insolence to assert the contrary <\s>
<s> they are independent in every rational sense of the word acknowledging however that they rest upon a principle and are incorporated with an interest and this they regard as a proof that their affections are sane and their understandings superior to illusion <\s>
<s> but in certain vocabularies liberty is synonymous with licence and to be free as explained by some is to live and act without restraint <\s>
<s> in like manner independence according to the meaning of their interpretation is the explosive energy of conceit making blind havoc with expediency <\s>
<s> it is a presumptuous spirit at war with all the passive worth of mankind <\s>
<s> the independence which they boast of despises habit and time honoured forms of subordination it consists in breaking old ties upon new temptations in casting off the modest garb of private obligation to strut about in the glittering armour of public virtue in sacrificing with jacobinical infatuation the near to the remote and preferring to what has been known and tried that which has no distinct existence even in imagination in renouncing with voluble tongue and vain heart every thing intricate in motive and mixed in quality in a downright passion of love for absolute unapproachable patriotism <\s>
<s> in short the independence these reformers bawl for is the worthy precursor of the liberty they adore making her first essay by starting out of the course for the pleasure of falling into the ditch and asserting her heaven born vigour by soaring above the level of humanity in profession that it may more conspicuously appear how far she can fall below it in practice <\s>
<s> to this spurious independence the friends of our present representatives lay no claim <\s>
<s> they assert in the face of the world that those representatives hold their seats by free election that has placed them there and why should we wish to change what we do not disapprove of that which could not have been without our approbation <\s>

<s> gentlemen much of my former address originated in deference to that sense of right which is inseparable from the minds of enlightened patriots <\s>
<s> passing from local considerations i wrote under a belief that whatever personal or family leanings might prevail among you you would be moved by a wish to see the supporters of his majesty's ministers and their opponents possessed relatively to each other of that degree of strength which might render both parties in their several capacities most serviceable to the state <\s>
<s> i noticed that this just proportion of strength no longer remained and shewed that the opposition had caused it to be destroyed by holding from the beginning of the french revolution such a course as introduced in parliament discord among themselves deprived them in that house and elsewhere of the respect which from their adversaries they had been accustomed to command turned indifferent persons into enemies and alienated throughout the island the affections of thousands who had been proud to unite with them <\s>
<s> this weakness and degradation deplored by all true friends of the commonweal was sufficiently accounted for without even adverting to the fact that when the disasters of the war had induced the country to forgive and in some degree to forget the alarming attachment of that party to french theories and power heightened by the popularity of hope and expectation was thrown into their hands they disgusted even bigotted adherents by the rapacious use they made of that power stooping to so many offensive compromises and committing so many faults in every department that a government of talents if such be the fruits of talent was proved to be the most mischievous sort of government which england had ever been troubled with <\s>

<s> remember what england might have been with an administration countenancing french doctrines at the dawn of the french revolution and suffering them as it advanced to be sown with every wind that came across the channel <\s>
<s> think what was the state of europe before the french emperor the apparent and in too many respects the real idol of opposition was overthrown <\s>
<s> numbers i am aware do not cease vehemently to maintain that the late war was neither just nor necessary that the ostensible and real causes of it were widely different that it was not begun and persisted in for the purpose of withstanding foreign aggression and in defence of social order but from unprincipled ambition in the powers of europe eager to seize that opportunity of augmenting their territories at the expence of distracted and enfeebled france events ever to be lamented do i grant give too much colour to those affirmations <\s>
<s> but this was a war upon a large scale wherein many belligerents took part and no one who distinctly remembers the state of europe at its commencement will be inclined any more to question that the alleged motives had a solid foundation because then or afterwards others might mix with them than he would doubt that the maintenance of christianity and the reduction of the power of the infidels were the principal motives of the crusades because roving adventurers joining in those expeditions turned them to their own profit <\s>
<s> traders and hypocrites may make part of a caravan bound to mecca but it does not follow that a religious observance is not the prime object of the pilgrimage <\s>
<s> the political fanaticism it deserves no milder name that pervaded the manifesto issued by the duke of brunswick on his entry into france proves that he and the power whose organ he was were swayed on their march by an ambition very different from that of territorial aggrandizement at least if such ambition existed it is plain that feelings of another kind blinded them to the means of gratifying it <\s>
<s> nevertheless we must acknowledge the passion soon manifested itself and in a quarter where it was least excusable <\s>
<s> the seizure of valenciennes in the name of the emperor of germany was an act of such glaring rapacity and gave the lie so unfeelingly to all that had been professed that the then ministers of great britain doubtless opposed the intention with a strong remonstrance <\s>
<s> but the dictates of magnanimity which in such cases is but another word for high and sage policy would have been 'this unjust act must either be abandoned or great britain shall retire from a contest which if such principles are to govern or interfere with the conduct of it cannot but be calamitous <\s>
<s> a threat to this purpose was either not given or not acted upon <\s>
<s> from that moment the alliance of the french loyalists with the coalesced powers seemed to have no ground of rational patriotism to stand upon <\s>
<s> their professed helpers became their worst enemies and numbers among them not only began to wish for the defeat of their false friends but joined themselves to their fellow countrymen of all parties who were labouring to effect it but the military successes of the french arising mainly from this want of principle in the confederate powers in course of time placed the policy and justice of the war upon a new footing <\s>
<s> however men might differ about the necessity or reasonableness of resorting to arms in the first instance things were brought to such a state that among the disinterested and dispassionate there could be but one opinion even if nothing higher than security was aimed at on the demand for the utmost strength of the nation being put forth in the prosecution of the war till it should assume a more hopeful aspect and now it was that ministers made ample amends for past subserviency to selfish coadjutors and proved themselves worthy of being entrusted with the fate of europe <\s>
<s> while the opposition were taking counsel from their fears and recommending despair while they continued to magnify without scruple the strength of the enemy and to expose misrepresent and therefore increase the weaknesses of their country his majesty's ministers were not daunted though often discouraged they struggled up against adversity with fortitude and persevered heroically throwing themselves upon the honour and wisdom of the country and trusting for the issue to the decrees of a just providence and for this determination everlasting gratitude will attend them <\s>
<s> from the internal situation of france produced by the revolution war with the contiguous powers was inevitable sooner or later the evil must have been encountered and it was of little importance whether england took a share in it somewhat earlier than by fallible judgments might be deemed necessary or not <\s>
<s> the frankness with which the faults that were committed have been acknowledged entitles the writer to some regard when speaking from an intimate knowledge of the internal state of france at that time he affirms that the war waged against her was in a liberal interpretation of the words just and necessary <\s>
<s> at all events our nation viewed it in this light <\s>
<s> a large majority of the inhabitants of great britain called for the war and they who will the end will the means the war being deemed necessary taxes became indispensible for its support <\s>
<s> some might prefer one mode of raising them some another but these are minor considerations <\s>
<s> public men united in bodies must act on great principles <\s>
<s> mutual deference is a fundamental requisite for the composition and efficiency of a party for if individual judgment is to be obtruded and insisted upon in subordinate concerns the march of business will be perpetually obstructed <\s>
<s> the leaders will not know whom they can depend upon and therefore will be at a loss what to recommend and how to act <\s>
<s> if a public man differs from his party in essentials conscience and honour demand that he should withdraw but if there be no such difference it is incumbent upon him to submit his personal opinion to the general sense <\s>
<s> he therefore who thought the prosecution of the war necessary could not condemn the public imposts on this consequence the steady adherents of ministers rest their claim to approbation and advance it boldly in defiance of the outcry raised against the government on account of the burthens which the situation of europe compelled it to lay upon the people <\s>
<s> in matters of taste it is a process attended with little advantage and often injurious to compare one set of artists or writers with another <\s>
<s> but in estimating the merits of public men especially of two parties acting in direct opposition it is not only expedient but indispensible that both should be kept constantly in sight <\s>
<s> the truth or fallacy of french principles and the tendency good or bad of the revolution which sprang out of them and the necessity or non necessity the policy or impolicy of resisting by war the encroachments of republican and imperial france these were the opposite grounds upon which each party staked their credit here we behold them in full contrast with each other to whom shall the crown be given <\s>
<s> on whom has the light fallen <\s>
<s> and who are covered by shade and thick darkness <\s>
<s> the magnanimity which resolved that for principle's sake no efforts should be spared to crush a bestial despotism was acknowledged by every manly spirit whom party degenerating into faction had not vitiated <\s>
<s> that such was the dictate of confiding wisdom had long been inwardly felt and the prudence of the course was evinced by the triumphant issue but to the very completeness of this triumph may be indirectly attributed no small portion of the obloquy how heaped upon those advisers through whom it was achieved <\s>
<s> the power of napoleon buonaparte was overthrown his person has disappeared from the theatre of europe his name has almost deserted the columns of her daily and weekly journals but as he has left no successor as there is no foreign tyrant of sufficient importance to attract hatred by exciting fear many honest english patriots must either find or set up something at home for the employment of those affections <\s>
<s> this is too natural to occasion surprise thousands are so framed that they are but languidly conscious of their love of an object unless while they feel themselves in an active state of aversion to something which they can regard as its opposite thus we see men who had been proud of their attachment to his majesty's ministers during the awful struggle as soon as it was over allowing on the first temptation that proud attachment to be converted into immoderate suspicion and a long experienced gratitude into sudden alienation through this infirmity many were betrayed into taking part with the men whom they had heretofore despised or condemned and assisted them in reviling their own government for suffering among the states of the continent institutions to remain which the respective nations surely the best if not the only judges in the case were unwilling to part with and for having permitted things to be done either just and proper in themselves or if indeed abuses abuses of that kind which great britain had neither right to oppose nor power to prevent <\s>
<s> not a frenchman is in arms in spain <\s>
<s> but alas for the credit of the english cabinet ferdinand though a lawful appears to be a sorry king and the inquisition though venerated by the people of spain as a holy tribunal which has spread a protecting shade over their religion for hundreds of years is among protestants an abomination <\s>

<s> if it be praiseworthy to have contributed to cast shoals of our deserving countrymen adrift without regard to their past services that praise cannot be denied him if it be commendable to have availed himself of inordinate momentary passion to carry measures whereby the general weal was sacrificed whether designedly for the attainment of popularity or in the self applauding sincerity of a heated mind that praise is due to mr <\s>
<s> brougham and his coadjutors <\s>
<s> but to the judicious freeholders of westmoreland whether gentry or yeomanry rich or poor he will in vain adduce this or any other part of the recent conduct of opposition as a motive for strengthening their interests amongst us <\s>
<s> no freeholders we must wait assuring them that they shall have a reasonable portion of our support as soon as they have proved that they deserve it <\s>
<s> till that time comes it will not grieve us that this county should supply two representatives to uphold the servants of the crown even if both should continue through unavoidable circumstances to issue from one family amongst us <\s>
<s> till that change takes place we will treat with scorn the senseless outcry for the recovery of an independence which has never been lost <\s>
<s> we are have been and will remain independent and the host of men respectable on every account who have publicly avowed their desire to maintain our present representatives in their seats deem it insolence to assert the contrary <\s>
<s> they are independent in every rational sense of the word acknowledging however that they rest upon a principle and are incorporated with an interest and this they regard as a proof that their affections are sane and their understandings superior to illusion <\s>
<s> but in certain vocabularies liberty is synonymous with licence and to be free as explained by some is to live and act without restraint <\s>
<s> in like manner independence according to the meaning of their interpretation is the explosive energy of conceit making blind havoc with expediency <\s>
<s> it is a presumptuous spirit at war with all the passive worth of mankind <\s>
<s> the independence which they boast of despises habit and time honoured forms of subordination it consists in breaking old ties upon new temptations in casting off the modest garb of private obligation to strut about in the glittering armour of public virtue in sacrificing with jacobinical infatuation the near to the remote and preferring to what has been known and tried that which has no distinct existence even in imagination in renouncing with voluble tongue and vain heart every thing intricate in motive and mixed in quality in a downright passion of love for absolute unapproachable patriotism <\s>
<s> in short the independence these reformers bawl for is the worthy precursor of the liberty they adore making her first essay by starting out of the course for the pleasure of falling into the ditch and asserting her heaven born vigour by soaring above the level of humanity in profession that it may more conspicuously appear how far she can fall below it in practice <\s>
<s> to this spurious independence the friends of our present representatives lay no claim <\s>
<s> they assert in the face of the world that those representatives hold their seats by free election that has placed them there and why should we wish to change what we do not disapprove of that which could not have been without our approbation <\s>
<s> but this county has not for a long time been disturbed by electioneering contests is there no species of choice then but that which is accompanied with commotion and clamour <\s>
<s> do silent acquiescence and deliberate consent pass for nothing <\s>
<s> being contented what could we seek for more <\s>
<s> being satisfied why should we stir for stirring's sake <\s>
<s> uproar and disorder even these we could tolerate on a justifying occasion but it is no sign of prudence to court them unnecessarily nor of temper to invite them wantonly <\s>
<s> he who resorts to substantial unruliness for the redress of imaginary grievances provokes certain mischief and often in the end produces calamity which would excite little compassion could it be confined to its original author <\s>
<s> let those who think that they are degraded proclaim their own dishonour <\s>
<s> gentlemen much of my former address originated in deference to that sense of right which is inseparable from the minds of enlightened patriots <\s>
<s> passing from local considerations i wrote under a belief that whatever personal or family leanings might prevail among you you would be moved by a wish to see the supporters of his majesty's ministers and their opponents possessed relatively to each other of that degree of strength which might render both parties in their several capacities most serviceable to the state <\s>
<s> i noticed that this just proportion of strength no longer remained and shewed that the opposition had caused it to be destroyed by holding from the beginning of the french revolution such a course as introduced in parliament discord among themselves deprived them in that house and elsewhere of the respect which from their adversaries they had been accustomed to command turned indifferent persons into enemies and alienated throughout the island the affections of thousands who had been proud to unite with them <\s>
<s> this weakness and degradation deplored by all true friends of the commonweal was sufficiently accounted for without even adverting to the fact that when the disasters of the war had induced the country to forgive and in some degree to forget the alarming attachment of that party to french theories and power heightened by the popularity of hope and expectation was thrown into their hands they disgusted even bigotted adherents by the rapacious use they made of that power stooping to so many offensive compromises and committing so many faults in every department that a government of talents if such be the fruits of talent was proved to be the most mischievous sort of government which england had ever been troubled with <\s>
<s> so that whether in or out of place an evil genius seemed to attend them <\s>
<s> how could all this happen <\s>
<s> for the fundamental reason that neither the religion the laws the morals the manners nor the literature of the country especially as contrasted with those of france were prized by the leaders of the party as they deserved <\s>
<s> it is a notorious fact that among their personal friends was scarcely to be found a single clergyman of distinction so that how to dispose of their ecclesiastical patronage in a manner that might do them credit they were almost as ignorant as strangers landed for the first time in a foreign country <\s>
<s> this is not to be accounted for on any supposition since the education of men of rank naturally devolves on those members of our universities who choose the church for their profession but that of a repugnance on their part to associate with persons of grave character and decorous manners <\s>
<s> is the distracted remnant of the party now surviving improved in that respect <\s>
<s> the dazzling talents with which it was once distinguished have passed away pleasure and dissipation are no longer in that quarter exhibited to the world in such reconcilement with business as excited dispositions to forgive what could not be approved and a species of wonder not sufficiently kept apart from envy at the extraordinary gifts and powers by which the union was accomplished <\s>
<s> this injurious conjunction no longer exists so as to attract the eyes of the nation <\s>
<s> but we look in vain for signs that the opinions habits and feelings of the party are tending towards a restoration of that genuine english character by which alone the confidence of the sound part of the people can be recovered <\s>
<s> the public life of the candidate who now for the first time solicits your suffrages my brother freeholders cannot however without injustice to that party be deemed a fair exponent of its political opinions <\s>

<s> remember what england might have been with an administration countenancing french doctrines at the dawn of the french revolution and suffering them as it advanced to be sown with every wind that came across the channel <\s>
<s> think what was the state of europe before the french emperor the apparent and in too many respects the real idol of opposition was overthrown <\s>
<s> numbers i am aware do not cease vehemently to maintain that the late war was neither just nor necessary that the ostensible and real causes of it were widely different that it was not begun and persisted in for the purpose of withstanding foreign aggression and in defence of social order but from unprincipled ambition in the powers of europe eager to seize that opportunity of augmenting their territories at the expence of distracted and enfeebled france events ever to be lamented do i grant give too much colour to those affirmations <\s>
<s> but this was a war upon a large scale wherein many belligerents took part and no one who distinctly remembers the state of europe at its commencement will be inclined any more to question that the alleged motives had a solid foundation because then or afterwards others might mix with them than he would doubt that the maintenance of christianity and the reduction of the power of the infidels were the principal motives of the crusades because roving adventurers joining in those expeditions turned them to their own profit <\s>
<s> traders and hypocrites may make part of a caravan bound to mecca but it does not follow that a religious observance is not the prime object of the pilgrimage <\s>
<s> the political fanaticism it deserves no milder name that pervaded the manifesto issued by the duke of brunswick on his entry into france proves that he and the power whose organ he was were swayed on their march by an ambition very different from that of territorial aggrandizement at least if such ambition existed it is plain that feelings of another kind blinded them to the means of gratifying it <\s>
<s> nevertheless we must acknowledge the passion soon manifested itself and in a quarter where it was least excusable <\s>
<s> the seizure of valenciennes in the name of the emperor of germany was an act of such glaring rapacity and gave the lie so unfeelingly to all that had been professed that the then ministers of great britain doubtless opposed the intention with a strong remonstrance <\s>
<s> but the dictates of magnanimity which in such cases is but another word for high and sage policy would have been 'this unjust act must either be abandoned or great britain shall retire from a contest which if such principles are to govern or interfere with the conduct of it cannot but be calamitous <\s>
<s> a threat to this purpose was either not given or not acted upon <\s>
<s> from that moment the alliance of the french loyalists with the coalesced powers seemed to have no ground of rational patriotism to stand upon <\s>
<s> their professed helpers became their worst enemies and numbers among them not only began to wish for the defeat of their false friends but joined themselves to their fellow countrymen of all parties who were labouring to effect it but the military successes of the french arising mainly from this want of principle in the confederate powers in course of time placed the policy and justice of the war upon a new footing <\s>
<s> however men might differ about the necessity or reasonableness of resorting to arms in the first instance things were brought to such a state that among the disinterested and dispassionate there could be but one opinion even if nothing higher than security was aimed at on the demand for the utmost strength of the nation being put forth in the prosecution of the war till it should assume a more hopeful aspect and now it was that ministers made ample amends for past subserviency to selfish coadjutors and proved themselves worthy of being entrusted with the fate of europe <\s>
<s> while the opposition were taking counsel from their fears and recommending despair while they continued to magnify without scruple the strength of the enemy and to expose misrepresent and therefore increase the weaknesses of their country his majesty's ministers were not daunted though often discouraged they struggled up against adversity with fortitude and persevered heroically throwing themselves upon the honour and wisdom of the country and trusting for the issue to the decrees of a just providence and for this determination everlasting gratitude will attend them <\s>
<s> from the internal situation of france produced by the revolution war with the contiguous powers was inevitable sooner or later the evil must have been encountered and it was of little importance whether england took a share in it somewhat earlier than by fallible judgments might be deemed necessary or not <\s>
<s> the frankness with which the faults that were committed have been acknowledged entitles the writer to some regard when speaking from an intimate knowledge of the internal state of france at that time he affirms that the war waged against her was in a liberal interpretation of the words just and necessary <\s>
<s> at all events our nation viewed it in this light <\s>
<s> a large majority of the inhabitants of great britain called for the war and they who will the end will the means the war being deemed necessary taxes became indispensible for its support <\s>
<s> some might prefer one mode of raising them some another but these are minor considerations <\s>
<s> public men united in bodies must act on great principles <\s>
<s> mutual deference is a fundamental requisite for the composition and efficiency of a party for if individual judgment is to be obtruded and insisted upon in subordinate concerns the march of business will be perpetually obstructed <\s>
<s> the leaders will not know whom they can depend upon and therefore will be at a loss what to recommend and how to act <\s>
<s> if a public man differs from his party in essentials conscience and honour demand that he should withdraw but if there be no such difference it is incumbent upon him to submit his personal opinion to the general sense <\s>
<s> he therefore who thought the prosecution of the war necessary could not condemn the public imposts on this consequence the steady adherents of ministers rest their claim to approbation and advance it boldly in defiance of the outcry raised against the government on account of the burthens which the situation of europe compelled it to lay upon the people <\s>
<s> in matters of taste it is a process attended with little advantage and often injurious to compare one set of artists or writers with another <\s>
<s> but in estimating the merits of public men especially of two parties acting in direct opposition it is not only expedient but indispensible that both should be kept constantly in sight <\s>
<s> the truth or fallacy of french principles and the tendency good or bad of the revolution which sprang out of them and the necessity or non necessity the policy or impolicy of resisting by war the encroachments of republican and imperial france these were the opposite grounds upon which each party staked their credit here we behold them in full contrast with each other to whom shall the crown be given <\s>
<s> on whom has the light fallen <\s>
<s> and who are covered by shade and thick darkness <\s>
<s> the magnanimity which resolved that for principle's sake no efforts should be spared to crush a bestial despotism was acknowledged by every manly spirit whom party degenerating into faction had not vitiated <\s>
<s> that such was the dictate of confiding wisdom had long been inwardly felt and the prudence of the course was evinced by the triumphant issue but to the very completeness of this triumph may be indirectly attributed no small portion of the obloquy how heaped upon those advisers through whom it was achieved <\s>
<s> the power of napoleon buonaparte was overthrown his person has disappeared from the theatre of europe his name has almost deserted the columns of her daily and weekly journals but as he has left no successor as there is no foreign tyrant of sufficient importance to attract hatred by exciting fear many honest english patriots must either find or set up something at home for the employment of those affections <\s>
<s> this is too natural to occasion surprise thousands are so framed that they are but languidly conscious of their love of an object unless while they feel themselves in an active state of aversion to something which they can regard as its opposite thus we see men who had been proud of their attachment to his majesty's ministers during the awful struggle as soon as it was over allowing on the first temptation that proud attachment to be converted into immoderate suspicion and a long experienced gratitude into sudden alienation through this infirmity many were betrayed into taking part with the men whom they had heretofore despised or condemned and assisted them in reviling their own government for suffering among the states of the continent institutions to remain which the respective nations surely the best if not the only judges in the case were unwilling to part with and for having permitted things to be done either just and proper in themselves or if indeed abuses abuses of that kind which great britain had neither right to oppose nor power to prevent <\s>
<s> not a frenchman is in arms in spain <\s>
<s> but alas for the credit of the english cabinet ferdinand though a lawful appears to be a sorry king and the inquisition though venerated by the people of spain as a holy tribunal which has spread a protecting shade over their religion for hundreds of years is among protestants an abomination <\s>
<s> is that however a reason why we should not rejoice that spain is restored to the rank of an independent nation and that her resources do not continue at the disposal of a foreign tyrant for the annoyance of great britain <\s>
<s> prussia no longer receives decrees from the tuilleries but nothing we are told is gained by this deliverance because the sovereign of that country has not participated as far as became him a popular effervescence and has withheld from his subjects certain privileges which they have proved themselves to all but heated judgments not yet qualified to receive <\s>
<s> now if numbers can blame without cause the british cabinet for events falling below their wishes in cases remote from their immediate concerns the reasonableness of their opinions may well be questioned in points where selfish passion is touched to the quick yes in spite of the outcry of such men to the contrary every enlightened politician and discerning patriot however diffident as to what was the exact line of prudence in such arduous circumstances will reprobate the conduct of those who were for reducing public expenditure with a precipitation that might have produced a convulsion in the state <\s>
<s> the habeas corpus act is also our own near concern it was suspended some think without sufficient cause not so however the persons who had the best means of ascertaining the state of the country for they could have been induced to have recourse to a measure at all times so obnoxious by nothing less than a persuasion of its expediency <\s>
<s> but persuasion an objector will say is produced in many ways and even that degree of it which in these matters passes for conviction depends less upon external testimony than on the habits and feelings of those by whom the testimony is to be weighed and decided upon <\s>
<s> a council for the administration of affairs is far from being as favourably circumstanced as a tribunal of law for the party which is to pronounce upon the case has had to procure the evidence the sum and quality of which must needs have been affected by previously existing prejudices and by any bias received in the process of collecting it the privileges of the subject one might think would never be unjustifiably infringed if it were only from considerations of self interest but power is apt to resort to unnecessary rigour in order to supply the deficiencies of authority forfeited by remissness it is also not unfrequently exerted merely to shew that it is possessed to shew this to others while power is a novelty and when it has long ceased to be so to prove it to ourselves <\s>

<s> brougham and his coadjutors <\s>
<s> but to the judicious freeholders of westmoreland whether gentry or yeomanry rich or poor he will in vain adduce this or any other part of the recent conduct of opposition as a motive for strengthening their interests amongst us <\s>
<s> no freeholders we must wait assuring them that they shall have a reasonable portion of our support as soon as they have proved that they deserve it <\s>
<s> till that time comes it will not grieve us that this county should supply two representatives to uphold the servants of the crown even if both should continue through unavoidable circumstances to issue from one family amongst us <\s>
<s> till that change takes place we will treat with scorn the senseless outcry for the recovery of an independence which has never been lost <\s>
<s> we are have been and will remain independent and the host of men respectable on every account who have publicly avowed their desire to maintain our present representatives in their seats deem it insolence to assert the contrary <\s>
<s> they are independent in every rational sense of the word acknowledging however that they rest upon a principle and are incorporated with an interest and this they regard as a proof that their affections are sane and their understandings superior to illusion <\s>
<s> but in certain vocabularies liberty is synonymous with licence and to be free as explained by some is to live and act without restraint <\s>
<s> in like manner independence according to the meaning of their interpretation is the explosive energy of conceit making blind havoc with expediency <\s>
<s> it is a presumptuous spirit at war with all the passive worth of mankind <\s>
<s> the independence which they boast of despises habit and time honoured forms of subordination it consists in breaking old ties upon new temptations in casting off the modest garb of private obligation to strut about in the glittering armour of public virtue in sacrificing with jacobinical infatuation the near to the remote and preferring to what has been known and tried that which has no distinct existence even in imagination in renouncing with voluble tongue and vain heart every thing intricate in motive and mixed in quality in a downright passion of love for absolute unapproachable patriotism <\s>
<s> in short the independence these reformers bawl for is the worthy precursor of the liberty they adore making her first essay by starting out of the course for the pleasure of falling into the ditch and asserting her heaven born vigour by soaring above the level of humanity in profession that it may more conspicuously appear how far she can fall below it in practice <\s>
<s> to this spurious independence the friends of our present representatives lay no claim <\s>
<s> they assert in the face of the world that those representatives hold their seats by free election that has placed them there and why should we wish to change what we do not disapprove of that which could not have been without our approbation <\s>

<s> gentlemen much of my former address originated in deference to that sense of right which is inseparable from the minds of enlightened patriots <\s>
<s> passing from local considerations i wrote under a belief that whatever personal or family leanings might prevail among you you would be moved by a wish to see the supporters of his majesty's ministers and their opponents possessed relatively to each other of that degree of strength which might render both parties in their several capacities most serviceable to the state <\s>
<s> i noticed that this just proportion of strength no longer remained and shewed that the opposition had caused it to be destroyed by holding from the beginning of the french revolution such a course as introduced in parliament discord among themselves deprived them in that house and elsewhere of the respect which from their adversaries they had been accustomed to command turned indifferent persons into enemies and alienated throughout the island the affections of thousands who had been proud to unite with them <\s>
<s> this weakness and degradation deplored by all true friends of the commonweal was sufficiently accounted for without even adverting to the fact that when the disasters of the war had induced the country to forgive and in some degree to forget the alarming attachment of that party to french theories and power heightened by the popularity of hope and expectation was thrown into their hands they disgusted even bigotted adherents by the rapacious use they made of that power stooping to so many offensive compromises and committing so many faults in every department that a government of talents if such be the fruits of talent was proved to be the most mischievous sort of government which england had ever been troubled with <\s>
<s> so that whether in or out of place an evil genius seemed to attend them <\s>
<s> how could all this happen <\s>
<s> for the fundamental reason that neither the religion the laws the morals the manners nor the literature of the country especially as contrasted with those of france were prized by the leaders of the party as they deserved <\s>
<s> it is a notorious fact that among their personal friends was scarcely to be found a single clergyman of distinction so that how to dispose of their ecclesiastical patronage in a manner that might do them credit they were almost as ignorant as strangers landed for the first time in a foreign country <\s>
<s> this is not to be accounted for on any supposition since the education of men of rank naturally devolves on those members of our universities who choose the church for their profession but that of a repugnance on their part to associate with persons of grave character and decorous manners <\s>
<s> is the distracted remnant of the party now surviving improved in that respect <\s>
<s> the dazzling talents with which it was once distinguished have passed away pleasure and dissipation are no longer in that quarter exhibited to the world in such reconcilement with business as excited dispositions to forgive what could not be approved and a species of wonder not sufficiently kept apart from envy at the extraordinary gifts and powers by which the union was accomplished <\s>
<s> this injurious conjunction no longer exists so as to attract the eyes of the nation <\s>
<s> but we look in vain for signs that the opinions habits and feelings of the party are tending towards a restoration of that genuine english character by which alone the confidence of the sound part of the people can be recovered <\s>
<s> the public life of the candidate who now for the first time solicits your suffrages my brother freeholders cannot however without injustice to that party be deemed a fair exponent of its political opinions <\s>
<s> it has indeed been too tolerant with mr <\s>
<s> brougham while he was labouring to ingraft certain sour cuttings from the wild wood of ultra reform on the reverend though somewhat decayed stock of that tree of whiggism which flourished proudly under the cultivation of our ancestors <\s>
<s> this indulgence and others like it will embolden him to aim at passing himself off as the delegate of opposition and the authorized pleader of their cause <\s>
<s> but time that judge from whom none but triflers appeal to conjecture has decided upon leading principles and main events and given the verdict against his clients <\s>
<s> while with a ready tongue the advocate of a disappointed party is filling one scale do you with a clear memory and apt judgment silently throw in what of right belongs to the other and the result will be that no sensible man among you who has supported the present members on account of their steady adherence to ministers can be induced to change his conduct or be persuaded that the hour is either come or approaching when for the sake of bringing the power of opposition in this county nearer to an equality with that of ministers it will be his duty to vote against those representatives in whom he has hitherto confided <\s>
<s> brougham had not individually passed far beyond the line of that party if his conduct had been such that even they themselves would admit that he truly belonged to them the exception would still lie against the general rule and will remain till the character of men and measures materially changes for the better assuredly on the one side if not for the worse on the other <\s>

<s> however men might differ about the necessity or reasonableness of resorting to arms in the first instance things were brought to such a state that among the disinterested and dispassionate there could be but one opinion even if nothing higher than security was aimed at on the demand for the utmost strength of the nation being put forth in the prosecution of the war till it should assume a more hopeful aspect and now it was that ministers made ample amends for past subserviency to selfish coadjutors and proved themselves worthy of being entrusted with the fate of europe <\s>
<s> while the opposition were taking counsel from their fears and recommending despair while they continued to magnify without scruple the strength of the enemy and to expose misrepresent and therefore increase the weaknesses of their country his majesty's ministers were not daunted though often discouraged they struggled up against adversity with fortitude and persevered heroically throwing themselves upon the honour and wisdom of the country and trusting for the issue to the decrees of a just providence and for this determination everlasting gratitude will attend them <\s>

<s> in matters of taste it is a process attended with little advantage and often injurious to compare one set of artists or writers with another <\s>

<s> the truth or fallacy of french principles and the tendency good or bad of the revolution which sprang out of them and the necessity or non necessity the policy or impolicy of resisting by war the encroachments of republican and imperial france these were the opposite grounds upon which each party staked their credit here we behold them in full contrast with each other to whom shall the crown be given <\s>

<s> this is too natural to occasion surprise thousands are so framed that they are but languidly conscious of their love of an object unless while they feel themselves in an active state of aversion to something which they can regard as its opposite thus we see men who had been proud of their attachment to his majesty's ministers during the awful struggle as soon as it was over allowing on the first temptation that proud attachment to be converted into immoderate suspicion and a long experienced gratitude into sudden alienation through this infirmity many were betrayed into taking part with the men whom they had heretofore despised or condemned and assisted them in reviling their own government for suffering among the states of the continent institutions to remain which the respective nations surely the best if not the only judges in the case were unwilling to part with and for having permitted things to be done either just and proper in themselves or if indeed abuses abuses of that kind which great britain had neither right to oppose nor power to prevent <\s>

<s> now if numbers can blame without cause the british cabinet for events falling below their wishes in cases remote from their immediate concerns the reasonableness of their opinions may well be questioned in points where selfish passion is touched to the quick yes in spite of the outcry of such men to the contrary every enlightened politician and discerning patriot however diffident as to what was the exact line of prudence in such arduous circumstances will reprobate the conduct of those who were for reducing public expenditure with a precipitation that might have produced a convulsion in the state <\s>
<s> the habeas corpus act is also our own near concern it was suspended some think without sufficient cause not so however the persons who had the best means of ascertaining the state of the country for they could have been induced to have recourse to a measure at all times so obnoxious by nothing less than a persuasion of its expediency <\s>

<s> happily for the inhabitants of westmoreland as no dispositions existing among them could furnish a motive for this restrictive measure so they will not be sorry that their remoteness from scenes of public confusion has placed them where they will be slow to give an unqualified opinion upon its merits <\s>
<s> yet it will not escape their discernment that if doubts might have been entertained whether the ignorant and distressed multitude in other parts of the island were actually brought to a state that justified the suspension of this law such doubts must have been weakened if not wholly removed by the subsequent behaviour of those in the upper ranks of society who in order to arraign the government and denounce the laws have seized every opportunity of palliating sedition if not of exculpating treason <\s>

<s> till that time comes it will not grieve us that this county should supply two representatives to uphold the servants of the crown even if both should continue through unavoidable circumstances to issue from one family amongst us <\s>
<s> till that change takes place we will treat with scorn the senseless outcry for the recovery of an independence which has never been lost <\s>
<s> we are have been and will remain independent and the host of men respectable on every account who have publicly avowed their desire to maintain our present representatives in their seats deem it insolence to assert the contrary <\s>
<s> they are independent in every rational sense of the word acknowledging however that they rest upon a principle and are incorporated with an interest and this they regard as a proof that their affections are sane and their understandings superior to illusion <\s>
<s> but in certain vocabularies liberty is synonymous with licence and to be free as explained by some is to live and act without restraint <\s>
<s> in like manner independence according to the meaning of their interpretation is the explosive energy of conceit making blind havoc with expediency <\s>
<s> it is a presumptuous spirit at war with all the passive worth of mankind <\s>
<s> the independence which they boast of despises habit and time honoured forms of subordination it consists in breaking old ties upon new temptations in casting off the modest garb of private obligation to strut about in the glittering armour of public virtue in sacrificing with jacobinical infatuation the near to the remote and preferring to what has been known and tried that which has no distinct existence even in imagination in renouncing with voluble tongue and vain heart every thing intricate in motive and mixed in quality in a downright passion of love for absolute unapproachable patriotism <\s>
<s> in short the independence these reformers bawl for is the worthy precursor of the liberty they adore making her first essay by starting out of the course for the pleasure of falling into the ditch and asserting her heaven born vigour by soaring above the level of humanity in profession that it may more conspicuously appear how far she can fall below it in practice <\s>
<s> to this spurious independence the friends of our present representatives lay no claim <\s>
<s> they assert in the face of the world that those representatives hold their seats by free election that has placed them there and why should we wish to change what we do not disapprove of that which could not have been without our approbation <\s>

<s> let those who think that they are degraded proclaim their own dishonour <\s>
<s> gentlemen much of my former address originated in deference to that sense of right which is inseparable from the minds of enlightened patriots <\s>
<s> passing from local considerations i wrote under a belief that whatever personal or family leanings might prevail among you you would be moved by a wish to see the supporters of his majesty's ministers and their opponents possessed relatively to each other of that degree of strength which might render both parties in their several capacities most serviceable to the state <\s>
<s> i noticed that this just proportion of strength no longer remained and shewed that the opposition had caused it to be destroyed by holding from the beginning of the french revolution such a course as introduced in parliament discord among themselves deprived them in that house and elsewhere of the respect which from their adversaries they had been accustomed to command turned indifferent persons into enemies and alienated throughout the island the affections of thousands who had been proud to unite with them <\s>
<s> this weakness and degradation deplored by all true friends of the commonweal was sufficiently accounted for without even adverting to the fact that when the disasters of the war had induced the country to forgive and in some degree to forget the alarming attachment of that party to french theories and power heightened by the popularity of hope and expectation was thrown into their hands they disgusted even bigotted adherents by the rapacious use they made of that power stooping to so many offensive compromises and committing so many faults in every department that a government of talents if such be the fruits of talent was proved to be the most mischievous sort of government which england had ever been troubled with <\s>
<s> so that whether in or out of place an evil genius seemed to attend them <\s>
<s> how could all this happen <\s>
<s> for the fundamental reason that neither the religion the laws the morals the manners nor the literature of the country especially as contrasted with those of france were prized by the leaders of the party as they deserved <\s>
<s> it is a notorious fact that among their personal friends was scarcely to be found a single clergyman of distinction so that how to dispose of their ecclesiastical patronage in a manner that might do them credit they were almost as ignorant as strangers landed for the first time in a foreign country <\s>
<s> this is not to be accounted for on any supposition since the education of men of rank naturally devolves on those members of our universities who choose the church for their profession but that of a repugnance on their part to associate with persons of grave character and decorous manners <\s>
<s> is the distracted remnant of the party now surviving improved in that respect <\s>
<s> the dazzling talents with which it was once distinguished have passed away pleasure and dissipation are no longer in that quarter exhibited to the world in such reconcilement with business as excited dispositions to forgive what could not be approved and a species of wonder not sufficiently kept apart from envy at the extraordinary gifts and powers by which the union was accomplished <\s>
<s> this injurious conjunction no longer exists so as to attract the eyes of the nation <\s>
<s> but we look in vain for signs that the opinions habits and feelings of the party are tending towards a restoration of that genuine english character by which alone the confidence of the sound part of the people can be recovered <\s>
<s> the public life of the candidate who now for the first time solicits your suffrages my brother freeholders cannot however without injustice to that party be deemed a fair exponent of its political opinions <\s>
<s> it has indeed been too tolerant with mr <\s>
<s> brougham while he was labouring to ingraft certain sour cuttings from the wild wood of ultra reform on the reverend though somewhat decayed stock of that tree of whiggism which flourished proudly under the cultivation of our ancestors <\s>
<s> this indulgence and others like it will embolden him to aim at passing himself off as the delegate of opposition and the authorized pleader of their cause <\s>
<s> but time that judge from whom none but triflers appeal to conjecture has decided upon leading principles and main events and given the verdict against his clients <\s>
<s> while with a ready tongue the advocate of a disappointed party is filling one scale do you with a clear memory and apt judgment silently throw in what of right belongs to the other and the result will be that no sensible man among you who has supported the present members on account of their steady adherence to ministers can be induced to change his conduct or be persuaded that the hour is either come or approaching when for the sake of bringing the power of opposition in this county nearer to an equality with that of ministers it will be his duty to vote against those representatives in whom he has hitherto confided <\s>
<s> brougham had not individually passed far beyond the line of that party if his conduct had been such that even they themselves would admit that he truly belonged to them the exception would still lie against the general rule and will remain till the character of men and measures materially changes for the better assuredly on the one side if not for the worse on the other <\s>
<s> remember what england might have been with an administration countenancing french doctrines at the dawn of the french revolution and suffering them as it advanced to be sown with every wind that came across the channel <\s>
<s> think what was the state of europe before the french emperor the apparent and in too many respects the real idol of opposition was overthrown <\s>
<s> numbers i am aware do not cease vehemently to maintain that the late war was neither just nor necessary that the ostensible and real causes of it were widely different that it was not begun and persisted in for the purpose of withstanding foreign aggression and in defence of social order but from unprincipled ambition in the powers of europe eager to seize that opportunity of augmenting their territories at the expence of distracted and enfeebled france events ever to be lamented do i grant give too much colour to those affirmations <\s>
<s> but this was a war upon a large scale wherein many belligerents took part and no one who distinctly remembers the state of europe at its commencement will be inclined any more to question that the alleged motives had a solid foundation because then or afterwards others might mix with them than he would doubt that the maintenance of christianity and the reduction of the power of the infidels were the principal motives of the crusades because roving adventurers joining in those expeditions turned them to their own profit <\s>
<s> traders and hypocrites may make part of a caravan bound to mecca but it does not follow that a religious observance is not the prime object of the pilgrimage <\s>
<s> the political fanaticism it deserves no milder name that pervaded the manifesto issued by the duke of brunswick on his entry into france proves that he and the power whose organ he was were swayed on their march by an ambition very different from that of territorial aggrandizement at least if such ambition existed it is plain that feelings of another kind blinded them to the means of gratifying it <\s>

<s> let those who think that they are degraded proclaim their own dishonour <\s>
<s> gentlemen much of my former address originated in deference to that sense of right which is inseparable from the minds of enlightened patriots <\s>
<s> passing from local considerations i wrote under a belief that whatever personal or family leanings might prevail among you you would be moved by a wish to see the supporters of his majesty's ministers and their opponents possessed relatively to each other of that degree of strength which might render both parties in their several capacities most serviceable to the state <\s>
<s> i noticed that this just proportion of strength no longer remained and shewed that the opposition had caused it to be destroyed by holding from the beginning of the french revolution such a course as introduced in parliament discord among themselves deprived them in that house and elsewhere of the respect which from their adversaries they had been accustomed to command turned indifferent persons into enemies and alienated throughout the island the affections of thousands who had been proud to unite with them <\s>
<s> this weakness and degradation deplored by all true friends of the commonweal was sufficiently accounted for without even adverting to the fact that when the disasters of the war had induced the country to forgive and in some degree to forget the alarming attachment of that party to french theories and power heightened by the popularity of hope and expectation was thrown into their hands they disgusted even bigotted adherents by the rapacious use they made of that power stooping to so many offensive compromises and committing so many faults in every department that a government of talents if such be the fruits of talent was proved to be the most mischievous sort of government which england had ever been troubled with <\s>
<s> so that whether in or out of place an evil genius seemed to attend them <\s>
<s> how could all this happen <\s>
<s> for the fundamental reason that neither the religion the laws the morals the manners nor the literature of the country especially as contrasted with those of france were prized by the leaders of the party as they deserved <\s>
<s> it is a notorious fact that among their personal friends was scarcely to be found a single clergyman of distinction so that how to dispose of their ecclesiastical patronage in a manner that might do them credit they were almost as ignorant as strangers landed for the first time in a foreign country <\s>
<s> this is not to be accounted for on any supposition since the education of men of rank naturally devolves on those members of our universities who choose the church for their profession but that of a repugnance on their part to associate with persons of grave character and decorous manners <\s>
<s> is the distracted remnant of the party now surviving improved in that respect <\s>
<s> the dazzling talents with which it was once distinguished have passed away pleasure and dissipation are no longer in that quarter exhibited to the world in such reconcilement with business as excited dispositions to forgive what could not be approved and a species of wonder not sufficiently kept apart from envy at the extraordinary gifts and powers by which the union was accomplished <\s>
<s> this injurious conjunction no longer exists so as to attract the eyes of the nation <\s>
<s> but we look in vain for signs that the opinions habits and feelings of the party are tending towards a restoration of that genuine english character by which alone the confidence of the sound part of the people can be recovered <\s>
<s> the public life of the candidate who now for the first time solicits your suffrages my brother freeholders cannot however without injustice to that party be deemed a fair exponent of its political opinions <\s>
<s> it has indeed been too tolerant with mr <\s>
<s> brougham while he was labouring to ingraft certain sour cuttings from the wild wood of ultra reform on the reverend though somewhat decayed stock of that tree of whiggism which flourished proudly under the cultivation of our ancestors <\s>
<s> this indulgence and others like it will embolden him to aim at passing himself off as the delegate of opposition and the authorized pleader of their cause <\s>
<s> but time that judge from whom none but triflers appeal to conjecture has decided upon leading principles and main events and given the verdict against his clients <\s>
<s> while with a ready tongue the advocate of a disappointed party is filling one scale do you with a clear memory and apt judgment silently throw in what of right belongs to the other and the result will be that no sensible man among you who has supported the present members on account of their steady adherence to ministers can be induced to change his conduct or be persuaded that the hour is either come or approaching when for the sake of bringing the power of opposition in this county nearer to an equality with that of ministers it will be his duty to vote against those representatives in whom he has hitherto confided <\s>
<s> brougham had not individually passed far beyond the line of that party if his conduct had been such that even they themselves would admit that he truly belonged to them the exception would still lie against the general rule and will remain till the character of men and measures materially changes for the better assuredly on the one side if not for the worse on the other <\s>
<s> remember what england might have been with an administration countenancing french doctrines at the dawn of the french revolution and suffering them as it advanced to be sown with every wind that came across the channel <\s>
<s> think what was the state of europe before the french emperor the apparent and in too many respects the real idol of opposition was overthrown <\s>
<s> numbers i am aware do not cease vehemently to maintain that the late war was neither just nor necessary that the ostensible and real causes of it were widely different that it was not begun and persisted in for the purpose of withstanding foreign aggression and in defence of social order but from unprincipled ambition in the powers of europe eager to seize that opportunity of augmenting their territories at the expence of distracted and enfeebled france events ever to be lamented do i grant give too much colour to those affirmations <\s>
<s> but this was a war upon a large scale wherein many belligerents took part and no one who distinctly remembers the state of europe at its commencement will be inclined any more to question that the alleged motives had a solid foundation because then or afterwards others might mix with them than he would doubt that the maintenance of christianity and the reduction of the power of the infidels were the principal motives of the crusades because roving adventurers joining in those expeditions turned them to their own profit <\s>
<s> traders and hypocrites may make part of a caravan bound to mecca but it does not follow that a religious observance is not the prime object of the pilgrimage <\s>
<s> the political fanaticism it deserves no milder name that pervaded the manifesto issued by the duke of brunswick on his entry into france proves that he and the power whose organ he was were swayed on their march by an ambition very different from that of territorial aggrandizement at least if such ambition existed it is plain that feelings of another kind blinded them to the means of gratifying it <\s>
<s> nevertheless we must acknowledge the passion soon manifested itself and in a quarter where it was least excusable <\s>
<s> the seizure of valenciennes in the name of the emperor of germany was an act of such glaring rapacity and gave the lie so unfeelingly to all that had been professed that the then ministers of great britain doubtless opposed the intention with a strong remonstrance <\s>
<s> but the dictates of magnanimity which in such cases is but another word for high and sage policy would have been 'this unjust act must either be abandoned or great britain shall retire from a contest which if such principles are to govern or interfere with the conduct of it cannot but be calamitous <\s>
<s> a threat to this purpose was either not given or not acted upon <\s>
<s> from that moment the alliance of the french loyalists with the coalesced powers seemed to have no ground of rational patriotism to stand upon <\s>
<s> their professed helpers became their worst enemies and numbers among them not only began to wish for the defeat of their false friends but joined themselves to their fellow countrymen of all parties who were labouring to effect it but the military successes of the french arising mainly from this want of principle in the confederate powers in course of time placed the policy and justice of the war upon a new footing <\s>
<s> however men might differ about the necessity or reasonableness of resorting to arms in the first instance things were brought to such a state that among the disinterested and dispassionate there could be but one opinion even if nothing higher than security was aimed at on the demand for the utmost strength of the nation being put forth in the prosecution of the war till it should assume a more hopeful aspect and now it was that ministers made ample amends for past subserviency to selfish coadjutors and proved themselves worthy of being entrusted with the fate of europe <\s>
<s> while the opposition were taking counsel from their fears and recommending despair while they continued to magnify without scruple the strength of the enemy and to expose misrepresent and therefore increase the weaknesses of their country his majesty's ministers were not daunted though often discouraged they struggled up against adversity with fortitude and persevered heroically throwing themselves upon the honour and wisdom of the country and trusting for the issue to the decrees of a just providence and for this determination everlasting gratitude will attend them <\s>

<s> passing from local considerations i wrote under a belief that whatever personal or family leanings might prevail among you you would be moved by a wish to see the supporters of his majesty's ministers and their opponents possessed relatively to each other of that degree of strength which might render both parties in their several capacities most serviceable to the state <\s>
<s> i noticed that this just proportion of strength no longer remained and shewed that the opposition had caused it to be destroyed by holding from the beginning of the french revolution such a course as introduced in parliament discord among themselves deprived them in that house and elsewhere of the respect which from their adversaries they had been accustomed to command turned indifferent persons into enemies and alienated throughout the island the affections of thousands who had been proud to unite with them <\s>
<s> this weakness and degradation deplored by all true friends of the commonweal was sufficiently accounted for without even adverting to the fact that when the disasters of the war had induced the country to forgive and in some degree to forget the alarming attachment of that party to french theories and power heightened by the popularity of hope and expectation was thrown into their hands they disgusted even bigotted adherents by the rapacious use they made of that power stooping to so many offensive compromises and committing so many faults in every department that a government of talents if such be the fruits of talent was proved to be the most mischievous sort of government which england had ever been troubled with <\s>
<s> so that whether in or out of place an evil genius seemed to attend them <\s>
<s> how could all this happen <\s>
<s> for the fundamental reason that neither the religion the laws the morals the manners nor the literature of the country especially as contrasted with those of france were prized by the leaders of the party as they deserved <\s>
<s> it is a notorious fact that among their personal friends was scarcely to be found a single clergyman of distinction so that how to dispose of their ecclesiastical patronage in a manner that might do them credit they were almost as ignorant as strangers landed for the first time in a foreign country <\s>
<s> this is not to be accounted for on any supposition since the education of men of rank naturally devolves on those members of our universities who choose the church for their profession but that of a repugnance on their part to associate with persons of grave character and decorous manners <\s>
<s> is the distracted remnant of the party now surviving improved in that respect <\s>
<s> the dazzling talents with which it was once distinguished have passed away pleasure and dissipation are no longer in that quarter exhibited to the world in such reconcilement with business as excited dispositions to forgive what could not be approved and a species of wonder not sufficiently kept apart from envy at the extraordinary gifts and powers by which the union was accomplished <\s>
<s> this injurious conjunction no longer exists so as to attract the eyes of the nation <\s>
<s> but we look in vain for signs that the opinions habits and feelings of the party are tending towards a restoration of that genuine english character by which alone the confidence of the sound part of the people can be recovered <\s>
<s> the public life of the candidate who now for the first time solicits your suffrages my brother freeholders cannot however without injustice to that party be deemed a fair exponent of its political opinions <\s>
<s> it has indeed been too tolerant with mr <\s>
<s> brougham while he was labouring to ingraft certain sour cuttings from the wild wood of ultra reform on the reverend though somewhat decayed stock of that tree of whiggism which flourished proudly under the cultivation of our ancestors <\s>
<s> this indulgence and others like it will embolden him to aim at passing himself off as the delegate of opposition and the authorized pleader of their cause <\s>
<s> but time that judge from whom none but triflers appeal to conjecture has decided upon leading principles and main events and given the verdict against his clients <\s>
<s> while with a ready tongue the advocate of a disappointed party is filling one scale do you with a clear memory and apt judgment silently throw in what of right belongs to the other and the result will be that no sensible man among you who has supported the present members on account of their steady adherence to ministers can be induced to change his conduct or be persuaded that the hour is either come or approaching when for the sake of bringing the power of opposition in this county nearer to an equality with that of ministers it will be his duty to vote against those representatives in whom he has hitherto confided <\s>
<s> brougham had not individually passed far beyond the line of that party if his conduct had been such that even they themselves would admit that he truly belonged to them the exception would still lie against the general rule and will remain till the character of men and measures materially changes for the better assuredly on the one side if not for the worse on the other <\s>
<s> remember what england might have been with an administration countenancing french doctrines at the dawn of the french revolution and suffering them as it advanced to be sown with every wind that came across the channel <\s>
<s> think what was the state of europe before the french emperor the apparent and in too many respects the real idol of opposition was overthrown <\s>
<s> numbers i am aware do not cease vehemently to maintain that the late war was neither just nor necessary that the ostensible and real causes of it were widely different that it was not begun and persisted in for the purpose of withstanding foreign aggression and in defence of social order but from unprincipled ambition in the powers of europe eager to seize that opportunity of augmenting their territories at the expence of distracted and enfeebled france events ever to be lamented do i grant give too much colour to those affirmations <\s>
<s> but this was a war upon a large scale wherein many belligerents took part and no one who distinctly remembers the state of europe at its commencement will be inclined any more to question that the alleged motives had a solid foundation because then or afterwards others might mix with them than he would doubt that the maintenance of christianity and the reduction of the power of the infidels were the principal motives of the crusades because roving adventurers joining in those expeditions turned them to their own profit <\s>
<s> traders and hypocrites may make part of a caravan bound to mecca but it does not follow that a religious observance is not the prime object of the pilgrimage <\s>
<s> the political fanaticism it deserves no milder name that pervaded the manifesto issued by the duke of brunswick on his entry into france proves that he and the power whose organ he was were swayed on their march by an ambition very different from that of territorial aggrandizement at least if such ambition existed it is plain that feelings of another kind blinded them to the means of gratifying it <\s>
<s> nevertheless we must acknowledge the passion soon manifested itself and in a quarter where it was least excusable <\s>
<s> the seizure of valenciennes in the name of the emperor of germany was an act of such glaring rapacity and gave the lie so unfeelingly to all that had been professed that the then ministers of great britain doubtless opposed the intention with a strong remonstrance <\s>
<s> but the dictates of magnanimity which in such cases is but another word for high and sage policy would have been 'this unjust act must either be abandoned or great britain shall retire from a contest which if such principles are to govern or interfere with the conduct of it cannot but be calamitous <\s>
<s> a threat to this purpose was either not given or not acted upon <\s>
<s> from that moment the alliance of the french loyalists with the coalesced powers seemed to have no ground of rational patriotism to stand upon <\s>
<s> their professed helpers became their worst enemies and numbers among them not only began to wish for the defeat of their false friends but joined themselves to their fellow countrymen of all parties who were labouring to effect it but the military successes of the french arising mainly from this want of principle in the confederate powers in course of time placed the policy and justice of the war upon a new footing <\s>
<s> however men might differ about the necessity or reasonableness of resorting to arms in the first instance things were brought to such a state that among the disinterested and dispassionate there could be but one opinion even if nothing higher than security was aimed at on the demand for the utmost strength of the nation being put forth in the prosecution of the war till it should assume a more hopeful aspect and now it was that ministers made ample amends for past subserviency to selfish coadjutors and proved themselves worthy of being entrusted with the fate of europe <\s>
<s> while the opposition were taking counsel from their fears and recommending despair while they continued to magnify without scruple the strength of the enemy and to expose misrepresent and therefore increase the weaknesses of their country his majesty's ministers were not daunted though often discouraged they struggled up against adversity with fortitude and persevered heroically throwing themselves upon the honour and wisdom of the country and trusting for the issue to the decrees of a just providence and for this determination everlasting gratitude will attend them <\s>
<s> from the internal situation of france produced by the revolution war with the contiguous powers was inevitable sooner or later the evil must have been encountered and it was of little importance whether england took a share in it somewhat earlier than by fallible judgments might be deemed necessary or not <\s>
<s> the frankness with which the faults that were committed have been acknowledged entitles the writer to some regard when speaking from an intimate knowledge of the internal state of france at that time he affirms that the war waged against her was in a liberal interpretation of the words just and necessary <\s>
<s> at all events our nation viewed it in this light <\s>
<s> a large majority of the inhabitants of great britain called for the war and they who will the end will the means the war being deemed necessary taxes became indispensible for its support <\s>
<s> some might prefer one mode of raising them some another but these are minor considerations <\s>
<s> public men united in bodies must act on great principles <\s>
<s> mutual deference is a fundamental requisite for the composition and efficiency of a party for if individual judgment is to be obtruded and insisted upon in subordinate concerns the march of business will be perpetually obstructed <\s>
<s> the leaders will not know whom they can depend upon and therefore will be at a loss what to recommend and how to act <\s>
<s> if a public man differs from his party in essentials conscience and honour demand that he should withdraw but if there be no such difference it is incumbent upon him to submit his personal opinion to the general sense <\s>
<s> he therefore who thought the prosecution of the war necessary could not condemn the public imposts on this consequence the steady adherents of ministers rest their claim to approbation and advance it boldly in defiance of the outcry raised against the government on account of the burthens which the situation of europe compelled it to lay upon the people <\s>
<s> in matters of taste it is a process attended with little advantage and often injurious to compare one set of artists or writers with another <\s>

<s> passing from local considerations i wrote under a belief that whatever personal or family leanings might prevail among you you would be moved by a wish to see the supporters of his majesty's ministers and their opponents possessed relatively to each other of that degree of strength which might render both parties in their several capacities most serviceable to the state <\s>
<s> i noticed that this just proportion of strength no longer remained and shewed that the opposition had caused it to be destroyed by holding from the beginning of the french revolution such a course as introduced in parliament discord among themselves deprived them in that house and elsewhere of the respect which from their adversaries they had been accustomed to command turned indifferent persons into enemies and alienated throughout the island the affections of thousands who had been proud to unite with them <\s>
<s> this weakness and degradation deplored by all true friends of the commonweal was sufficiently accounted for without even adverting to the fact that when the disasters of the war had induced the country to forgive and in some degree to forget the alarming attachment of that party to french theories and power heightened by the popularity of hope and expectation was thrown into their hands they disgusted even bigotted adherents by the rapacious use they made of that power stooping to so many offensive compromises and committing so many faults in every department that a government of talents if such be the fruits of talent was proved to be the most mischievous sort of government which england had ever been troubled with <\s>
<s> so that whether in or out of place an evil genius seemed to attend them <\s>
<s> how could all this happen <\s>
<s> for the fundamental reason that neither the religion the laws the morals the manners nor the literature of the country especially as contrasted with those of france were prized by the leaders of the party as they deserved <\s>
<s> it is a notorious fact that among their personal friends was scarcely to be found a single clergyman of distinction so that how to dispose of their ecclesiastical patronage in a manner that might do them credit they were almost as ignorant as strangers landed for the first time in a foreign country <\s>
<s> this is not to be accounted for on any supposition since the education of men of rank naturally devolves on those members of our universities who choose the church for their profession but that of a repugnance on their part to associate with persons of grave character and decorous manners <\s>
<s> is the distracted remnant of the party now surviving improved in that respect <\s>
<s> the dazzling talents with which it was once distinguished have passed away pleasure and dissipation are no longer in that quarter exhibited to the world in such reconcilement with business as excited dispositions to forgive what could not be approved and a species of wonder not sufficiently kept apart from envy at the extraordinary gifts and powers by which the union was accomplished <\s>
<s> this injurious conjunction no longer exists so as to attract the eyes of the nation <\s>
<s> but we look in vain for signs that the opinions habits and feelings of the party are tending towards a restoration of that genuine english character by which alone the confidence of the sound part of the people can be recovered <\s>
<s> the public life of the candidate who now for the first time solicits your suffrages my brother freeholders cannot however without injustice to that party be deemed a fair exponent of its political opinions <\s>
<s> it has indeed been too tolerant with mr <\s>
<s> brougham while he was labouring to ingraft certain sour cuttings from the wild wood of ultra reform on the reverend though somewhat decayed stock of that tree of whiggism which flourished proudly under the cultivation of our ancestors <\s>
<s> this indulgence and others like it will embolden him to aim at passing himself off as the delegate of opposition and the authorized pleader of their cause <\s>
<s> but time that judge from whom none but triflers appeal to conjecture has decided upon leading principles and main events and given the verdict against his clients <\s>
<s> while with a ready tongue the advocate of a disappointed party is filling one scale do you with a clear memory and apt judgment silently throw in what of right belongs to the other and the result will be that no sensible man among you who has supported the present members on account of their steady adherence to ministers can be induced to change his conduct or be persuaded that the hour is either come or approaching when for the sake of bringing the power of opposition in this county nearer to an equality with that of ministers it will be his duty to vote against those representatives in whom he has hitherto confided <\s>
<s> brougham had not individually passed far beyond the line of that party if his conduct had been such that even they themselves would admit that he truly belonged to them the exception would still lie against the general rule and will remain till the character of men and measures materially changes for the better assuredly on the one side if not for the worse on the other <\s>
<s> remember what england might have been with an administration countenancing french doctrines at the dawn of the french revolution and suffering them as it advanced to be sown with every wind that came across the channel <\s>
<s> think what was the state of europe before the french emperor the apparent and in too many respects the real idol of opposition was overthrown <\s>
<s> numbers i am aware do not cease vehemently to maintain that the late war was neither just nor necessary that the ostensible and real causes of it were widely different that it was not begun and persisted in for the purpose of withstanding foreign aggression and in defence of social order but from unprincipled ambition in the powers of europe eager to seize that opportunity of augmenting their territories at the expence of distracted and enfeebled france events ever to be lamented do i grant give too much colour to those affirmations <\s>
<s> but this was a war upon a large scale wherein many belligerents took part and no one who distinctly remembers the state of europe at its commencement will be inclined any more to question that the alleged motives had a solid foundation because then or afterwards others might mix with them than he would doubt that the maintenance of christianity and the reduction of the power of the infidels were the principal motives of the crusades because roving adventurers joining in those expeditions turned them to their own profit <\s>
<s> traders and hypocrites may make part of a caravan bound to mecca but it does not follow that a religious observance is not the prime object of the pilgrimage <\s>
<s> the political fanaticism it deserves no milder name that pervaded the manifesto issued by the duke of brunswick on his entry into france proves that he and the power whose organ he was were swayed on their march by an ambition very different from that of territorial aggrandizement at least if such ambition existed it is plain that feelings of another kind blinded them to the means of gratifying it <\s>
<s> nevertheless we must acknowledge the passion soon manifested itself and in a quarter where it was least excusable <\s>
<s> the seizure of valenciennes in the name of the emperor of germany was an act of such glaring rapacity and gave the lie so unfeelingly to all that had been professed that the then ministers of great britain doubtless opposed the intention with a strong remonstrance <\s>
<s> but the dictates of magnanimity which in such cases is but another word for high and sage policy would have been 'this unjust act must either be abandoned or great britain shall retire from a contest which if such principles are to govern or interfere with the conduct of it cannot but be calamitous <\s>
<s> a threat to this purpose was either not given or not acted upon <\s>
<s> from that moment the alliance of the french loyalists with the coalesced powers seemed to have no ground of rational patriotism to stand upon <\s>
<s> their professed helpers became their worst enemies and numbers among them not only began to wish for the defeat of their false friends but joined themselves to their fellow countrymen of all parties who were labouring to effect it but the military successes of the french arising mainly from this want of principle in the confederate powers in course of time placed the policy and justice of the war upon a new footing <\s>
<s> however men might differ about the necessity or reasonableness of resorting to arms in the first instance things were brought to such a state that among the disinterested and dispassionate there could be but one opinion even if nothing higher than security was aimed at on the demand for the utmost strength of the nation being put forth in the prosecution of the war till it should assume a more hopeful aspect and now it was that ministers made ample amends for past subserviency to selfish coadjutors and proved themselves worthy of being entrusted with the fate of europe <\s>
<s> while the opposition were taking counsel from their fears and recommending despair while they continued to magnify without scruple the strength of the enemy and to expose misrepresent and therefore increase the weaknesses of their country his majesty's ministers were not daunted though often discouraged they struggled up against adversity with fortitude and persevered heroically throwing themselves upon the honour and wisdom of the country and trusting for the issue to the decrees of a just providence and for this determination everlasting gratitude will attend them <\s>
<s> from the internal situation of france produced by the revolution war with the contiguous powers was inevitable sooner or later the evil must have been encountered and it was of little importance whether england took a share in it somewhat earlier than by fallible judgments might be deemed necessary or not <\s>
<s> the frankness with which the faults that were committed have been acknowledged entitles the writer to some regard when speaking from an intimate knowledge of the internal state of france at that time he affirms that the war waged against her was in a liberal interpretation of the words just and necessary <\s>
<s> at all events our nation viewed it in this light <\s>
<s> a large majority of the inhabitants of great britain called for the war and they who will the end will the means the war being deemed necessary taxes became indispensible for its support <\s>
<s> some might prefer one mode of raising them some another but these are minor considerations <\s>
<s> public men united in bodies must act on great principles <\s>
<s> mutual deference is a fundamental requisite for the composition and efficiency of a party for if individual judgment is to be obtruded and insisted upon in subordinate concerns the march of business will be perpetually obstructed <\s>
<s> the leaders will not know whom they can depend upon and therefore will be at a loss what to recommend and how to act <\s>
<s> if a public man differs from his party in essentials conscience and honour demand that he should withdraw but if there be no such difference it is incumbent upon him to submit his personal opinion to the general sense <\s>
<s> he therefore who thought the prosecution of the war necessary could not condemn the public imposts on this consequence the steady adherents of ministers rest their claim to approbation and advance it boldly in defiance of the outcry raised against the government on account of the burthens which the situation of europe compelled it to lay upon the people <\s>
<s> in matters of taste it is a process attended with little advantage and often injurious to compare one set of artists or writers with another <\s>
<s> but in estimating the merits of public men especially of two parties acting in direct opposition it is not only expedient but indispensible that both should be kept constantly in sight <\s>
<s> the truth or fallacy of french principles and the tendency good or bad of the revolution which sprang out of them and the necessity or non necessity the policy or impolicy of resisting by war the encroachments of republican and imperial france these were the opposite grounds upon which each party staked their credit here we behold them in full contrast with each other to whom shall the crown be given <\s>
<s> on whom has the light fallen <\s>
<s> and who are covered by shade and thick darkness <\s>
<s> the magnanimity which resolved that for principle's sake no efforts should be spared to crush a bestial despotism was acknowledged by every manly spirit whom party degenerating into faction had not vitiated <\s>
<s> that such was the dictate of confiding wisdom had long been inwardly felt and the prudence of the course was evinced by the triumphant issue but to the very completeness of this triumph may be indirectly attributed no small portion of the obloquy how heaped upon those advisers through whom it was achieved <\s>
<s> the power of napoleon buonaparte was overthrown his person has disappeared from the theatre of europe his name has almost deserted the columns of her daily and weekly journals but as he has left no successor as there is no foreign tyrant of sufficient importance to attract hatred by exciting fear many honest english patriots must either find or set up something at home for the employment of those affections <\s>
<s> this is too natural to occasion surprise thousands are so framed that they are but languidly conscious of their love of an object unless while they feel themselves in an active state of aversion to something which they can regard as its opposite thus we see men who had been proud of their attachment to his majesty's ministers during the awful struggle as soon as it was over allowing on the first temptation that proud attachment to be converted into immoderate suspicion and a long experienced gratitude into sudden alienation through this infirmity many were betrayed into taking part with the men whom they had heretofore despised or condemned and assisted them in reviling their own government for suffering among the states of the continent institutions to remain which the respective nations surely the best if not the only judges in the case were unwilling to part with and for having permitted things to be done either just and proper in themselves or if indeed abuses abuses of that kind which great britain had neither right to oppose nor power to prevent <\s>
<s> not a frenchman is in arms in spain <\s>
<s> but alas for the credit of the english cabinet ferdinand though a lawful appears to be a sorry king and the inquisition though venerated by the people of spain as a holy tribunal which has spread a protecting shade over their religion for hundreds of years is among protestants an abomination <\s>
<s> is that however a reason why we should not rejoice that spain is restored to the rank of an independent nation and that her resources do not continue at the disposal of a foreign tyrant for the annoyance of great britain <\s>
<s> prussia no longer receives decrees from the tuilleries but nothing we are told is gained by this deliverance because the sovereign of that country has not participated as far as became him a popular effervescence and has withheld from his subjects certain privileges which they have proved themselves to all but heated judgments not yet qualified to receive <\s>
<s> now if numbers can blame without cause the british cabinet for events falling below their wishes in cases remote from their immediate concerns the reasonableness of their opinions may well be questioned in points where selfish passion is touched to the quick yes in spite of the outcry of such men to the contrary every enlightened politician and discerning patriot however diffident as to what was the exact line of prudence in such arduous circumstances will reprobate the conduct of those who were for reducing public expenditure with a precipitation that might have produced a convulsion in the state <\s>
<s> the habeas corpus act is also our own near concern it was suspended some think without sufficient cause not so however the persons who had the best means of ascertaining the state of the country for they could have been induced to have recourse to a measure at all times so obnoxious by nothing less than a persuasion of its expediency <\s>
<s> but persuasion an objector will say is produced in many ways and even that degree of it which in these matters passes for conviction depends less upon external testimony than on the habits and feelings of those by whom the testimony is to be weighed and decided upon <\s>
<s> a council for the administration of affairs is far from being as favourably circumstanced as a tribunal of law for the party which is to pronounce upon the case has had to procure the evidence the sum and quality of which must needs have been affected by previously existing prejudices and by any bias received in the process of collecting it the privileges of the subject one might think would never be unjustifiably infringed if it were only from considerations of self interest but power is apt to resort to unnecessary rigour in order to supply the deficiencies of authority forfeited by remissness it is also not unfrequently exerted merely to shew that it is possessed to shew this to others while power is a novelty and when it has long ceased to be so to prove it to ourselves <\s>
<s> impatience of mind moreover puts men upon the use of strong and coarse tools when those of lighter make and finer edge with due care might execute the work much better <\s>
<s> above all timidity flies to extremes if the elements were at our command how often would an inundation be called for when a fire engine would have proved equal to the service much more might be urged in this strain and similar suggestions are all that the question will admit of for to suppose a gross appetite of tyranny in government would be an insult to the reader's understanding <\s>
<s> happily for the inhabitants of westmoreland as no dispositions existing among them could furnish a motive for this restrictive measure so they will not be sorry that their remoteness from scenes of public confusion has placed them where they will be slow to give an unqualified opinion upon its merits <\s>
<s> yet it will not escape their discernment that if doubts might have been entertained whether the ignorant and distressed multitude in other parts of the island were actually brought to a state that justified the suspension of this law such doubts must have been weakened if not wholly removed by the subsequent behaviour of those in the upper ranks of society who in order to arraign the government and denounce the laws have seized every opportunity of palliating sedition if not of exculpating treason <\s>
<s> o far better to employ bad men in the detection of foul conspiracies than to excuse and shelter would that i were allowed to confine myself to these words than to reward and honour every one that can contrive to make himself conspicuous by courses which wherever they are not branded with infamy find the national character in a state of degradation ominous if it should spread for the existence of all that ought to be dear to englishmen <\s>
<s> but there are points of domestic policy in which his majesty's ministers not appearing in counterview with their opponents are seen less to their honour <\s>
<s> speaking as an individual and knowing that here i differ from many freeholders with whom it is an honour to co operate in the present struggle i must express my disapprobation of the patronage afforded by several persons in power to a society by which is virtually propagated the notion that priesthood and of course our own inestimable church establishment is superfluous <\s>
<s> i condemn their sanction and this attaches to the whole body of the malevolent and senseless abuse heaped upon the clergy in the matter of tythes through the medium of papers circulated by the agricultural board <\s>
<s> i deprecate the course which some among them take in the catholic question as unconstitutional and deplore the want of discernment evinced by men who persuade themselves that the discontents prevalent in ireland will be either removed or abated by such concession <\s>
<s> with these errors and weaknesses the members of the administration as appears to me may be justly reproached and a still heavier charge will lie against them if the correction of the poor laws be longer deferred <\s>
<s> may they exhibit in treating this momentous subject a tenderness of undeceived humanity on the one side and a sternness of enlightened state policy on the other <\s>
<s> thus and thus only can be checked immediately and in due course of time perhaps removed an evil by which one claim and title is set in array against another in a manner and to an extent that threatens utter subversion to the ancient frame of society <\s>
<s> this is the heaviest burthen that now lies upon england here is a necessity for reform which as it cannot prosper unless it begin from the government and the upper ranks in society has no attraction for demagogues and mob exciting patriots <\s>
<s> they understand their game and as if the people could in no way be so effectually benefited as by rendering their government suspected they declaim against taxes and by their clamours for reduction of public expenditure drown the counter suggestions from the still small voice of moderation appealing to circumstances <\s>
<s> cry aloud and spare not retrench and lop off <\s>
<s> and so they proceeded with the huzza of the multitude at their heels till they had produced an extreme embarrassment in the government and instant distress and misery among the people <\s>
<s> one of the most importunate of that class of economists which parliament contained now gentlemen solicits the honour of representing you and merit may perhaps be claimed for him for his exertions upon that occasion <\s>
<s> if it be praiseworthy to have contributed to cast shoals of our deserving countrymen adrift without regard to their past services that praise cannot be denied him if it be commendable to have availed himself of inordinate momentary passion to carry measures whereby the general weal was sacrificed whether designedly for the attainment of popularity or in the self applauding sincerity of a heated mind that praise is due to mr <\s>
<s> brougham and his coadjutors <\s>
<s> but to the judicious freeholders of westmoreland whether gentry or yeomanry rich or poor he will in vain adduce this or any other part of the recent conduct of opposition as a motive for strengthening their interests amongst us <\s>
<s> no freeholders we must wait assuring them that they shall have a reasonable portion of our support as soon as they have proved that they deserve it <\s>
<s> till that time comes it will not grieve us that this county should supply two representatives to uphold the servants of the crown even if both should continue through unavoidable circumstances to issue from one family amongst us <\s>
<s> till that change takes place we will treat with scorn the senseless outcry for the recovery of an independence which has never been lost <\s>
<s> we are have been and will remain independent and the host of men respectable on every account who have publicly avowed their desire to maintain our present representatives in their seats deem it insolence to assert the contrary <\s>
<s> they are independent in every rational sense of the word acknowledging however that they rest upon a principle and are incorporated with an interest and this they regard as a proof that their affections are sane and their understandings superior to illusion <\s>
<s> but in certain vocabularies liberty is synonymous with licence and to be free as explained by some is to live and act without restraint <\s>
<s> in like manner independence according to the meaning of their interpretation is the explosive energy of conceit making blind havoc with expediency <\s>
<s> it is a presumptuous spirit at war with all the passive worth of mankind <\s>
<s> the independence which they boast of despises habit and time honoured forms of subordination it consists in breaking old ties upon new temptations in casting off the modest garb of private obligation to strut about in the glittering armour of public virtue in sacrificing with jacobinical infatuation the near to the remote and preferring to what has been known and tried that which has no distinct existence even in imagination in renouncing with voluble tongue and vain heart every thing intricate in motive and mixed in quality in a downright passion of love for absolute unapproachable patriotism <\s>
<s> in short the independence these reformers bawl for is the worthy precursor of the liberty they adore making her first essay by starting out of the course for the pleasure of falling into the ditch and asserting her heaven born vigour by soaring above the level of humanity in profession that it may more conspicuously appear how far she can fall below it in practice <\s>
<s> to this spurious independence the friends of our present representatives lay no claim <\s>
<s> they assert in the face of the world that those representatives hold their seats by free election that has placed them there and why should we wish to change what we do not disapprove of that which could not have been without our approbation <\s>
<s> but this county has not for a long time been disturbed by electioneering contests is there no species of choice then but that which is accompanied with commotion and clamour <\s>
<s> do silent acquiescence and deliberate consent pass for nothing <\s>
<s> being contented what could we seek for more <\s>
<s> being satisfied why should we stir for stirring's sake <\s>
<s> uproar and disorder even these we could tolerate on a justifying occasion but it is no sign of prudence to court them unnecessarily nor of temper to invite them wantonly <\s>
<s> he who resorts to substantial unruliness for the redress of imaginary grievances provokes certain mischief and often in the end produces calamity which would excite little compassion could it be confined to its original author <\s>
<s> let those who think that they are degraded proclaim their own dishonour <\s>

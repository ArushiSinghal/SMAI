<s> hence a deep red light spread over the whole prospect in undisturbed harmony with the red town the brown red woods and the yellow red reeds on the skirts of the lake <\s>

<s> from the turnings windings and indentations of the shore the views vary almost every ten steps and the whole has a sort of majestic beauty a feminine grandeur <\s>
<s> at the north of the great lake and peeping over it i see the seven church towers of lubec at the distance of twelve or thirteen miles yet as distinctly as if they were not three <\s>
<s> the only defect in the view is that ratzeburg is built entirely of red bricks and all the houses roofed with red tiles <\s>
<s> to the eye therefore it presents a clump of brick dust red <\s>

<s> twenty minutes past five i saw the town perfectly beautiful and the whole softened down into complete keeping if i may borrow a term from the painters <\s>
<s> the sky over ratzeburg and all the east was a pure evening blue while over the west it was covered with light sandy clouds <\s>
<s> hence a deep red light spread over the whole prospect in undisturbed harmony with the red town the brown red woods and the yellow red reeds on the skirts of the lake <\s>

<s> the sky over ratzeburg and all the east was a pure evening blue while over the west it was covered with light sandy clouds <\s>

<s> from within three miles of hamburg almost to molln which is thirty miles from it the country as far as i could see it was a dead flat only varied by woods <\s>
<s> at molln it became more beautiful <\s>
<s> i observed a small lake nearly surrounded with groves and a palace in view belonging to the king of great britain and inhabited by the inspector of the forests <\s>
<s> we were nearly the same time in travelling the thirty five miles from hamburg to ratzeburg as we had been in going from london to yarmouth one hundred and twenty six miles <\s>
<s> the lake of ratzeburg runs from south to north about nine miles in length and varying in breadth from three miles to half a mile <\s>
<s> about a mile from the southernmost point it is divided into two of course very unequal parts by an island which being connected by a bridge and a narrow slip of land with the one shore and by another bridge of immense length with the other shore forms a complete isthmus <\s>
<s> on this island the town of ratzeburg is built <\s>
<s> the pastor's house or vicarage together with the amtmann s amtsschreiber's and the church stands near the summit of a hill which slopes down to the slip of land and the little bridge from which through a superb military gate you step into the island town of ratzeburg <\s>
<s> this again is itself a little hill by ascending and descending which you arrive at the long bridge and so to the other shore <\s>
<s> the water to the south of the town is called the little lake which however almost engrosses the beauties of the whole the shores being just often enough green and bare to give the proper effect to the magnificent groves which occupy the greater part of their circumference <\s>
<s> from the turnings windings and indentations of the shore the views vary almost every ten steps and the whole has a sort of majestic beauty a feminine grandeur <\s>
<s> at the north of the great lake and peeping over it i see the seven church towers of lubec at the distance of twelve or thirteen miles yet as distinctly as if they were not three <\s>
<s> the only defect in the view is that ratzeburg is built entirely of red bricks and all the houses roofed with red tiles <\s>
<s> to the eye therefore it presents a clump of brick dust red <\s>
<s> yet this evening oct <\s>
<s> twenty minutes past five i saw the town perfectly beautiful and the whole softened down into complete keeping if i may borrow a term from the painters <\s>
<s> the sky over ratzeburg and all the east was a pure evening blue while over the west it was covered with light sandy clouds <\s>
<s> hence a deep red light spread over the whole prospect in undisturbed harmony with the red town the brown red woods and the yellow red reeds on the skirts of the lake <\s>
<s> two or three boats with single persons paddling them floated up and down in the rich light which not only was itself in harmony with all but brought all into harmony <\s>

<s> 27th to take leave of my friend who travels southward and returned hither on the monday following <\s>
<s> from empfelde a village half way from ratzeburg i walked to hamburg through deep sandy roads and a dreary flat the soil everywhere white hungry and excessively pulverised but the approach to the city is pleasing <\s>
<s> light cool country houses which you can look through and see the gardens behind them with arbours and trellis work and thick vegetable walls and trees in cloisters and piazzas each house with neat rails before it and green seats within the rails <\s>
<s> every object whether the growth of nature or the work of man was neat and artificial <\s>
<s> it pleased me far better than if the houses and gardens and pleasure fields had been in a nobler taste for this nobler taste would have been mere apery <\s>
<s> the busy anxious money loving merchant of hamburg could only have adopted he could not have enjoyed the simplicity of nature <\s>
<s> the mind begins to love nature by imitating human conveniences in nature but this is a step in intellect though a low one and were it not so yet all around me spoke of innocent enjoyment and sensitive comforts and i entered with unscrupulous sympathy into the enjoyments and comforts even of the busy anxious money loving merchants of hamburg <\s>

<s> we were nearly the same time in travelling the thirty five miles from hamburg to ratzeburg as we had been in going from london to yarmouth one hundred and twenty six miles <\s>
<s> the lake of ratzeburg runs from south to north about nine miles in length and varying in breadth from three miles to half a mile <\s>
<s> about a mile from the southernmost point it is divided into two of course very unequal parts by an island which being connected by a bridge and a narrow slip of land with the one shore and by another bridge of immense length with the other shore forms a complete isthmus <\s>

<s> the pastor's house or vicarage together with the amtmann s amtsschreiber's and the church stands near the summit of a hill which slopes down to the slip of land and the little bridge from which through a superb military gate you step into the island town of ratzeburg <\s>
<s> this again is itself a little hill by ascending and descending which you arrive at the long bridge and so to the other shore <\s>
<s> the water to the south of the town is called the little lake which however almost engrosses the beauties of the whole the shores being just often enough green and bare to give the proper effect to the magnificent groves which occupy the greater part of their circumference <\s>
<s> from the turnings windings and indentations of the shore the views vary almost every ten steps and the whole has a sort of majestic beauty a feminine grandeur <\s>
<s> at the north of the great lake and peeping over it i see the seven church towers of lubec at the distance of twelve or thirteen miles yet as distinctly as if they were not three <\s>
<s> the only defect in the view is that ratzeburg is built entirely of red bricks and all the houses roofed with red tiles <\s>
<s> to the eye therefore it presents a clump of brick dust red <\s>
<s> yet this evening oct <\s>
<s> twenty minutes past five i saw the town perfectly beautiful and the whole softened down into complete keeping if i may borrow a term from the painters <\s>
<s> the sky over ratzeburg and all the east was a pure evening blue while over the west it was covered with light sandy clouds <\s>
<s> hence a deep red light spread over the whole prospect in undisturbed harmony with the red town the brown red woods and the yellow red reeds on the skirts of the lake <\s>
<s> two or three boats with single persons paddling them floated up and down in the rich light which not only was itself in harmony with all but brought all into harmony <\s>
<s> i should have told you that i went back to hamburg on thursday sept <\s>

<s> from empfelde a village half way from ratzeburg i walked to hamburg through deep sandy roads and a dreary flat the soil everywhere white hungry and excessively pulverised but the approach to the city is pleasing <\s>
<s> light cool country houses which you can look through and see the gardens behind them with arbours and trellis work and thick vegetable walls and trees in cloisters and piazzas each house with neat rails before it and green seats within the rails <\s>

<s> it pleased me far better than if the houses and gardens and pleasure fields had been in a nobler taste for this nobler taste would have been mere apery <\s>

<s> from the turnings windings and indentations of the shore the views vary almost every ten steps and the whole has a sort of majestic beauty a feminine grandeur <\s>
<s> at the north of the great lake and peeping over it i see the seven church towers of lubec at the distance of twelve or thirteen miles yet as distinctly as if they were not three <\s>

<s> to the eye therefore it presents a clump of brick dust red <\s>

<s> twenty minutes past five i saw the town perfectly beautiful and the whole softened down into complete keeping if i may borrow a term from the painters <\s>
<s> the sky over ratzeburg and all the east was a pure evening blue while over the west it was covered with light sandy clouds <\s>
<s> hence a deep red light spread over the whole prospect in undisturbed harmony with the red town the brown red woods and the yellow red reeds on the skirts of the lake <\s>

<s> we were nearly the same time in travelling the thirty five miles from hamburg to ratzeburg as we had been in going from london to yarmouth one hundred and twenty six miles <\s>
<s> the lake of ratzeburg runs from south to north about nine miles in length and varying in breadth from three miles to half a mile <\s>
<s> about a mile from the southernmost point it is divided into two of course very unequal parts by an island which being connected by a bridge and a narrow slip of land with the one shore and by another bridge of immense length with the other shore forms a complete isthmus <\s>
<s> on this island the town of ratzeburg is built <\s>
<s> the pastor's house or vicarage together with the amtmann s amtsschreiber's and the church stands near the summit of a hill which slopes down to the slip of land and the little bridge from which through a superb military gate you step into the island town of ratzeburg <\s>
<s> this again is itself a little hill by ascending and descending which you arrive at the long bridge and so to the other shore <\s>
<s> the water to the south of the town is called the little lake which however almost engrosses the beauties of the whole the shores being just often enough green and bare to give the proper effect to the magnificent groves which occupy the greater part of their circumference <\s>
<s> from the turnings windings and indentations of the shore the views vary almost every ten steps and the whole has a sort of majestic beauty a feminine grandeur <\s>
<s> at the north of the great lake and peeping over it i see the seven church towers of lubec at the distance of twelve or thirteen miles yet as distinctly as if they were not three <\s>
<s> the only defect in the view is that ratzeburg is built entirely of red bricks and all the houses roofed with red tiles <\s>
<s> to the eye therefore it presents a clump of brick dust red <\s>
<s> yet this evening oct <\s>
<s> twenty minutes past five i saw the town perfectly beautiful and the whole softened down into complete keeping if i may borrow a term from the painters <\s>
<s> the sky over ratzeburg and all the east was a pure evening blue while over the west it was covered with light sandy clouds <\s>
<s> hence a deep red light spread over the whole prospect in undisturbed harmony with the red town the brown red woods and the yellow red reeds on the skirts of the lake <\s>
<s> two or three boats with single persons paddling them floated up and down in the rich light which not only was itself in harmony with all but brought all into harmony <\s>

<s> no little fish thrown back again into the water no fly unimprisoned from a child's hand could more buoyantly enjoy its element than i this clean and peaceful house with this lovely view of the town groves and lake of ratzeburg from the window at which i am writing <\s>
<s> my spirits certainly and my health i fancied were beginning to sink under the noise dirt and unwholesome air of our hamburg hotel <\s>
<s> i left it on sunday sept <\s>
<s> with a letter of introduction from the poet klopstock to the amtmann of ratzeburg <\s>
<s> the amtmann received me with kindness and introduced me to the worthy pastor who agreed to board and lodge me for any length of time not less than a month <\s>
<s> the vehicle in which i took my place was considerably larger than an english stage coach to which it bore much the same proportion and rude resemblance that an elephant's ear does to the human <\s>
<s> its top was composed of naked boards of different colours and seeming to have been parts of different wainscots <\s>
<s> instead of windows there were leathern curtains with a little eye of glass in each they perfectly answered the purpose of keeping out the prospect and letting in the cold <\s>
<s> i could observe little therefore but the inns and farm houses at which we stopped <\s>
<s> they were all alike except in size one great room like a barn with a hay loft over it the straw and hay dangling in tufts through the boards which formed the ceiling of the room and the floor of the loft <\s>
<s> from this room which is paved like a street sometimes one sometimes two smaller ones are enclosed at one end <\s>
<s> these are commonly floored <\s>
<s> in the large room the cattle pigs poultry men women and children live in amicable community yet there was an appearance of cleanliness and rustic comfort <\s>
<s> one of these houses i measured <\s>
<s> it was an hundred feet in length <\s>
<s> the apartments were taken off from one corner <\s>
<s> between these and the stalls there was a small interspace and here the breadth was forty eight feet but thirty two where the stalls were of course the stalls were on each side eight feet in depth <\s>
<s> the faces of the cows c <\s>
<s> were turned towards the room indeed they were in it so that they had at least the comfort of seeing each other's faces <\s>
<s> stall feeding is universal in this part of germany a practice concerning which the agriculturist and the poet are likely to entertain opposite opinions or at least to have very different feelings <\s>
<s> the wood work of these buildings on the outside is left unplastered as in old houses among us and being painted red and green it cuts and tesselates the buildings very gaily <\s>
<s> from within three miles of hamburg almost to molln which is thirty miles from it the country as far as i could see it was a dead flat only varied by woods <\s>
<s> at molln it became more beautiful <\s>
<s> i observed a small lake nearly surrounded with groves and a palace in view belonging to the king of great britain and inhabited by the inspector of the forests <\s>
<s> we were nearly the same time in travelling the thirty five miles from hamburg to ratzeburg as we had been in going from london to yarmouth one hundred and twenty six miles <\s>
<s> the lake of ratzeburg runs from south to north about nine miles in length and varying in breadth from three miles to half a mile <\s>
<s> about a mile from the southernmost point it is divided into two of course very unequal parts by an island which being connected by a bridge and a narrow slip of land with the one shore and by another bridge of immense length with the other shore forms a complete isthmus <\s>
<s> on this island the town of ratzeburg is built <\s>
<s> the pastor's house or vicarage together with the amtmann s amtsschreiber's and the church stands near the summit of a hill which slopes down to the slip of land and the little bridge from which through a superb military gate you step into the island town of ratzeburg <\s>
<s> this again is itself a little hill by ascending and descending which you arrive at the long bridge and so to the other shore <\s>
<s> the water to the south of the town is called the little lake which however almost engrosses the beauties of the whole the shores being just often enough green and bare to give the proper effect to the magnificent groves which occupy the greater part of their circumference <\s>
<s> from the turnings windings and indentations of the shore the views vary almost every ten steps and the whole has a sort of majestic beauty a feminine grandeur <\s>
<s> at the north of the great lake and peeping over it i see the seven church towers of lubec at the distance of twelve or thirteen miles yet as distinctly as if they were not three <\s>
<s> the only defect in the view is that ratzeburg is built entirely of red bricks and all the houses roofed with red tiles <\s>
<s> to the eye therefore it presents a clump of brick dust red <\s>
<s> yet this evening oct <\s>
<s> twenty minutes past five i saw the town perfectly beautiful and the whole softened down into complete keeping if i may borrow a term from the painters <\s>
<s> the sky over ratzeburg and all the east was a pure evening blue while over the west it was covered with light sandy clouds <\s>
<s> hence a deep red light spread over the whole prospect in undisturbed harmony with the red town the brown red woods and the yellow red reeds on the skirts of the lake <\s>
<s> two or three boats with single persons paddling them floated up and down in the rich light which not only was itself in harmony with all but brought all into harmony <\s>
<s> i should have told you that i went back to hamburg on thursday sept <\s>
<s> 27th to take leave of my friend who travels southward and returned hither on the monday following <\s>
<s> from empfelde a village half way from ratzeburg i walked to hamburg through deep sandy roads and a dreary flat the soil everywhere white hungry and excessively pulverised but the approach to the city is pleasing <\s>
<s> light cool country houses which you can look through and see the gardens behind them with arbours and trellis work and thick vegetable walls and trees in cloisters and piazzas each house with neat rails before it and green seats within the rails <\s>
<s> every object whether the growth of nature or the work of man was neat and artificial <\s>
<s> it pleased me far better than if the houses and gardens and pleasure fields had been in a nobler taste for this nobler taste would have been mere apery <\s>
<s> the busy anxious money loving merchant of hamburg could only have adopted he could not have enjoyed the simplicity of nature <\s>
<s> the mind begins to love nature by imitating human conveniences in nature but this is a step in intellect though a low one and were it not so yet all around me spoke of innocent enjoyment and sensitive comforts and i entered with unscrupulous sympathy into the enjoyments and comforts even of the busy anxious money loving merchants of hamburg <\s>

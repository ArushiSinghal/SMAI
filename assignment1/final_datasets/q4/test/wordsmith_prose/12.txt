<s> in those words it was his purpose to censure that barren contemplation which rests satisfied with itself in cases where the thoughts are of such quality that they may and ought to be embodied in action <\s>

<s> yet beginning from the perception of this established superiority we do not suppose that the youth whom we wish to guide and encourage is to be insensible to those influences of wealth or rank or station by which the bulk of mankind are swayed <\s>

<s> in fact there is no such virtue <\s>

<s> letter to a friend 1806 <\s>
<s> my dear sir i am happy to hear of the instructions which you are preparing for parents and feel honoured by your having offered to me such an opportunity of conveying to the public any information i may possess upon the subject but in truth i am so little competent in the present unarranged state of my ideas to write any thing of value that it would be the highest presumption in me to attempt it <\s>
<s> this is not mock modesty but rigorous and sober truth <\s>
<s> as to the case of your own child i will set down a few thoughts which i do not hope will throw much light on your mind but they will show my willingness to do the little that is in my power <\s>
<s> the child being the child of a man like you what i have to say will lie in small compass <\s>
<s> i consider the facts which you mention as indicative of what is commonly called sensibility and of quickness and talent and shall take for granted that they are so you add that the child is too much noticed by grown people and apprehend selfishness <\s>
<s> such a child will almost always be too much noticed and it is scarcely possible entirely to guard against the evil hence vanity and under bad management selfishness of the worst kind <\s>
<s> and true it is that under better and even the best management such constitutions are liable to selfishness not showing itself in the shape of tyranny caprice avarice meanness envy skulking and base self reference but selfishness of a worthier kind yet still rightly called by that name <\s>
<s> what i mean i shall explain afterwards <\s>
<s> vanity is not the necessary or even natural growth of such a temperament quite the contrary <\s>
<s> such a child if neglected and suffered to run wild would probably be entirely free from vanity owing to the liveliness of its feelings and the number of its resources <\s>
<s> it would be by nature independent and sufficient for itself <\s>
<s> but as such children in these times in particular are rarely if ever neglected or rather rarely if ever not far too much noticed it is a hundred to one your child will have more vanity than you could wish <\s>
<s> this is one evil to be guarded against <\s>
<s> formerly indeed till within these few years children were very carelessly brought up at present they too early and too habitually feel their own importance from the solicitude and unremitting attendance which is bestowed upon them <\s>
<s> a child like yours i believe unless under the wisest guidance would prosper most where she was the least noticed and the least made of i mean more than this where she received the least cultivation <\s>
<s> she does not stand in need of the stimulus of praise as much as can benefit her i e as much as her nature requires it will be impossible to withhold from her ); nor of being provoked to exertion or even if she be not injudiciously thwarted to industry <\s>
<s> nor can there be any need to be sedulous in calling out her affections her own lively enjoyments will do all this for her and also point out what is to be done to her <\s>
<s> but take all the pains you can she will be too much noticed <\s>
<s> other evils will also beset her arising more from herself and how are these to be obviated <\s>
<s> but first let us attempt to find what these evils will be <\s>
<s> observe i put all gross mismanagement out of the question and i believe they will then probably be as follows first as mentioned before a considerable portion of vanity <\s>
<s> but if the child be not constrained too much and be left sufficiently to her own pursuits and be not too anxiously tended and have not her mind planted over by art with likings that do not spring naturally up in it this will by the liveliness of her independent enjoyment almost entirely disappear and she will become modest and diffident and being not apt from the same ruling cause i mean the freshness of her own sensations to compare herself with others she will hold herself in too humble estimation <\s>
<s> but she will probably still be selfish and this brings me to the explanation of what i hinted at before viz in what manner she will be selfish <\s>
<s> it appears then to me that all the permanent evils which you have to apprehend for your daughter supposing you should live to educate her yourself may be referred to this principle an undue predominance of present objects over absent ones which as she will surely be distinguished by an extreme love of those about her will produce a certain restlessness of mind calling perpetually for proofs of ever living regard and affection she must be loved as much and in the same way as she loves or she will not be satisfied <\s>
<s> hence quickness in taking offence petty jealousies and apprehensions lest she is neglected or loses ground in people's love a want of a calm and steady sense of her own merits to secure her from these fits of imagined slights for in the first place she will as is hinted at before be in general deficient in this just estimation of her own worth and will further be apt to forget everything of that kind in the present sense of supposed injury <\s>
<s> she will all which is referable to the same cause in the company of others have too constant a craving for sympathy up to a height beyond what her companions are capable of bestowing this will often be mortifying to herself and burthensome to others and should circumstances be untoward and her mind be not sufficiently furnished with ideas and knowledge this craving would be most pernicious to herself preying upon mind and body <\s>
<s> she will be too easily pleased apt to overrate the merits of new acquaintances subject to fits of over love and over joy in absence from those she loves full of fears and apprehensions c injurious to her health her passions for the most part will be happy and good but she will be too little mistress of them <\s>
<s> the distinctions which her intellect will make will be apt able and just but in conversation she will be prone to overshoot herself and commit eloquent blunders through eagerness <\s>
<s> in fine her manners will be frank and ardent but they will want dignity and a want of dignity will be the general defect of her character <\s>
<s> something of this sort of character which i have thus loosely sketched and something of the sort of selfishness to which i have adverted it seems to me that under the best management you have reason to apprehend for your daughter <\s>
<s> if she should happen to be an only child or the only sister of brothers who would probably idolize her one might prophesy almost with absolute confidence that most of these qualities would be found in her in a great degree <\s>
<s> how then is the evil to be softened down or prevented <\s>
<s> assuredly not by mortifying her which is the course commonly pursued with such tempers nor by preaching to her about her own defects nor by overrunning her infancy with books about good boys and girls and bad boys and girls and all that trumpery but and this is the only important thing i have to say upon the subject by putting her in the way of acquiring without measure or limit such knowledge as will lead her out of herself such knowledge as is interesting for its own sake things known because they are interesting not interesting because they are known in a word by leaving her at liberty to luxuriate in such feelings and images as will feed her mind in silent pleasure <\s>
<s> this nourishment is contained in fairy tales romances the best biographies and histories and such parts of natural history relating to the powers and appearances of the earth and elements and the habits and structure of animals as belong to it not as an art or science but as a magazine of form and feeling <\s>
<s> this kind of knowledge is purely good a direct antidote to every evil to be apprehended and food absolutely necessary to preserve the mind of a child like yours from morbid appetites <\s>
<s> next to these objects comes such knowledge as while it is chiefly interesting for its own sake admits the fellowship of another sort of pleasure that of complacence from the conscious exertion of the faculties and love of praise <\s>
<s> the accomplishments of dancing music and drawing rank under this head grammar learning of languages botany probably and out of the way knowledge of arts and manufactures c <\s>
<s> the second class of objects as far as they tend to feed vanity and self conceit are evil but let them have their just proportion in the plan of education and they will afterwards contribute to destroy these by furnishing the mind with power and independent gratification the vanity will disappear and the good will remain <\s>
<s> lastly comes that class of objects which are interesting almost solely because they are known and the knowledge may be displayed and this unfortunately comprehends three fourths of what according to the plan of modern education children's heads are stuffed with that is minute remote or trifling facts in geography topography natural history chronology c or acquisitions in art or accomplishments which the child makes by rote and which are quite beyond its age things of no value in themselves but as they show cleverness things hurtful to any temper but to a child like yours absolute poison <\s>
<s> having said thus much it seems almost impertinent to add that your child above all should i might say be chained down to the severest attention to truth i mean to the minutest accuracy in every thing which she relates this will strike at the root of evil by teaching her to form correct notions of present things and will steadily strengthen her mind <\s>
<s> much caution should be taken not to damp her natural vivacity for this may have a very bad effect and by the indirect influence of the example of manly and dignified manners any excessive wildnesses of her own will be best kept under <\s>
<s> most unrelaxing firmness should from the present hour be maintained in withstanding such of her desires as are grossly unreasonable <\s>
<s> in those words it was his purpose to censure that barren contemplation which rests satisfied with itself in cases where the thoughts are of such quality that they may and ought to be embodied in action <\s>
<s> but he speaks now of the general superiority of thought to action as proceeding and governing all action that moves to salutary purposes and secondly as leading to elevation the absolute possession of the individual mind and to a consistency or harmony of the being within itself which no outward agency can reach to disturb or to impair and lastly as producing works of pure science or of the combined faculties of imagination feeling and reason works which both from their independence in their origin upon accident their nature their duration and the wide spread of their influence are entitled rightly to take place of the noblest and most beneficent deeds of heroes statesmen legislators or warriors <\s>
<s> yet beginning from the perception of this established superiority we do not suppose that the youth whom we wish to guide and encourage is to be insensible to those influences of wealth or rank or station by which the bulk of mankind are swayed <\s>
<s> our eyes have not been fixed upon virtue which lies apart from human nature or transcends it <\s>
<s> in fact there is no such virtue <\s>
<s> we neither suppose nor wish him to undervalue or slight these distinctions as modes of power things that may enable him to be more useful to his contemporaries nor as gratifications that may confer dignity upon his living person and through him upon those who love him nor as they may connect his name through a family to be founded by his success in a closer chain of gratitude with some portion of posterity who shall speak of him as among their ancestry with a more tender interest than the mere general bond of patriotism or humanity would supply <\s>
<s> we suppose no indifference to much less a contempt of these rewards but let them have their due place let it be ascertained when the soul is searched into that they are only an auxiliary motive to exertion never the principal or originating force <\s>
<s> if this be too much to expect from a youth who i take for granted possesses no ordinary endowments and whom circumstances with respect to the more dangerous passions have favoured then indeed must the noble spirit of the country be wasted away then would our institutions be deplorable and the education prevalent among us utterly vile and debasing <\s>

<s> i will compare then an aspiring youth leaving the schools in which he has been disciplined and preparing to bear a part in the concerns of the world i will compare him in this season of eager admiration to a newly invested knight appearing with his blank unsignalized shield upon some day of solemn tournament at the court of the faery queen as that sovereignty was conceived to exist by the moral and imaginative genius of our divine spenser <\s>

<s> in such a mixed assemblage as our age presents with its genuine merit and its large overbalance of alloy i may boldly ask into what errors either with respect to person or thing could a young man fall who had sincerely entered upon the course of moral discipline which has been recommended and to which the condition of youth it has been proved is favourable <\s>

<s> i consider the facts which you mention as indicative of what is commonly called sensibility and of quickness and talent and shall take for granted that they are so you add that the child is too much noticed by grown people and apprehend selfishness <\s>
<s> such a child will almost always be too much noticed and it is scarcely possible entirely to guard against the evil hence vanity and under bad management selfishness of the worst kind <\s>
<s> and true it is that under better and even the best management such constitutions are liable to selfishness not showing itself in the shape of tyranny caprice avarice meanness envy skulking and base self reference but selfishness of a worthier kind yet still rightly called by that name <\s>
<s> what i mean i shall explain afterwards <\s>
<s> vanity is not the necessary or even natural growth of such a temperament quite the contrary <\s>
<s> such a child if neglected and suffered to run wild would probably be entirely free from vanity owing to the liveliness of its feelings and the number of its resources <\s>
<s> it would be by nature independent and sufficient for itself <\s>
<s> but as such children in these times in particular are rarely if ever neglected or rather rarely if ever not far too much noticed it is a hundred to one your child will have more vanity than you could wish <\s>
<s> this is one evil to be guarded against <\s>
<s> formerly indeed till within these few years children were very carelessly brought up at present they too early and too habitually feel their own importance from the solicitude and unremitting attendance which is bestowed upon them <\s>
<s> a child like yours i believe unless under the wisest guidance would prosper most where she was the least noticed and the least made of i mean more than this where she received the least cultivation <\s>
<s> she does not stand in need of the stimulus of praise as much as can benefit her i e as much as her nature requires it will be impossible to withhold from her ); nor of being provoked to exertion or even if she be not injudiciously thwarted to industry <\s>
<s> nor can there be any need to be sedulous in calling out her affections her own lively enjoyments will do all this for her and also point out what is to be done to her <\s>
<s> but take all the pains you can she will be too much noticed <\s>
<s> other evils will also beset her arising more from herself and how are these to be obviated <\s>
<s> but first let us attempt to find what these evils will be <\s>
<s> observe i put all gross mismanagement out of the question and i believe they will then probably be as follows first as mentioned before a considerable portion of vanity <\s>
<s> but if the child be not constrained too much and be left sufficiently to her own pursuits and be not too anxiously tended and have not her mind planted over by art with likings that do not spring naturally up in it this will by the liveliness of her independent enjoyment almost entirely disappear and she will become modest and diffident and being not apt from the same ruling cause i mean the freshness of her own sensations to compare herself with others she will hold herself in too humble estimation <\s>
<s> but she will probably still be selfish and this brings me to the explanation of what i hinted at before viz in what manner she will be selfish <\s>
<s> it appears then to me that all the permanent evils which you have to apprehend for your daughter supposing you should live to educate her yourself may be referred to this principle an undue predominance of present objects over absent ones which as she will surely be distinguished by an extreme love of those about her will produce a certain restlessness of mind calling perpetually for proofs of ever living regard and affection she must be loved as much and in the same way as she loves or she will not be satisfied <\s>
<s> hence quickness in taking offence petty jealousies and apprehensions lest she is neglected or loses ground in people's love a want of a calm and steady sense of her own merits to secure her from these fits of imagined slights for in the first place she will as is hinted at before be in general deficient in this just estimation of her own worth and will further be apt to forget everything of that kind in the present sense of supposed injury <\s>
<s> she will all which is referable to the same cause in the company of others have too constant a craving for sympathy up to a height beyond what her companions are capable of bestowing this will often be mortifying to herself and burthensome to others and should circumstances be untoward and her mind be not sufficiently furnished with ideas and knowledge this craving would be most pernicious to herself preying upon mind and body <\s>
<s> she will be too easily pleased apt to overrate the merits of new acquaintances subject to fits of over love and over joy in absence from those she loves full of fears and apprehensions c injurious to her health her passions for the most part will be happy and good but she will be too little mistress of them <\s>
<s> the distinctions which her intellect will make will be apt able and just but in conversation she will be prone to overshoot herself and commit eloquent blunders through eagerness <\s>
<s> in fine her manners will be frank and ardent but they will want dignity and a want of dignity will be the general defect of her character <\s>
<s> something of this sort of character which i have thus loosely sketched and something of the sort of selfishness to which i have adverted it seems to me that under the best management you have reason to apprehend for your daughter <\s>
<s> if she should happen to be an only child or the only sister of brothers who would probably idolize her one might prophesy almost with absolute confidence that most of these qualities would be found in her in a great degree <\s>
<s> how then is the evil to be softened down or prevented <\s>
<s> assuredly not by mortifying her which is the course commonly pursued with such tempers nor by preaching to her about her own defects nor by overrunning her infancy with books about good boys and girls and bad boys and girls and all that trumpery but and this is the only important thing i have to say upon the subject by putting her in the way of acquiring without measure or limit such knowledge as will lead her out of herself such knowledge as is interesting for its own sake things known because they are interesting not interesting because they are known in a word by leaving her at liberty to luxuriate in such feelings and images as will feed her mind in silent pleasure <\s>
<s> this nourishment is contained in fairy tales romances the best biographies and histories and such parts of natural history relating to the powers and appearances of the earth and elements and the habits and structure of animals as belong to it not as an art or science but as a magazine of form and feeling <\s>
<s> this kind of knowledge is purely good a direct antidote to every evil to be apprehended and food absolutely necessary to preserve the mind of a child like yours from morbid appetites <\s>
<s> next to these objects comes such knowledge as while it is chiefly interesting for its own sake admits the fellowship of another sort of pleasure that of complacence from the conscious exertion of the faculties and love of praise <\s>
<s> the accomplishments of dancing music and drawing rank under this head grammar learning of languages botany probably and out of the way knowledge of arts and manufactures c <\s>
<s> the second class of objects as far as they tend to feed vanity and self conceit are evil but let them have their just proportion in the plan of education and they will afterwards contribute to destroy these by furnishing the mind with power and independent gratification the vanity will disappear and the good will remain <\s>
<s> lastly comes that class of objects which are interesting almost solely because they are known and the knowledge may be displayed and this unfortunately comprehends three fourths of what according to the plan of modern education children's heads are stuffed with that is minute remote or trifling facts in geography topography natural history chronology c or acquisitions in art or accomplishments which the child makes by rote and which are quite beyond its age things of no value in themselves but as they show cleverness things hurtful to any temper but to a child like yours absolute poison <\s>
<s> having said thus much it seems almost impertinent to add that your child above all should i might say be chained down to the severest attention to truth i mean to the minutest accuracy in every thing which she relates this will strike at the root of evil by teaching her to form correct notions of present things and will steadily strengthen her mind <\s>
<s> much caution should be taken not to damp her natural vivacity for this may have a very bad effect and by the indirect influence of the example of manly and dignified manners any excessive wildnesses of her own will be best kept under <\s>
<s> most unrelaxing firmness should from the present hour be maintained in withstanding such of her desires as are grossly unreasonable <\s>
<s> in those words it was his purpose to censure that barren contemplation which rests satisfied with itself in cases where the thoughts are of such quality that they may and ought to be embodied in action <\s>
<s> but he speaks now of the general superiority of thought to action as proceeding and governing all action that moves to salutary purposes and secondly as leading to elevation the absolute possession of the individual mind and to a consistency or harmony of the being within itself which no outward agency can reach to disturb or to impair and lastly as producing works of pure science or of the combined faculties of imagination feeling and reason works which both from their independence in their origin upon accident their nature their duration and the wide spread of their influence are entitled rightly to take place of the noblest and most beneficent deeds of heroes statesmen legislators or warriors <\s>
<s> yet beginning from the perception of this established superiority we do not suppose that the youth whom we wish to guide and encourage is to be insensible to those influences of wealth or rank or station by which the bulk of mankind are swayed <\s>
<s> our eyes have not been fixed upon virtue which lies apart from human nature or transcends it <\s>
<s> in fact there is no such virtue <\s>
<s> we neither suppose nor wish him to undervalue or slight these distinctions as modes of power things that may enable him to be more useful to his contemporaries nor as gratifications that may confer dignity upon his living person and through him upon those who love him nor as they may connect his name through a family to be founded by his success in a closer chain of gratitude with some portion of posterity who shall speak of him as among their ancestry with a more tender interest than the mere general bond of patriotism or humanity would supply <\s>
<s> we suppose no indifference to much less a contempt of these rewards but let them have their due place let it be ascertained when the soul is searched into that they are only an auxiliary motive to exertion never the principal or originating force <\s>
<s> if this be too much to expect from a youth who i take for granted possesses no ordinary endowments and whom circumstances with respect to the more dangerous passions have favoured then indeed must the noble spirit of the country be wasted away then would our institutions be deplorable and the education prevalent among us utterly vile and debasing <\s>
<s> but my correspondent who drew forth these thoughts has said rightly that the character of the age may not without injustice be thus branded <\s>
<s> he will not deny that without speaking of other countries there is in these islands in the departments of natural philosophy of mechanic ingenuity in the general activities of the country and in the particular excellence of individual minds in high stations civil or military enough to excite admiration and love in the sober minded and more than enough to intoxicate the youthful and inexperienced <\s>
<s> i will compare then an aspiring youth leaving the schools in which he has been disciplined and preparing to bear a part in the concerns of the world i will compare him in this season of eager admiration to a newly invested knight appearing with his blank unsignalized shield upon some day of solemn tournament at the court of the faery queen as that sovereignty was conceived to exist by the moral and imaginative genius of our divine spenser <\s>
<s> he does not himself immediately enter the lists as a combatant but he looks round him with a beating heart dazzled by the gorgeous pageantry the banners the impresses the ladies of overcoming beauty the persons of the knights now first seen by him the fame of whose actions is carried by the traveller like merchandize through the world and resounded upon the harp of the minstrel <\s>
<s> but i am not at liberty to make this comparison <\s>
<s> if a youth were to begin his career in such an assemblage with such examples to guide and to animate it will be pleaded there would be no cause for apprehension he could not falter he could not be misled <\s>
<s> but ours is notwithstanding its manifold excellences a degenerate age and recreant knights are among us far outnumbering the true <\s>
<s> a false gloriana in these days imposes worthless services which they who perform them in their blindness know not to be such and which are recompensed by rewards as worthless yet eagerly grasped at as if they were the immortal guerdon of virtue <\s>
<s> i have in this declaration insensibly overstepped the limits which i had determined not to pass let me be forgiven for it is hope which hath carried me forward <\s>
<s> in such a mixed assemblage as our age presents with its genuine merit and its large overbalance of alloy i may boldly ask into what errors either with respect to person or thing could a young man fall who had sincerely entered upon the course of moral discipline which has been recommended and to which the condition of youth it has been proved is favourable <\s>
<s> his opinions could no where deceive him beyond the point up to which after a season he would find that it was salutary for him to have been deceived <\s>
<s> for as that man cannot set a right value upon health who has never known sickness nor feel the blessing of ease who has been through his life a stranger to pain so can there be no confirmed and passionate love of truth for him who has not experienced the hollowness of error <\s>
<s> range against each other as advocates oppose as combatants two several intellects each strenuously asserting doctrines which he sincerely believes but the one contending for the worth and beauty of that garment which the other has outgrown and cast away <\s>
<s> mark the superiority the ease the dignity on the side of the more advanced mind how he overlooks his subject commands it from centre to circumference and hath the same thorough knowledge of the tenets which his adversary with impetuous zeal but in confusion also and thrown off his guard at every turn of the argument is labouring to maintain <\s>
<s> if it be a question of the fine arts poetry for instance the riper mind not only sees that his opponent is deceived but what is of far more importance sees how he is deceived <\s>
<s> the imagination stands before him with all its imperfections laid open as duped by shows enslaved by words corrupted by mistaken delicacy and false refinement as not having even attended with care to the reports of the senses and therefore deficient grossly in the rudiments of its own power <\s>
<s> he has noted how as a supposed necessary condition the understanding sleeps in order that the fancy may dream <\s>
<s> studied in the history of society and versed in the secret laws of thought he can pass regularly through all the gradations can pierce infallibly all the windings which false taste through ages has pursued from the very time when first through inexperience heedlessness or affectation the imagination took its departure from the side of truth its original parent <\s>
<s> can a disputant thus accoutred be withstood one to whom further every movement in the thoughts of his antagonist is revealed by the light of his own experience who therefore sympathizes with weakness gently and wins his way by forbearance and hath when needful an irresistible power of onset arising from gratitude to the truth which he vindicates not merely as a positive good for mankind but as his own especial rescue and redemption <\s>
<s> i might here conclude but my correspondent towards the close of his letter has written so feelingly upon the advantages to be derived in his estimation from a living instructor that i must not leave this part of the subject without a word of direct notice <\s>
<s> the friend cited some time ago 28 a passage from the prose works of milton eloquently describing the manner in which good and evil grow up together in the field of the world almost inseparably and insisting consequently upon the knowledge and survey of vice as necessary to the constituting of human virtue and the scanning of error to the confirmation of truth <\s>
<s> 28 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this be so and i have been reasoning to the same effect in the preceding paragraph the fact and the thoughts which it may suggest will if rightly applied tend to moderate an anxiety for the guidance of a more experienced or superior mind <\s>
<s> the advantage where it is possessed is far from being an absolute good nay such a preceptor ever at hand might prove an oppression not to be thrown off and a fatal hindrance <\s>
<s> grant that in the general tenor of his intercourse with his pupil he is forbearing and circumspect inasmuch as he is rich in that knowledge above all other necessary for a teacher which cannot exist without a liveliness of memory preserving for him an unbroken image of the winding excursive and often retrograde course along which his own intellect has passed <\s>
<s> grant that furnished with these distinct remembrances he wishes that the mind of his pupil should be free to luxuriate in the enjoyments loves and admirations appropriated to its age that he is not in haste to kill what he knows will in due time die of itself or be transmuted and put on a nobler form and higher faculties otherwise unattainable <\s>
<s> in a word that the teacher is governed habitually by the wisdom of patience waiting with pleasure <\s>
<s> yet perceiving how much the outward help of art can facilitate the progress of nature he may be betrayed into many unnecessary or pernicious mistakes where he deems his interference warranted by substantial experience <\s>
<s> and in spite of all his caution remarks may drop insensibly from him which shall wither in the mind of his pupil a generous sympathy destroy a sentiment of approbation or dislike not merely innocent but salutary and for the inexperienced disciple how many pleasures may be thus off what joy what admiration and what love <\s>
<s> while in their stead are introduced into the ingenuous mind misgivings a mistrust of its own evidence dispositions to affect to feel where there can be no real feeling indecisive judgments a superstructure of opinions that has no base to support it and words uttered by rote with the impertinence of a parrot or a mockingbird yet which may not be listened to with the same indifference as they cannot be heard without some feeling of moral disapprobation <\s>
<s> these results i contend whatever may be the benefit to be derived from such an enlightened teacher are in their degree inevitable <\s>
<s> and by this process humility and docile dispositions may exist towards the master endued as he is with the power which personal presence confers but at the same time they will be liable to overstep their due bounds and to degenerate into passiveness and prostration of mind <\s>
<s> this towards him while with respect to other living men nay even to the mighty spirits of past times there may be associated with such weakness a want of modesty and humility <\s>
<s> insensibly may steal in presumption and a habit of sitting in judgment in cases where no sentiment ought to have existed but diffidence or veneration <\s>
<s> such virtues are the sacred attributes of youth its appropriate calling is not to distinguish in the fear of being deceived or degraded not to analyze with scrupulous minuteness but to accumulate in genial confidence its instinct its safety its benefit its glory is to love to admire to feel and to labour <\s>
<s> nature has irrevocably decreed that our prime dependence in all stages of life after infancy and childhood have been passed through nor do i know that this latter ought to be excepted must be upon our own minds and that the way to knowledge shall be long difficult winding and oftentimes returning upon itself <\s>
<s> what has been said is a mere sketch and that only of a part of the interesting country into which we have been led but my correspondent will be able to enter the paths that have been pointed out <\s>
<s> should he do this and advance steadily for a while he needs not fear any deviations from the truth which will be finally injurious to him <\s>
<s> he will not long have his admiration fixed upon unworthy objects he will neither be clogged nor drawn aside by the love of friends or kindred betraying his understanding through his affections he will neither be bowed down by conventional arrangements of manners producing too often a lifeless decency nor will the rock of his spirit wear away in the endless beating of the waves of the world neither will that portion of his own time which he must surrender to labours by which his livelihood is to be earned or his social duties performed be unprofitable to himself indirectly while it is directly useful to others for that time has been primarily surrendered through an act of obedience to a moral law established by himself and therefore he moves them also along the orbit of perfect liberty <\s>
<s> let it be remembered that the advice requested does not relate to the government of the more dangerous passions or to the fundamental principles of right and wrong as acknowledged by the universal conscience of mankind <\s>
<s> i may therefore assure my youthful correspondent if he will endeavour to look into himself in the manner which i have exhorted him to do that in him the wish will be realized to him in due time the prayer granted which was uttered by that living teacher of whom he speaks with gratitude as of a benefactor when in his character of philosophical poet having thought of morality as implying in its essence voluntary obedience and producing the effect of order he transfers in the transport of imagination the law of moral to physical natures and having contemplated through the medium of that order all modes of existence as subservient to one spirit concludes his address to the power of duty in the following words to humbler functions awful power <\s>
<s> i call thee i myself commend unto thy guidance from this hour oh let my weakness have an end <\s>
<s> give unto me made lowly wise the spirit of self sacrifice the confidence of reason give and in the light of truth thy bondman let me live <\s>

<s> my dear sir i am happy to hear of the instructions which you are preparing for parents and feel honoured by your having offered to me such an opportunity of conveying to the public any information i may possess upon the subject but in truth i am so little competent in the present unarranged state of my ideas to write any thing of value that it would be the highest presumption in me to attempt it <\s>

<s> my dear sir i am happy to hear of the instructions which you are preparing for parents and feel honoured by your having offered to me such an opportunity of conveying to the public any information i may possess upon the subject but in truth i am so little competent in the present unarranged state of my ideas to write any thing of value that it would be the highest presumption in me to attempt it <\s>
<s> this is not mock modesty but rigorous and sober truth <\s>
<s> as to the case of your own child i will set down a few thoughts which i do not hope will throw much light on your mind but they will show my willingness to do the little that is in my power <\s>
<s> the child being the child of a man like you what i have to say will lie in small compass <\s>
<s> i consider the facts which you mention as indicative of what is commonly called sensibility and of quickness and talent and shall take for granted that they are so you add that the child is too much noticed by grown people and apprehend selfishness <\s>
<s> such a child will almost always be too much noticed and it is scarcely possible entirely to guard against the evil hence vanity and under bad management selfishness of the worst kind <\s>
<s> and true it is that under better and even the best management such constitutions are liable to selfishness not showing itself in the shape of tyranny caprice avarice meanness envy skulking and base self reference but selfishness of a worthier kind yet still rightly called by that name <\s>
<s> what i mean i shall explain afterwards <\s>
<s> vanity is not the necessary or even natural growth of such a temperament quite the contrary <\s>
<s> such a child if neglected and suffered to run wild would probably be entirely free from vanity owing to the liveliness of its feelings and the number of its resources <\s>
<s> it would be by nature independent and sufficient for itself <\s>
<s> but as such children in these times in particular are rarely if ever neglected or rather rarely if ever not far too much noticed it is a hundred to one your child will have more vanity than you could wish <\s>
<s> this is one evil to be guarded against <\s>
<s> formerly indeed till within these few years children were very carelessly brought up at present they too early and too habitually feel their own importance from the solicitude and unremitting attendance which is bestowed upon them <\s>
<s> a child like yours i believe unless under the wisest guidance would prosper most where she was the least noticed and the least made of i mean more than this where she received the least cultivation <\s>
<s> she does not stand in need of the stimulus of praise as much as can benefit her i e as much as her nature requires it will be impossible to withhold from her ); nor of being provoked to exertion or even if she be not injudiciously thwarted to industry <\s>
<s> nor can there be any need to be sedulous in calling out her affections her own lively enjoyments will do all this for her and also point out what is to be done to her <\s>
<s> but take all the pains you can she will be too much noticed <\s>
<s> other evils will also beset her arising more from herself and how are these to be obviated <\s>
<s> but first let us attempt to find what these evils will be <\s>
<s> observe i put all gross mismanagement out of the question and i believe they will then probably be as follows first as mentioned before a considerable portion of vanity <\s>
<s> but if the child be not constrained too much and be left sufficiently to her own pursuits and be not too anxiously tended and have not her mind planted over by art with likings that do not spring naturally up in it this will by the liveliness of her independent enjoyment almost entirely disappear and she will become modest and diffident and being not apt from the same ruling cause i mean the freshness of her own sensations to compare herself with others she will hold herself in too humble estimation <\s>
<s> but she will probably still be selfish and this brings me to the explanation of what i hinted at before viz in what manner she will be selfish <\s>
<s> it appears then to me that all the permanent evils which you have to apprehend for your daughter supposing you should live to educate her yourself may be referred to this principle an undue predominance of present objects over absent ones which as she will surely be distinguished by an extreme love of those about her will produce a certain restlessness of mind calling perpetually for proofs of ever living regard and affection she must be loved as much and in the same way as she loves or she will not be satisfied <\s>
<s> hence quickness in taking offence petty jealousies and apprehensions lest she is neglected or loses ground in people's love a want of a calm and steady sense of her own merits to secure her from these fits of imagined slights for in the first place she will as is hinted at before be in general deficient in this just estimation of her own worth and will further be apt to forget everything of that kind in the present sense of supposed injury <\s>
<s> she will all which is referable to the same cause in the company of others have too constant a craving for sympathy up to a height beyond what her companions are capable of bestowing this will often be mortifying to herself and burthensome to others and should circumstances be untoward and her mind be not sufficiently furnished with ideas and knowledge this craving would be most pernicious to herself preying upon mind and body <\s>
<s> she will be too easily pleased apt to overrate the merits of new acquaintances subject to fits of over love and over joy in absence from those she loves full of fears and apprehensions c injurious to her health her passions for the most part will be happy and good but she will be too little mistress of them <\s>
<s> the distinctions which her intellect will make will be apt able and just but in conversation she will be prone to overshoot herself and commit eloquent blunders through eagerness <\s>
<s> in fine her manners will be frank and ardent but they will want dignity and a want of dignity will be the general defect of her character <\s>
<s> something of this sort of character which i have thus loosely sketched and something of the sort of selfishness to which i have adverted it seems to me that under the best management you have reason to apprehend for your daughter <\s>
<s> if she should happen to be an only child or the only sister of brothers who would probably idolize her one might prophesy almost with absolute confidence that most of these qualities would be found in her in a great degree <\s>
<s> how then is the evil to be softened down or prevented <\s>
<s> assuredly not by mortifying her which is the course commonly pursued with such tempers nor by preaching to her about her own defects nor by overrunning her infancy with books about good boys and girls and bad boys and girls and all that trumpery but and this is the only important thing i have to say upon the subject by putting her in the way of acquiring without measure or limit such knowledge as will lead her out of herself such knowledge as is interesting for its own sake things known because they are interesting not interesting because they are known in a word by leaving her at liberty to luxuriate in such feelings and images as will feed her mind in silent pleasure <\s>
<s> this nourishment is contained in fairy tales romances the best biographies and histories and such parts of natural history relating to the powers and appearances of the earth and elements and the habits and structure of animals as belong to it not as an art or science but as a magazine of form and feeling <\s>
<s> this kind of knowledge is purely good a direct antidote to every evil to be apprehended and food absolutely necessary to preserve the mind of a child like yours from morbid appetites <\s>
<s> next to these objects comes such knowledge as while it is chiefly interesting for its own sake admits the fellowship of another sort of pleasure that of complacence from the conscious exertion of the faculties and love of praise <\s>
<s> the accomplishments of dancing music and drawing rank under this head grammar learning of languages botany probably and out of the way knowledge of arts and manufactures c <\s>
<s> the second class of objects as far as they tend to feed vanity and self conceit are evil but let them have their just proportion in the plan of education and they will afterwards contribute to destroy these by furnishing the mind with power and independent gratification the vanity will disappear and the good will remain <\s>
<s> lastly comes that class of objects which are interesting almost solely because they are known and the knowledge may be displayed and this unfortunately comprehends three fourths of what according to the plan of modern education children's heads are stuffed with that is minute remote or trifling facts in geography topography natural history chronology c or acquisitions in art or accomplishments which the child makes by rote and which are quite beyond its age things of no value in themselves but as they show cleverness things hurtful to any temper but to a child like yours absolute poison <\s>
<s> having said thus much it seems almost impertinent to add that your child above all should i might say be chained down to the severest attention to truth i mean to the minutest accuracy in every thing which she relates this will strike at the root of evil by teaching her to form correct notions of present things and will steadily strengthen her mind <\s>
<s> much caution should be taken not to damp her natural vivacity for this may have a very bad effect and by the indirect influence of the example of manly and dignified manners any excessive wildnesses of her own will be best kept under <\s>
<s> most unrelaxing firmness should from the present hour be maintained in withstanding such of her desires as are grossly unreasonable <\s>
<s> in those words it was his purpose to censure that barren contemplation which rests satisfied with itself in cases where the thoughts are of such quality that they may and ought to be embodied in action <\s>
<s> but he speaks now of the general superiority of thought to action as proceeding and governing all action that moves to salutary purposes and secondly as leading to elevation the absolute possession of the individual mind and to a consistency or harmony of the being within itself which no outward agency can reach to disturb or to impair and lastly as producing works of pure science or of the combined faculties of imagination feeling and reason works which both from their independence in their origin upon accident their nature their duration and the wide spread of their influence are entitled rightly to take place of the noblest and most beneficent deeds of heroes statesmen legislators or warriors <\s>
<s> yet beginning from the perception of this established superiority we do not suppose that the youth whom we wish to guide and encourage is to be insensible to those influences of wealth or rank or station by which the bulk of mankind are swayed <\s>
<s> our eyes have not been fixed upon virtue which lies apart from human nature or transcends it <\s>
<s> in fact there is no such virtue <\s>
<s> we neither suppose nor wish him to undervalue or slight these distinctions as modes of power things that may enable him to be more useful to his contemporaries nor as gratifications that may confer dignity upon his living person and through him upon those who love him nor as they may connect his name through a family to be founded by his success in a closer chain of gratitude with some portion of posterity who shall speak of him as among their ancestry with a more tender interest than the mere general bond of patriotism or humanity would supply <\s>
<s> we suppose no indifference to much less a contempt of these rewards but let them have their due place let it be ascertained when the soul is searched into that they are only an auxiliary motive to exertion never the principal or originating force <\s>
<s> if this be too much to expect from a youth who i take for granted possesses no ordinary endowments and whom circumstances with respect to the more dangerous passions have favoured then indeed must the noble spirit of the country be wasted away then would our institutions be deplorable and the education prevalent among us utterly vile and debasing <\s>
<s> but my correspondent who drew forth these thoughts has said rightly that the character of the age may not without injustice be thus branded <\s>
<s> he will not deny that without speaking of other countries there is in these islands in the departments of natural philosophy of mechanic ingenuity in the general activities of the country and in the particular excellence of individual minds in high stations civil or military enough to excite admiration and love in the sober minded and more than enough to intoxicate the youthful and inexperienced <\s>
<s> i will compare then an aspiring youth leaving the schools in which he has been disciplined and preparing to bear a part in the concerns of the world i will compare him in this season of eager admiration to a newly invested knight appearing with his blank unsignalized shield upon some day of solemn tournament at the court of the faery queen as that sovereignty was conceived to exist by the moral and imaginative genius of our divine spenser <\s>
<s> he does not himself immediately enter the lists as a combatant but he looks round him with a beating heart dazzled by the gorgeous pageantry the banners the impresses the ladies of overcoming beauty the persons of the knights now first seen by him the fame of whose actions is carried by the traveller like merchandize through the world and resounded upon the harp of the minstrel <\s>
<s> but i am not at liberty to make this comparison <\s>
<s> if a youth were to begin his career in such an assemblage with such examples to guide and to animate it will be pleaded there would be no cause for apprehension he could not falter he could not be misled <\s>
<s> but ours is notwithstanding its manifold excellences a degenerate age and recreant knights are among us far outnumbering the true <\s>
<s> a false gloriana in these days imposes worthless services which they who perform them in their blindness know not to be such and which are recompensed by rewards as worthless yet eagerly grasped at as if they were the immortal guerdon of virtue <\s>
<s> i have in this declaration insensibly overstepped the limits which i had determined not to pass let me be forgiven for it is hope which hath carried me forward <\s>
<s> in such a mixed assemblage as our age presents with its genuine merit and its large overbalance of alloy i may boldly ask into what errors either with respect to person or thing could a young man fall who had sincerely entered upon the course of moral discipline which has been recommended and to which the condition of youth it has been proved is favourable <\s>
<s> his opinions could no where deceive him beyond the point up to which after a season he would find that it was salutary for him to have been deceived <\s>
<s> for as that man cannot set a right value upon health who has never known sickness nor feel the blessing of ease who has been through his life a stranger to pain so can there be no confirmed and passionate love of truth for him who has not experienced the hollowness of error <\s>
<s> range against each other as advocates oppose as combatants two several intellects each strenuously asserting doctrines which he sincerely believes but the one contending for the worth and beauty of that garment which the other has outgrown and cast away <\s>
<s> mark the superiority the ease the dignity on the side of the more advanced mind how he overlooks his subject commands it from centre to circumference and hath the same thorough knowledge of the tenets which his adversary with impetuous zeal but in confusion also and thrown off his guard at every turn of the argument is labouring to maintain <\s>
<s> if it be a question of the fine arts poetry for instance the riper mind not only sees that his opponent is deceived but what is of far more importance sees how he is deceived <\s>
<s> the imagination stands before him with all its imperfections laid open as duped by shows enslaved by words corrupted by mistaken delicacy and false refinement as not having even attended with care to the reports of the senses and therefore deficient grossly in the rudiments of its own power <\s>

<s> can a disputant thus accoutred be withstood one to whom further every movement in the thoughts of his antagonist is revealed by the light of his own experience who therefore sympathizes with weakness gently and wins his way by forbearance and hath when needful an irresistible power of onset arising from gratitude to the truth which he vindicates not merely as a positive good for mankind but as his own especial rescue and redemption <\s>
<s> i might here conclude but my correspondent towards the close of his letter has written so feelingly upon the advantages to be derived in his estimation from a living instructor that i must not leave this part of the subject without a word of direct notice <\s>

<s> letter to a friend 1806 <\s>
<s> my dear sir i am happy to hear of the instructions which you are preparing for parents and feel honoured by your having offered to me such an opportunity of conveying to the public any information i may possess upon the subject but in truth i am so little competent in the present unarranged state of my ideas to write any thing of value that it would be the highest presumption in me to attempt it <\s>
<s> this is not mock modesty but rigorous and sober truth <\s>
<s> as to the case of your own child i will set down a few thoughts which i do not hope will throw much light on your mind but they will show my willingness to do the little that is in my power <\s>
<s> the child being the child of a man like you what i have to say will lie in small compass <\s>
<s> i consider the facts which you mention as indicative of what is commonly called sensibility and of quickness and talent and shall take for granted that they are so you add that the child is too much noticed by grown people and apprehend selfishness <\s>
<s> such a child will almost always be too much noticed and it is scarcely possible entirely to guard against the evil hence vanity and under bad management selfishness of the worst kind <\s>
<s> and true it is that under better and even the best management such constitutions are liable to selfishness not showing itself in the shape of tyranny caprice avarice meanness envy skulking and base self reference but selfishness of a worthier kind yet still rightly called by that name <\s>
<s> what i mean i shall explain afterwards <\s>
<s> vanity is not the necessary or even natural growth of such a temperament quite the contrary <\s>
<s> such a child if neglected and suffered to run wild would probably be entirely free from vanity owing to the liveliness of its feelings and the number of its resources <\s>
<s> it would be by nature independent and sufficient for itself <\s>
<s> but as such children in these times in particular are rarely if ever neglected or rather rarely if ever not far too much noticed it is a hundred to one your child will have more vanity than you could wish <\s>
<s> this is one evil to be guarded against <\s>
<s> formerly indeed till within these few years children were very carelessly brought up at present they too early and too habitually feel their own importance from the solicitude and unremitting attendance which is bestowed upon them <\s>
<s> a child like yours i believe unless under the wisest guidance would prosper most where she was the least noticed and the least made of i mean more than this where she received the least cultivation <\s>
<s> she does not stand in need of the stimulus of praise as much as can benefit her i e as much as her nature requires it will be impossible to withhold from her ); nor of being provoked to exertion or even if she be not injudiciously thwarted to industry <\s>
<s> nor can there be any need to be sedulous in calling out her affections her own lively enjoyments will do all this for her and also point out what is to be done to her <\s>
<s> but take all the pains you can she will be too much noticed <\s>
<s> other evils will also beset her arising more from herself and how are these to be obviated <\s>
<s> but first let us attempt to find what these evils will be <\s>
<s> observe i put all gross mismanagement out of the question and i believe they will then probably be as follows first as mentioned before a considerable portion of vanity <\s>
<s> but if the child be not constrained too much and be left sufficiently to her own pursuits and be not too anxiously tended and have not her mind planted over by art with likings that do not spring naturally up in it this will by the liveliness of her independent enjoyment almost entirely disappear and she will become modest and diffident and being not apt from the same ruling cause i mean the freshness of her own sensations to compare herself with others she will hold herself in too humble estimation <\s>
<s> but she will probably still be selfish and this brings me to the explanation of what i hinted at before viz in what manner she will be selfish <\s>
<s> it appears then to me that all the permanent evils which you have to apprehend for your daughter supposing you should live to educate her yourself may be referred to this principle an undue predominance of present objects over absent ones which as she will surely be distinguished by an extreme love of those about her will produce a certain restlessness of mind calling perpetually for proofs of ever living regard and affection she must be loved as much and in the same way as she loves or she will not be satisfied <\s>
<s> hence quickness in taking offence petty jealousies and apprehensions lest she is neglected or loses ground in people's love a want of a calm and steady sense of her own merits to secure her from these fits of imagined slights for in the first place she will as is hinted at before be in general deficient in this just estimation of her own worth and will further be apt to forget everything of that kind in the present sense of supposed injury <\s>
<s> she will all which is referable to the same cause in the company of others have too constant a craving for sympathy up to a height beyond what her companions are capable of bestowing this will often be mortifying to herself and burthensome to others and should circumstances be untoward and her mind be not sufficiently furnished with ideas and knowledge this craving would be most pernicious to herself preying upon mind and body <\s>
<s> she will be too easily pleased apt to overrate the merits of new acquaintances subject to fits of over love and over joy in absence from those she loves full of fears and apprehensions c injurious to her health her passions for the most part will be happy and good but she will be too little mistress of them <\s>
<s> the distinctions which her intellect will make will be apt able and just but in conversation she will be prone to overshoot herself and commit eloquent blunders through eagerness <\s>
<s> in fine her manners will be frank and ardent but they will want dignity and a want of dignity will be the general defect of her character <\s>
<s> something of this sort of character which i have thus loosely sketched and something of the sort of selfishness to which i have adverted it seems to me that under the best management you have reason to apprehend for your daughter <\s>
<s> if she should happen to be an only child or the only sister of brothers who would probably idolize her one might prophesy almost with absolute confidence that most of these qualities would be found in her in a great degree <\s>
<s> how then is the evil to be softened down or prevented <\s>
<s> assuredly not by mortifying her which is the course commonly pursued with such tempers nor by preaching to her about her own defects nor by overrunning her infancy with books about good boys and girls and bad boys and girls and all that trumpery but and this is the only important thing i have to say upon the subject by putting her in the way of acquiring without measure or limit such knowledge as will lead her out of herself such knowledge as is interesting for its own sake things known because they are interesting not interesting because they are known in a word by leaving her at liberty to luxuriate in such feelings and images as will feed her mind in silent pleasure <\s>
<s> this nourishment is contained in fairy tales romances the best biographies and histories and such parts of natural history relating to the powers and appearances of the earth and elements and the habits and structure of animals as belong to it not as an art or science but as a magazine of form and feeling <\s>
<s> this kind of knowledge is purely good a direct antidote to every evil to be apprehended and food absolutely necessary to preserve the mind of a child like yours from morbid appetites <\s>
<s> next to these objects comes such knowledge as while it is chiefly interesting for its own sake admits the fellowship of another sort of pleasure that of complacence from the conscious exertion of the faculties and love of praise <\s>
<s> the accomplishments of dancing music and drawing rank under this head grammar learning of languages botany probably and out of the way knowledge of arts and manufactures c <\s>
<s> the second class of objects as far as they tend to feed vanity and self conceit are evil but let them have their just proportion in the plan of education and they will afterwards contribute to destroy these by furnishing the mind with power and independent gratification the vanity will disappear and the good will remain <\s>

<s> having said thus much it seems almost impertinent to add that your child above all should i might say be chained down to the severest attention to truth i mean to the minutest accuracy in every thing which she relates this will strike at the root of evil by teaching her to form correct notions of present things and will steadily strengthen her mind <\s>
<s> much caution should be taken not to damp her natural vivacity for this may have a very bad effect and by the indirect influence of the example of manly and dignified manners any excessive wildnesses of her own will be best kept under <\s>
<s> most unrelaxing firmness should from the present hour be maintained in withstanding such of her desires as are grossly unreasonable <\s>

<s> my dear sir i am happy to hear of the instructions which you are preparing for parents and feel honoured by your having offered to me such an opportunity of conveying to the public any information i may possess upon the subject but in truth i am so little competent in the present unarranged state of my ideas to write any thing of value that it would be the highest presumption in me to attempt it <\s>
<s> this is not mock modesty but rigorous and sober truth <\s>
<s> as to the case of your own child i will set down a few thoughts which i do not hope will throw much light on your mind but they will show my willingness to do the little that is in my power <\s>
<s> the child being the child of a man like you what i have to say will lie in small compass <\s>
<s> i consider the facts which you mention as indicative of what is commonly called sensibility and of quickness and talent and shall take for granted that they are so you add that the child is too much noticed by grown people and apprehend selfishness <\s>
<s> such a child will almost always be too much noticed and it is scarcely possible entirely to guard against the evil hence vanity and under bad management selfishness of the worst kind <\s>
<s> and true it is that under better and even the best management such constitutions are liable to selfishness not showing itself in the shape of tyranny caprice avarice meanness envy skulking and base self reference but selfishness of a worthier kind yet still rightly called by that name <\s>
<s> what i mean i shall explain afterwards <\s>
<s> vanity is not the necessary or even natural growth of such a temperament quite the contrary <\s>
<s> such a child if neglected and suffered to run wild would probably be entirely free from vanity owing to the liveliness of its feelings and the number of its resources <\s>
<s> it would be by nature independent and sufficient for itself <\s>
<s> but as such children in these times in particular are rarely if ever neglected or rather rarely if ever not far too much noticed it is a hundred to one your child will have more vanity than you could wish <\s>
<s> this is one evil to be guarded against <\s>
<s> formerly indeed till within these few years children were very carelessly brought up at present they too early and too habitually feel their own importance from the solicitude and unremitting attendance which is bestowed upon them <\s>
<s> a child like yours i believe unless under the wisest guidance would prosper most where she was the least noticed and the least made of i mean more than this where she received the least cultivation <\s>
<s> she does not stand in need of the stimulus of praise as much as can benefit her i e as much as her nature requires it will be impossible to withhold from her ); nor of being provoked to exertion or even if she be not injudiciously thwarted to industry <\s>
<s> nor can there be any need to be sedulous in calling out her affections her own lively enjoyments will do all this for her and also point out what is to be done to her <\s>
<s> but take all the pains you can she will be too much noticed <\s>
<s> other evils will also beset her arising more from herself and how are these to be obviated <\s>
<s> but first let us attempt to find what these evils will be <\s>
<s> observe i put all gross mismanagement out of the question and i believe they will then probably be as follows first as mentioned before a considerable portion of vanity <\s>
<s> but if the child be not constrained too much and be left sufficiently to her own pursuits and be not too anxiously tended and have not her mind planted over by art with likings that do not spring naturally up in it this will by the liveliness of her independent enjoyment almost entirely disappear and she will become modest and diffident and being not apt from the same ruling cause i mean the freshness of her own sensations to compare herself with others she will hold herself in too humble estimation <\s>
<s> but she will probably still be selfish and this brings me to the explanation of what i hinted at before viz in what manner she will be selfish <\s>
<s> it appears then to me that all the permanent evils which you have to apprehend for your daughter supposing you should live to educate her yourself may be referred to this principle an undue predominance of present objects over absent ones which as she will surely be distinguished by an extreme love of those about her will produce a certain restlessness of mind calling perpetually for proofs of ever living regard and affection she must be loved as much and in the same way as she loves or she will not be satisfied <\s>
<s> hence quickness in taking offence petty jealousies and apprehensions lest she is neglected or loses ground in people's love a want of a calm and steady sense of her own merits to secure her from these fits of imagined slights for in the first place she will as is hinted at before be in general deficient in this just estimation of her own worth and will further be apt to forget everything of that kind in the present sense of supposed injury <\s>
<s> she will all which is referable to the same cause in the company of others have too constant a craving for sympathy up to a height beyond what her companions are capable of bestowing this will often be mortifying to herself and burthensome to others and should circumstances be untoward and her mind be not sufficiently furnished with ideas and knowledge this craving would be most pernicious to herself preying upon mind and body <\s>
<s> she will be too easily pleased apt to overrate the merits of new acquaintances subject to fits of over love and over joy in absence from those she loves full of fears and apprehensions c injurious to her health her passions for the most part will be happy and good but she will be too little mistress of them <\s>
<s> the distinctions which her intellect will make will be apt able and just but in conversation she will be prone to overshoot herself and commit eloquent blunders through eagerness <\s>
<s> in fine her manners will be frank and ardent but they will want dignity and a want of dignity will be the general defect of her character <\s>
<s> something of this sort of character which i have thus loosely sketched and something of the sort of selfishness to which i have adverted it seems to me that under the best management you have reason to apprehend for your daughter <\s>
<s> if she should happen to be an only child or the only sister of brothers who would probably idolize her one might prophesy almost with absolute confidence that most of these qualities would be found in her in a great degree <\s>
<s> how then is the evil to be softened down or prevented <\s>
<s> assuredly not by mortifying her which is the course commonly pursued with such tempers nor by preaching to her about her own defects nor by overrunning her infancy with books about good boys and girls and bad boys and girls and all that trumpery but and this is the only important thing i have to say upon the subject by putting her in the way of acquiring without measure or limit such knowledge as will lead her out of herself such knowledge as is interesting for its own sake things known because they are interesting not interesting because they are known in a word by leaving her at liberty to luxuriate in such feelings and images as will feed her mind in silent pleasure <\s>
<s> this nourishment is contained in fairy tales romances the best biographies and histories and such parts of natural history relating to the powers and appearances of the earth and elements and the habits and structure of animals as belong to it not as an art or science but as a magazine of form and feeling <\s>
<s> this kind of knowledge is purely good a direct antidote to every evil to be apprehended and food absolutely necessary to preserve the mind of a child like yours from morbid appetites <\s>
<s> next to these objects comes such knowledge as while it is chiefly interesting for its own sake admits the fellowship of another sort of pleasure that of complacence from the conscious exertion of the faculties and love of praise <\s>
<s> the accomplishments of dancing music and drawing rank under this head grammar learning of languages botany probably and out of the way knowledge of arts and manufactures c <\s>
<s> the second class of objects as far as they tend to feed vanity and self conceit are evil but let them have their just proportion in the plan of education and they will afterwards contribute to destroy these by furnishing the mind with power and independent gratification the vanity will disappear and the good will remain <\s>
<s> lastly comes that class of objects which are interesting almost solely because they are known and the knowledge may be displayed and this unfortunately comprehends three fourths of what according to the plan of modern education children's heads are stuffed with that is minute remote or trifling facts in geography topography natural history chronology c or acquisitions in art or accomplishments which the child makes by rote and which are quite beyond its age things of no value in themselves but as they show cleverness things hurtful to any temper but to a child like yours absolute poison <\s>
<s> having said thus much it seems almost impertinent to add that your child above all should i might say be chained down to the severest attention to truth i mean to the minutest accuracy in every thing which she relates this will strike at the root of evil by teaching her to form correct notions of present things and will steadily strengthen her mind <\s>
<s> much caution should be taken not to damp her natural vivacity for this may have a very bad effect and by the indirect influence of the example of manly and dignified manners any excessive wildnesses of her own will be best kept under <\s>
<s> most unrelaxing firmness should from the present hour be maintained in withstanding such of her desires as are grossly unreasonable <\s>
<s> in those words it was his purpose to censure that barren contemplation which rests satisfied with itself in cases where the thoughts are of such quality that they may and ought to be embodied in action <\s>
<s> but he speaks now of the general superiority of thought to action as proceeding and governing all action that moves to salutary purposes and secondly as leading to elevation the absolute possession of the individual mind and to a consistency or harmony of the being within itself which no outward agency can reach to disturb or to impair and lastly as producing works of pure science or of the combined faculties of imagination feeling and reason works which both from their independence in their origin upon accident their nature their duration and the wide spread of their influence are entitled rightly to take place of the noblest and most beneficent deeds of heroes statesmen legislators or warriors <\s>
<s> yet beginning from the perception of this established superiority we do not suppose that the youth whom we wish to guide and encourage is to be insensible to those influences of wealth or rank or station by which the bulk of mankind are swayed <\s>
<s> our eyes have not been fixed upon virtue which lies apart from human nature or transcends it <\s>
<s> in fact there is no such virtue <\s>
<s> we neither suppose nor wish him to undervalue or slight these distinctions as modes of power things that may enable him to be more useful to his contemporaries nor as gratifications that may confer dignity upon his living person and through him upon those who love him nor as they may connect his name through a family to be founded by his success in a closer chain of gratitude with some portion of posterity who shall speak of him as among their ancestry with a more tender interest than the mere general bond of patriotism or humanity would supply <\s>
<s> we suppose no indifference to much less a contempt of these rewards but let them have their due place let it be ascertained when the soul is searched into that they are only an auxiliary motive to exertion never the principal or originating force <\s>
<s> if this be too much to expect from a youth who i take for granted possesses no ordinary endowments and whom circumstances with respect to the more dangerous passions have favoured then indeed must the noble spirit of the country be wasted away then would our institutions be deplorable and the education prevalent among us utterly vile and debasing <\s>
<s> but my correspondent who drew forth these thoughts has said rightly that the character of the age may not without injustice be thus branded <\s>
<s> he will not deny that without speaking of other countries there is in these islands in the departments of natural philosophy of mechanic ingenuity in the general activities of the country and in the particular excellence of individual minds in high stations civil or military enough to excite admiration and love in the sober minded and more than enough to intoxicate the youthful and inexperienced <\s>
<s> i will compare then an aspiring youth leaving the schools in which he has been disciplined and preparing to bear a part in the concerns of the world i will compare him in this season of eager admiration to a newly invested knight appearing with his blank unsignalized shield upon some day of solemn tournament at the court of the faery queen as that sovereignty was conceived to exist by the moral and imaginative genius of our divine spenser <\s>
<s> he does not himself immediately enter the lists as a combatant but he looks round him with a beating heart dazzled by the gorgeous pageantry the banners the impresses the ladies of overcoming beauty the persons of the knights now first seen by him the fame of whose actions is carried by the traveller like merchandize through the world and resounded upon the harp of the minstrel <\s>
<s> but i am not at liberty to make this comparison <\s>
<s> if a youth were to begin his career in such an assemblage with such examples to guide and to animate it will be pleaded there would be no cause for apprehension he could not falter he could not be misled <\s>
<s> but ours is notwithstanding its manifold excellences a degenerate age and recreant knights are among us far outnumbering the true <\s>
<s> a false gloriana in these days imposes worthless services which they who perform them in their blindness know not to be such and which are recompensed by rewards as worthless yet eagerly grasped at as if they were the immortal guerdon of virtue <\s>
<s> i have in this declaration insensibly overstepped the limits which i had determined not to pass let me be forgiven for it is hope which hath carried me forward <\s>
<s> in such a mixed assemblage as our age presents with its genuine merit and its large overbalance of alloy i may boldly ask into what errors either with respect to person or thing could a young man fall who had sincerely entered upon the course of moral discipline which has been recommended and to which the condition of youth it has been proved is favourable <\s>
<s> his opinions could no where deceive him beyond the point up to which after a season he would find that it was salutary for him to have been deceived <\s>
<s> for as that man cannot set a right value upon health who has never known sickness nor feel the blessing of ease who has been through his life a stranger to pain so can there be no confirmed and passionate love of truth for him who has not experienced the hollowness of error <\s>
<s> range against each other as advocates oppose as combatants two several intellects each strenuously asserting doctrines which he sincerely believes but the one contending for the worth and beauty of that garment which the other has outgrown and cast away <\s>
<s> mark the superiority the ease the dignity on the side of the more advanced mind how he overlooks his subject commands it from centre to circumference and hath the same thorough knowledge of the tenets which his adversary with impetuous zeal but in confusion also and thrown off his guard at every turn of the argument is labouring to maintain <\s>
<s> if it be a question of the fine arts poetry for instance the riper mind not only sees that his opponent is deceived but what is of far more importance sees how he is deceived <\s>
<s> the imagination stands before him with all its imperfections laid open as duped by shows enslaved by words corrupted by mistaken delicacy and false refinement as not having even attended with care to the reports of the senses and therefore deficient grossly in the rudiments of its own power <\s>
<s> he has noted how as a supposed necessary condition the understanding sleeps in order that the fancy may dream <\s>
<s> studied in the history of society and versed in the secret laws of thought he can pass regularly through all the gradations can pierce infallibly all the windings which false taste through ages has pursued from the very time when first through inexperience heedlessness or affectation the imagination took its departure from the side of truth its original parent <\s>
<s> can a disputant thus accoutred be withstood one to whom further every movement in the thoughts of his antagonist is revealed by the light of his own experience who therefore sympathizes with weakness gently and wins his way by forbearance and hath when needful an irresistible power of onset arising from gratitude to the truth which he vindicates not merely as a positive good for mankind but as his own especial rescue and redemption <\s>
<s> i might here conclude but my correspondent towards the close of his letter has written so feelingly upon the advantages to be derived in his estimation from a living instructor that i must not leave this part of the subject without a word of direct notice <\s>
<s> the friend cited some time ago 28 a passage from the prose works of milton eloquently describing the manner in which good and evil grow up together in the field of the world almost inseparably and insisting consequently upon the knowledge and survey of vice as necessary to the constituting of human virtue and the scanning of error to the confirmation of truth <\s>
<s> 28 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this be so and i have been reasoning to the same effect in the preceding paragraph the fact and the thoughts which it may suggest will if rightly applied tend to moderate an anxiety for the guidance of a more experienced or superior mind <\s>
<s> the advantage where it is possessed is far from being an absolute good nay such a preceptor ever at hand might prove an oppression not to be thrown off and a fatal hindrance <\s>
<s> grant that in the general tenor of his intercourse with his pupil he is forbearing and circumspect inasmuch as he is rich in that knowledge above all other necessary for a teacher which cannot exist without a liveliness of memory preserving for him an unbroken image of the winding excursive and often retrograde course along which his own intellect has passed <\s>
<s> grant that furnished with these distinct remembrances he wishes that the mind of his pupil should be free to luxuriate in the enjoyments loves and admirations appropriated to its age that he is not in haste to kill what he knows will in due time die of itself or be transmuted and put on a nobler form and higher faculties otherwise unattainable <\s>
<s> in a word that the teacher is governed habitually by the wisdom of patience waiting with pleasure <\s>
<s> yet perceiving how much the outward help of art can facilitate the progress of nature he may be betrayed into many unnecessary or pernicious mistakes where he deems his interference warranted by substantial experience <\s>
<s> and in spite of all his caution remarks may drop insensibly from him which shall wither in the mind of his pupil a generous sympathy destroy a sentiment of approbation or dislike not merely innocent but salutary and for the inexperienced disciple how many pleasures may be thus off what joy what admiration and what love <\s>
<s> while in their stead are introduced into the ingenuous mind misgivings a mistrust of its own evidence dispositions to affect to feel where there can be no real feeling indecisive judgments a superstructure of opinions that has no base to support it and words uttered by rote with the impertinence of a parrot or a mockingbird yet which may not be listened to with the same indifference as they cannot be heard without some feeling of moral disapprobation <\s>
<s> these results i contend whatever may be the benefit to be derived from such an enlightened teacher are in their degree inevitable <\s>
<s> and by this process humility and docile dispositions may exist towards the master endued as he is with the power which personal presence confers but at the same time they will be liable to overstep their due bounds and to degenerate into passiveness and prostration of mind <\s>
<s> this towards him while with respect to other living men nay even to the mighty spirits of past times there may be associated with such weakness a want of modesty and humility <\s>
<s> insensibly may steal in presumption and a habit of sitting in judgment in cases where no sentiment ought to have existed but diffidence or veneration <\s>
<s> such virtues are the sacred attributes of youth its appropriate calling is not to distinguish in the fear of being deceived or degraded not to analyze with scrupulous minuteness but to accumulate in genial confidence its instinct its safety its benefit its glory is to love to admire to feel and to labour <\s>
<s> nature has irrevocably decreed that our prime dependence in all stages of life after infancy and childhood have been passed through nor do i know that this latter ought to be excepted must be upon our own minds and that the way to knowledge shall be long difficult winding and oftentimes returning upon itself <\s>

<s> my dear sir i am happy to hear of the instructions which you are preparing for parents and feel honoured by your having offered to me such an opportunity of conveying to the public any information i may possess upon the subject but in truth i am so little competent in the present unarranged state of my ideas to write any thing of value that it would be the highest presumption in me to attempt it <\s>
<s> this is not mock modesty but rigorous and sober truth <\s>
<s> as to the case of your own child i will set down a few thoughts which i do not hope will throw much light on your mind but they will show my willingness to do the little that is in my power <\s>
<s> the child being the child of a man like you what i have to say will lie in small compass <\s>
<s> i consider the facts which you mention as indicative of what is commonly called sensibility and of quickness and talent and shall take for granted that they are so you add that the child is too much noticed by grown people and apprehend selfishness <\s>
<s> such a child will almost always be too much noticed and it is scarcely possible entirely to guard against the evil hence vanity and under bad management selfishness of the worst kind <\s>
<s> and true it is that under better and even the best management such constitutions are liable to selfishness not showing itself in the shape of tyranny caprice avarice meanness envy skulking and base self reference but selfishness of a worthier kind yet still rightly called by that name <\s>
<s> what i mean i shall explain afterwards <\s>
<s> vanity is not the necessary or even natural growth of such a temperament quite the contrary <\s>
<s> such a child if neglected and suffered to run wild would probably be entirely free from vanity owing to the liveliness of its feelings and the number of its resources <\s>
<s> it would be by nature independent and sufficient for itself <\s>
<s> but as such children in these times in particular are rarely if ever neglected or rather rarely if ever not far too much noticed it is a hundred to one your child will have more vanity than you could wish <\s>
<s> this is one evil to be guarded against <\s>
<s> formerly indeed till within these few years children were very carelessly brought up at present they too early and too habitually feel their own importance from the solicitude and unremitting attendance which is bestowed upon them <\s>
<s> a child like yours i believe unless under the wisest guidance would prosper most where she was the least noticed and the least made of i mean more than this where she received the least cultivation <\s>
<s> she does not stand in need of the stimulus of praise as much as can benefit her i e as much as her nature requires it will be impossible to withhold from her ); nor of being provoked to exertion or even if she be not injudiciously thwarted to industry <\s>
<s> nor can there be any need to be sedulous in calling out her affections her own lively enjoyments will do all this for her and also point out what is to be done to her <\s>
<s> but take all the pains you can she will be too much noticed <\s>
<s> other evils will also beset her arising more from herself and how are these to be obviated <\s>
<s> but first let us attempt to find what these evils will be <\s>
<s> observe i put all gross mismanagement out of the question and i believe they will then probably be as follows first as mentioned before a considerable portion of vanity <\s>
<s> but if the child be not constrained too much and be left sufficiently to her own pursuits and be not too anxiously tended and have not her mind planted over by art with likings that do not spring naturally up in it this will by the liveliness of her independent enjoyment almost entirely disappear and she will become modest and diffident and being not apt from the same ruling cause i mean the freshness of her own sensations to compare herself with others she will hold herself in too humble estimation <\s>
<s> but she will probably still be selfish and this brings me to the explanation of what i hinted at before viz in what manner she will be selfish <\s>
<s> it appears then to me that all the permanent evils which you have to apprehend for your daughter supposing you should live to educate her yourself may be referred to this principle an undue predominance of present objects over absent ones which as she will surely be distinguished by an extreme love of those about her will produce a certain restlessness of mind calling perpetually for proofs of ever living regard and affection she must be loved as much and in the same way as she loves or she will not be satisfied <\s>
<s> hence quickness in taking offence petty jealousies and apprehensions lest she is neglected or loses ground in people's love a want of a calm and steady sense of her own merits to secure her from these fits of imagined slights for in the first place she will as is hinted at before be in general deficient in this just estimation of her own worth and will further be apt to forget everything of that kind in the present sense of supposed injury <\s>
<s> she will all which is referable to the same cause in the company of others have too constant a craving for sympathy up to a height beyond what her companions are capable of bestowing this will often be mortifying to herself and burthensome to others and should circumstances be untoward and her mind be not sufficiently furnished with ideas and knowledge this craving would be most pernicious to herself preying upon mind and body <\s>
<s> she will be too easily pleased apt to overrate the merits of new acquaintances subject to fits of over love and over joy in absence from those she loves full of fears and apprehensions c injurious to her health her passions for the most part will be happy and good but she will be too little mistress of them <\s>
<s> the distinctions which her intellect will make will be apt able and just but in conversation she will be prone to overshoot herself and commit eloquent blunders through eagerness <\s>
<s> in fine her manners will be frank and ardent but they will want dignity and a want of dignity will be the general defect of her character <\s>
<s> something of this sort of character which i have thus loosely sketched and something of the sort of selfishness to which i have adverted it seems to me that under the best management you have reason to apprehend for your daughter <\s>
<s> if she should happen to be an only child or the only sister of brothers who would probably idolize her one might prophesy almost with absolute confidence that most of these qualities would be found in her in a great degree <\s>
<s> how then is the evil to be softened down or prevented <\s>
<s> assuredly not by mortifying her which is the course commonly pursued with such tempers nor by preaching to her about her own defects nor by overrunning her infancy with books about good boys and girls and bad boys and girls and all that trumpery but and this is the only important thing i have to say upon the subject by putting her in the way of acquiring without measure or limit such knowledge as will lead her out of herself such knowledge as is interesting for its own sake things known because they are interesting not interesting because they are known in a word by leaving her at liberty to luxuriate in such feelings and images as will feed her mind in silent pleasure <\s>
<s> this nourishment is contained in fairy tales romances the best biographies and histories and such parts of natural history relating to the powers and appearances of the earth and elements and the habits and structure of animals as belong to it not as an art or science but as a magazine of form and feeling <\s>
<s> this kind of knowledge is purely good a direct antidote to every evil to be apprehended and food absolutely necessary to preserve the mind of a child like yours from morbid appetites <\s>
<s> next to these objects comes such knowledge as while it is chiefly interesting for its own sake admits the fellowship of another sort of pleasure that of complacence from the conscious exertion of the faculties and love of praise <\s>
<s> the accomplishments of dancing music and drawing rank under this head grammar learning of languages botany probably and out of the way knowledge of arts and manufactures c <\s>
<s> the second class of objects as far as they tend to feed vanity and self conceit are evil but let them have their just proportion in the plan of education and they will afterwards contribute to destroy these by furnishing the mind with power and independent gratification the vanity will disappear and the good will remain <\s>
<s> lastly comes that class of objects which are interesting almost solely because they are known and the knowledge may be displayed and this unfortunately comprehends three fourths of what according to the plan of modern education children's heads are stuffed with that is minute remote or trifling facts in geography topography natural history chronology c or acquisitions in art or accomplishments which the child makes by rote and which are quite beyond its age things of no value in themselves but as they show cleverness things hurtful to any temper but to a child like yours absolute poison <\s>
<s> having said thus much it seems almost impertinent to add that your child above all should i might say be chained down to the severest attention to truth i mean to the minutest accuracy in every thing which she relates this will strike at the root of evil by teaching her to form correct notions of present things and will steadily strengthen her mind <\s>
<s> much caution should be taken not to damp her natural vivacity for this may have a very bad effect and by the indirect influence of the example of manly and dignified manners any excessive wildnesses of her own will be best kept under <\s>
<s> most unrelaxing firmness should from the present hour be maintained in withstanding such of her desires as are grossly unreasonable <\s>
<s> in those words it was his purpose to censure that barren contemplation which rests satisfied with itself in cases where the thoughts are of such quality that they may and ought to be embodied in action <\s>
<s> but he speaks now of the general superiority of thought to action as proceeding and governing all action that moves to salutary purposes and secondly as leading to elevation the absolute possession of the individual mind and to a consistency or harmony of the being within itself which no outward agency can reach to disturb or to impair and lastly as producing works of pure science or of the combined faculties of imagination feeling and reason works which both from their independence in their origin upon accident their nature their duration and the wide spread of their influence are entitled rightly to take place of the noblest and most beneficent deeds of heroes statesmen legislators or warriors <\s>
<s> yet beginning from the perception of this established superiority we do not suppose that the youth whom we wish to guide and encourage is to be insensible to those influences of wealth or rank or station by which the bulk of mankind are swayed <\s>
<s> our eyes have not been fixed upon virtue which lies apart from human nature or transcends it <\s>
<s> in fact there is no such virtue <\s>
<s> we neither suppose nor wish him to undervalue or slight these distinctions as modes of power things that may enable him to be more useful to his contemporaries nor as gratifications that may confer dignity upon his living person and through him upon those who love him nor as they may connect his name through a family to be founded by his success in a closer chain of gratitude with some portion of posterity who shall speak of him as among their ancestry with a more tender interest than the mere general bond of patriotism or humanity would supply <\s>
<s> we suppose no indifference to much less a contempt of these rewards but let them have their due place let it be ascertained when the soul is searched into that they are only an auxiliary motive to exertion never the principal or originating force <\s>
<s> if this be too much to expect from a youth who i take for granted possesses no ordinary endowments and whom circumstances with respect to the more dangerous passions have favoured then indeed must the noble spirit of the country be wasted away then would our institutions be deplorable and the education prevalent among us utterly vile and debasing <\s>

<s> i will compare then an aspiring youth leaving the schools in which he has been disciplined and preparing to bear a part in the concerns of the world i will compare him in this season of eager admiration to a newly invested knight appearing with his blank unsignalized shield upon some day of solemn tournament at the court of the faery queen as that sovereignty was conceived to exist by the moral and imaginative genius of our divine spenser <\s>

<s> in such a mixed assemblage as our age presents with its genuine merit and its large overbalance of alloy i may boldly ask into what errors either with respect to person or thing could a young man fall who had sincerely entered upon the course of moral discipline which has been recommended and to which the condition of youth it has been proved is favourable <\s>

<s> such a child will almost always be too much noticed and it is scarcely possible entirely to guard against the evil hence vanity and under bad management selfishness of the worst kind <\s>
<s> and true it is that under better and even the best management such constitutions are liable to selfishness not showing itself in the shape of tyranny caprice avarice meanness envy skulking and base self reference but selfishness of a worthier kind yet still rightly called by that name <\s>
<s> what i mean i shall explain afterwards <\s>
<s> vanity is not the necessary or even natural growth of such a temperament quite the contrary <\s>
<s> such a child if neglected and suffered to run wild would probably be entirely free from vanity owing to the liveliness of its feelings and the number of its resources <\s>
<s> it would be by nature independent and sufficient for itself <\s>
<s> but as such children in these times in particular are rarely if ever neglected or rather rarely if ever not far too much noticed it is a hundred to one your child will have more vanity than you could wish <\s>
<s> this is one evil to be guarded against <\s>
<s> formerly indeed till within these few years children were very carelessly brought up at present they too early and too habitually feel their own importance from the solicitude and unremitting attendance which is bestowed upon them <\s>
<s> a child like yours i believe unless under the wisest guidance would prosper most where she was the least noticed and the least made of i mean more than this where she received the least cultivation <\s>
<s> she does not stand in need of the stimulus of praise as much as can benefit her i e as much as her nature requires it will be impossible to withhold from her ); nor of being provoked to exertion or even if she be not injudiciously thwarted to industry <\s>
<s> nor can there be any need to be sedulous in calling out her affections her own lively enjoyments will do all this for her and also point out what is to be done to her <\s>
<s> but take all the pains you can she will be too much noticed <\s>
<s> other evils will also beset her arising more from herself and how are these to be obviated <\s>
<s> but first let us attempt to find what these evils will be <\s>
<s> observe i put all gross mismanagement out of the question and i believe they will then probably be as follows first as mentioned before a considerable portion of vanity <\s>
<s> but if the child be not constrained too much and be left sufficiently to her own pursuits and be not too anxiously tended and have not her mind planted over by art with likings that do not spring naturally up in it this will by the liveliness of her independent enjoyment almost entirely disappear and she will become modest and diffident and being not apt from the same ruling cause i mean the freshness of her own sensations to compare herself with others she will hold herself in too humble estimation <\s>
<s> but she will probably still be selfish and this brings me to the explanation of what i hinted at before viz in what manner she will be selfish <\s>
<s> it appears then to me that all the permanent evils which you have to apprehend for your daughter supposing you should live to educate her yourself may be referred to this principle an undue predominance of present objects over absent ones which as she will surely be distinguished by an extreme love of those about her will produce a certain restlessness of mind calling perpetually for proofs of ever living regard and affection she must be loved as much and in the same way as she loves or she will not be satisfied <\s>
<s> hence quickness in taking offence petty jealousies and apprehensions lest she is neglected or loses ground in people's love a want of a calm and steady sense of her own merits to secure her from these fits of imagined slights for in the first place she will as is hinted at before be in general deficient in this just estimation of her own worth and will further be apt to forget everything of that kind in the present sense of supposed injury <\s>
<s> she will all which is referable to the same cause in the company of others have too constant a craving for sympathy up to a height beyond what her companions are capable of bestowing this will often be mortifying to herself and burthensome to others and should circumstances be untoward and her mind be not sufficiently furnished with ideas and knowledge this craving would be most pernicious to herself preying upon mind and body <\s>
<s> she will be too easily pleased apt to overrate the merits of new acquaintances subject to fits of over love and over joy in absence from those she loves full of fears and apprehensions c injurious to her health her passions for the most part will be happy and good but she will be too little mistress of them <\s>
<s> the distinctions which her intellect will make will be apt able and just but in conversation she will be prone to overshoot herself and commit eloquent blunders through eagerness <\s>
<s> in fine her manners will be frank and ardent but they will want dignity and a want of dignity will be the general defect of her character <\s>
<s> something of this sort of character which i have thus loosely sketched and something of the sort of selfishness to which i have adverted it seems to me that under the best management you have reason to apprehend for your daughter <\s>
<s> if she should happen to be an only child or the only sister of brothers who would probably idolize her one might prophesy almost with absolute confidence that most of these qualities would be found in her in a great degree <\s>
<s> how then is the evil to be softened down or prevented <\s>
<s> assuredly not by mortifying her which is the course commonly pursued with such tempers nor by preaching to her about her own defects nor by overrunning her infancy with books about good boys and girls and bad boys and girls and all that trumpery but and this is the only important thing i have to say upon the subject by putting her in the way of acquiring without measure or limit such knowledge as will lead her out of herself such knowledge as is interesting for its own sake things known because they are interesting not interesting because they are known in a word by leaving her at liberty to luxuriate in such feelings and images as will feed her mind in silent pleasure <\s>
<s> this nourishment is contained in fairy tales romances the best biographies and histories and such parts of natural history relating to the powers and appearances of the earth and elements and the habits and structure of animals as belong to it not as an art or science but as a magazine of form and feeling <\s>
<s> this kind of knowledge is purely good a direct antidote to every evil to be apprehended and food absolutely necessary to preserve the mind of a child like yours from morbid appetites <\s>
<s> next to these objects comes such knowledge as while it is chiefly interesting for its own sake admits the fellowship of another sort of pleasure that of complacence from the conscious exertion of the faculties and love of praise <\s>
<s> the accomplishments of dancing music and drawing rank under this head grammar learning of languages botany probably and out of the way knowledge of arts and manufactures c <\s>
<s> the second class of objects as far as they tend to feed vanity and self conceit are evil but let them have their just proportion in the plan of education and they will afterwards contribute to destroy these by furnishing the mind with power and independent gratification the vanity will disappear and the good will remain <\s>
<s> lastly comes that class of objects which are interesting almost solely because they are known and the knowledge may be displayed and this unfortunately comprehends three fourths of what according to the plan of modern education children's heads are stuffed with that is minute remote or trifling facts in geography topography natural history chronology c or acquisitions in art or accomplishments which the child makes by rote and which are quite beyond its age things of no value in themselves but as they show cleverness things hurtful to any temper but to a child like yours absolute poison <\s>
<s> having said thus much it seems almost impertinent to add that your child above all should i might say be chained down to the severest attention to truth i mean to the minutest accuracy in every thing which she relates this will strike at the root of evil by teaching her to form correct notions of present things and will steadily strengthen her mind <\s>
<s> much caution should be taken not to damp her natural vivacity for this may have a very bad effect and by the indirect influence of the example of manly and dignified manners any excessive wildnesses of her own will be best kept under <\s>
<s> most unrelaxing firmness should from the present hour be maintained in withstanding such of her desires as are grossly unreasonable <\s>
<s> in those words it was his purpose to censure that barren contemplation which rests satisfied with itself in cases where the thoughts are of such quality that they may and ought to be embodied in action <\s>
<s> but he speaks now of the general superiority of thought to action as proceeding and governing all action that moves to salutary purposes and secondly as leading to elevation the absolute possession of the individual mind and to a consistency or harmony of the being within itself which no outward agency can reach to disturb or to impair and lastly as producing works of pure science or of the combined faculties of imagination feeling and reason works which both from their independence in their origin upon accident their nature their duration and the wide spread of their influence are entitled rightly to take place of the noblest and most beneficent deeds of heroes statesmen legislators or warriors <\s>
<s> yet beginning from the perception of this established superiority we do not suppose that the youth whom we wish to guide and encourage is to be insensible to those influences of wealth or rank or station by which the bulk of mankind are swayed <\s>
<s> our eyes have not been fixed upon virtue which lies apart from human nature or transcends it <\s>
<s> in fact there is no such virtue <\s>
<s> we neither suppose nor wish him to undervalue or slight these distinctions as modes of power things that may enable him to be more useful to his contemporaries nor as gratifications that may confer dignity upon his living person and through him upon those who love him nor as they may connect his name through a family to be founded by his success in a closer chain of gratitude with some portion of posterity who shall speak of him as among their ancestry with a more tender interest than the mere general bond of patriotism or humanity would supply <\s>
<s> we suppose no indifference to much less a contempt of these rewards but let them have their due place let it be ascertained when the soul is searched into that they are only an auxiliary motive to exertion never the principal or originating force <\s>
<s> if this be too much to expect from a youth who i take for granted possesses no ordinary endowments and whom circumstances with respect to the more dangerous passions have favoured then indeed must the noble spirit of the country be wasted away then would our institutions be deplorable and the education prevalent among us utterly vile and debasing <\s>
<s> but my correspondent who drew forth these thoughts has said rightly that the character of the age may not without injustice be thus branded <\s>
<s> he will not deny that without speaking of other countries there is in these islands in the departments of natural philosophy of mechanic ingenuity in the general activities of the country and in the particular excellence of individual minds in high stations civil or military enough to excite admiration and love in the sober minded and more than enough to intoxicate the youthful and inexperienced <\s>
<s> i will compare then an aspiring youth leaving the schools in which he has been disciplined and preparing to bear a part in the concerns of the world i will compare him in this season of eager admiration to a newly invested knight appearing with his blank unsignalized shield upon some day of solemn tournament at the court of the faery queen as that sovereignty was conceived to exist by the moral and imaginative genius of our divine spenser <\s>
<s> he does not himself immediately enter the lists as a combatant but he looks round him with a beating heart dazzled by the gorgeous pageantry the banners the impresses the ladies of overcoming beauty the persons of the knights now first seen by him the fame of whose actions is carried by the traveller like merchandize through the world and resounded upon the harp of the minstrel <\s>
<s> but i am not at liberty to make this comparison <\s>
<s> if a youth were to begin his career in such an assemblage with such examples to guide and to animate it will be pleaded there would be no cause for apprehension he could not falter he could not be misled <\s>
<s> but ours is notwithstanding its manifold excellences a degenerate age and recreant knights are among us far outnumbering the true <\s>
<s> a false gloriana in these days imposes worthless services which they who perform them in their blindness know not to be such and which are recompensed by rewards as worthless yet eagerly grasped at as if they were the immortal guerdon of virtue <\s>
<s> i have in this declaration insensibly overstepped the limits which i had determined not to pass let me be forgiven for it is hope which hath carried me forward <\s>
<s> in such a mixed assemblage as our age presents with its genuine merit and its large overbalance of alloy i may boldly ask into what errors either with respect to person or thing could a young man fall who had sincerely entered upon the course of moral discipline which has been recommended and to which the condition of youth it has been proved is favourable <\s>
<s> his opinions could no where deceive him beyond the point up to which after a season he would find that it was salutary for him to have been deceived <\s>
<s> for as that man cannot set a right value upon health who has never known sickness nor feel the blessing of ease who has been through his life a stranger to pain so can there be no confirmed and passionate love of truth for him who has not experienced the hollowness of error <\s>
<s> range against each other as advocates oppose as combatants two several intellects each strenuously asserting doctrines which he sincerely believes but the one contending for the worth and beauty of that garment which the other has outgrown and cast away <\s>
<s> mark the superiority the ease the dignity on the side of the more advanced mind how he overlooks his subject commands it from centre to circumference and hath the same thorough knowledge of the tenets which his adversary with impetuous zeal but in confusion also and thrown off his guard at every turn of the argument is labouring to maintain <\s>
<s> if it be a question of the fine arts poetry for instance the riper mind not only sees that his opponent is deceived but what is of far more importance sees how he is deceived <\s>
<s> the imagination stands before him with all its imperfections laid open as duped by shows enslaved by words corrupted by mistaken delicacy and false refinement as not having even attended with care to the reports of the senses and therefore deficient grossly in the rudiments of its own power <\s>
<s> he has noted how as a supposed necessary condition the understanding sleeps in order that the fancy may dream <\s>
<s> studied in the history of society and versed in the secret laws of thought he can pass regularly through all the gradations can pierce infallibly all the windings which false taste through ages has pursued from the very time when first through inexperience heedlessness or affectation the imagination took its departure from the side of truth its original parent <\s>
<s> can a disputant thus accoutred be withstood one to whom further every movement in the thoughts of his antagonist is revealed by the light of his own experience who therefore sympathizes with weakness gently and wins his way by forbearance and hath when needful an irresistible power of onset arising from gratitude to the truth which he vindicates not merely as a positive good for mankind but as his own especial rescue and redemption <\s>
<s> i might here conclude but my correspondent towards the close of his letter has written so feelingly upon the advantages to be derived in his estimation from a living instructor that i must not leave this part of the subject without a word of direct notice <\s>
<s> the friend cited some time ago 28 a passage from the prose works of milton eloquently describing the manner in which good and evil grow up together in the field of the world almost inseparably and insisting consequently upon the knowledge and survey of vice as necessary to the constituting of human virtue and the scanning of error to the confirmation of truth <\s>
<s> 28 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this be so and i have been reasoning to the same effect in the preceding paragraph the fact and the thoughts which it may suggest will if rightly applied tend to moderate an anxiety for the guidance of a more experienced or superior mind <\s>
<s> the advantage where it is possessed is far from being an absolute good nay such a preceptor ever at hand might prove an oppression not to be thrown off and a fatal hindrance <\s>
<s> grant that in the general tenor of his intercourse with his pupil he is forbearing and circumspect inasmuch as he is rich in that knowledge above all other necessary for a teacher which cannot exist without a liveliness of memory preserving for him an unbroken image of the winding excursive and often retrograde course along which his own intellect has passed <\s>
<s> grant that furnished with these distinct remembrances he wishes that the mind of his pupil should be free to luxuriate in the enjoyments loves and admirations appropriated to its age that he is not in haste to kill what he knows will in due time die of itself or be transmuted and put on a nobler form and higher faculties otherwise unattainable <\s>
<s> in a word that the teacher is governed habitually by the wisdom of patience waiting with pleasure <\s>
<s> yet perceiving how much the outward help of art can facilitate the progress of nature he may be betrayed into many unnecessary or pernicious mistakes where he deems his interference warranted by substantial experience <\s>
<s> and in spite of all his caution remarks may drop insensibly from him which shall wither in the mind of his pupil a generous sympathy destroy a sentiment of approbation or dislike not merely innocent but salutary and for the inexperienced disciple how many pleasures may be thus off what joy what admiration and what love <\s>
<s> while in their stead are introduced into the ingenuous mind misgivings a mistrust of its own evidence dispositions to affect to feel where there can be no real feeling indecisive judgments a superstructure of opinions that has no base to support it and words uttered by rote with the impertinence of a parrot or a mockingbird yet which may not be listened to with the same indifference as they cannot be heard without some feeling of moral disapprobation <\s>
<s> these results i contend whatever may be the benefit to be derived from such an enlightened teacher are in their degree inevitable <\s>
<s> and by this process humility and docile dispositions may exist towards the master endued as he is with the power which personal presence confers but at the same time they will be liable to overstep their due bounds and to degenerate into passiveness and prostration of mind <\s>
<s> this towards him while with respect to other living men nay even to the mighty spirits of past times there may be associated with such weakness a want of modesty and humility <\s>
<s> insensibly may steal in presumption and a habit of sitting in judgment in cases where no sentiment ought to have existed but diffidence or veneration <\s>
<s> such virtues are the sacred attributes of youth its appropriate calling is not to distinguish in the fear of being deceived or degraded not to analyze with scrupulous minuteness but to accumulate in genial confidence its instinct its safety its benefit its glory is to love to admire to feel and to labour <\s>
<s> nature has irrevocably decreed that our prime dependence in all stages of life after infancy and childhood have been passed through nor do i know that this latter ought to be excepted must be upon our own minds and that the way to knowledge shall be long difficult winding and oftentimes returning upon itself <\s>
<s> what has been said is a mere sketch and that only of a part of the interesting country into which we have been led but my correspondent will be able to enter the paths that have been pointed out <\s>
<s> should he do this and advance steadily for a while he needs not fear any deviations from the truth which will be finally injurious to him <\s>
<s> he will not long have his admiration fixed upon unworthy objects he will neither be clogged nor drawn aside by the love of friends or kindred betraying his understanding through his affections he will neither be bowed down by conventional arrangements of manners producing too often a lifeless decency nor will the rock of his spirit wear away in the endless beating of the waves of the world neither will that portion of his own time which he must surrender to labours by which his livelihood is to be earned or his social duties performed be unprofitable to himself indirectly while it is directly useful to others for that time has been primarily surrendered through an act of obedience to a moral law established by himself and therefore he moves them also along the orbit of perfect liberty <\s>
<s> let it be remembered that the advice requested does not relate to the government of the more dangerous passions or to the fundamental principles of right and wrong as acknowledged by the universal conscience of mankind <\s>
<s> i may therefore assure my youthful correspondent if he will endeavour to look into himself in the manner which i have exhorted him to do that in him the wish will be realized to him in due time the prayer granted which was uttered by that living teacher of whom he speaks with gratitude as of a benefactor when in his character of philosophical poet having thought of morality as implying in its essence voluntary obedience and producing the effect of order he transfers in the transport of imagination the law of moral to physical natures and having contemplated through the medium of that order all modes of existence as subservient to one spirit concludes his address to the power of duty in the following words to humbler functions awful power <\s>
<s> i call thee i myself commend unto thy guidance from this hour oh let my weakness have an end <\s>
<s> give unto me made lowly wise the spirit of self sacrifice the confidence of reason give and in the light of truth thy bondman let me live <\s>

<s> my dear sir i am happy to hear of the instructions which you are preparing for parents and feel honoured by your having offered to me such an opportunity of conveying to the public any information i may possess upon the subject but in truth i am so little competent in the present unarranged state of my ideas to write any thing of value that it would be the highest presumption in me to attempt it <\s>
<s> this is not mock modesty but rigorous and sober truth <\s>
<s> as to the case of your own child i will set down a few thoughts which i do not hope will throw much light on your mind but they will show my willingness to do the little that is in my power <\s>

<s> my dear sir i am happy to hear of the instructions which you are preparing for parents and feel honoured by your having offered to me such an opportunity of conveying to the public any information i may possess upon the subject but in truth i am so little competent in the present unarranged state of my ideas to write any thing of value that it would be the highest presumption in me to attempt it <\s>
<s> this is not mock modesty but rigorous and sober truth <\s>
<s> as to the case of your own child i will set down a few thoughts which i do not hope will throw much light on your mind but they will show my willingness to do the little that is in my power <\s>
<s> the child being the child of a man like you what i have to say will lie in small compass <\s>
<s> i consider the facts which you mention as indicative of what is commonly called sensibility and of quickness and talent and shall take for granted that they are so you add that the child is too much noticed by grown people and apprehend selfishness <\s>
<s> such a child will almost always be too much noticed and it is scarcely possible entirely to guard against the evil hence vanity and under bad management selfishness of the worst kind <\s>
<s> and true it is that under better and even the best management such constitutions are liable to selfishness not showing itself in the shape of tyranny caprice avarice meanness envy skulking and base self reference but selfishness of a worthier kind yet still rightly called by that name <\s>
<s> what i mean i shall explain afterwards <\s>
<s> vanity is not the necessary or even natural growth of such a temperament quite the contrary <\s>
<s> such a child if neglected and suffered to run wild would probably be entirely free from vanity owing to the liveliness of its feelings and the number of its resources <\s>
<s> it would be by nature independent and sufficient for itself <\s>
<s> but as such children in these times in particular are rarely if ever neglected or rather rarely if ever not far too much noticed it is a hundred to one your child will have more vanity than you could wish <\s>
<s> this is one evil to be guarded against <\s>
<s> formerly indeed till within these few years children were very carelessly brought up at present they too early and too habitually feel their own importance from the solicitude and unremitting attendance which is bestowed upon them <\s>
<s> a child like yours i believe unless under the wisest guidance would prosper most where she was the least noticed and the least made of i mean more than this where she received the least cultivation <\s>
<s> she does not stand in need of the stimulus of praise as much as can benefit her i e as much as her nature requires it will be impossible to withhold from her ); nor of being provoked to exertion or even if she be not injudiciously thwarted to industry <\s>
<s> nor can there be any need to be sedulous in calling out her affections her own lively enjoyments will do all this for her and also point out what is to be done to her <\s>
<s> but take all the pains you can she will be too much noticed <\s>
<s> other evils will also beset her arising more from herself and how are these to be obviated <\s>
<s> but first let us attempt to find what these evils will be <\s>
<s> observe i put all gross mismanagement out of the question and i believe they will then probably be as follows first as mentioned before a considerable portion of vanity <\s>
<s> but if the child be not constrained too much and be left sufficiently to her own pursuits and be not too anxiously tended and have not her mind planted over by art with likings that do not spring naturally up in it this will by the liveliness of her independent enjoyment almost entirely disappear and she will become modest and diffident and being not apt from the same ruling cause i mean the freshness of her own sensations to compare herself with others she will hold herself in too humble estimation <\s>
<s> but she will probably still be selfish and this brings me to the explanation of what i hinted at before viz in what manner she will be selfish <\s>
<s> it appears then to me that all the permanent evils which you have to apprehend for your daughter supposing you should live to educate her yourself may be referred to this principle an undue predominance of present objects over absent ones which as she will surely be distinguished by an extreme love of those about her will produce a certain restlessness of mind calling perpetually for proofs of ever living regard and affection she must be loved as much and in the same way as she loves or she will not be satisfied <\s>
<s> hence quickness in taking offence petty jealousies and apprehensions lest she is neglected or loses ground in people's love a want of a calm and steady sense of her own merits to secure her from these fits of imagined slights for in the first place she will as is hinted at before be in general deficient in this just estimation of her own worth and will further be apt to forget everything of that kind in the present sense of supposed injury <\s>
<s> she will all which is referable to the same cause in the company of others have too constant a craving for sympathy up to a height beyond what her companions are capable of bestowing this will often be mortifying to herself and burthensome to others and should circumstances be untoward and her mind be not sufficiently furnished with ideas and knowledge this craving would be most pernicious to herself preying upon mind and body <\s>
<s> she will be too easily pleased apt to overrate the merits of new acquaintances subject to fits of over love and over joy in absence from those she loves full of fears and apprehensions c injurious to her health her passions for the most part will be happy and good but she will be too little mistress of them <\s>
<s> the distinctions which her intellect will make will be apt able and just but in conversation she will be prone to overshoot herself and commit eloquent blunders through eagerness <\s>
<s> in fine her manners will be frank and ardent but they will want dignity and a want of dignity will be the general defect of her character <\s>
<s> something of this sort of character which i have thus loosely sketched and something of the sort of selfishness to which i have adverted it seems to me that under the best management you have reason to apprehend for your daughter <\s>
<s> if she should happen to be an only child or the only sister of brothers who would probably idolize her one might prophesy almost with absolute confidence that most of these qualities would be found in her in a great degree <\s>
<s> how then is the evil to be softened down or prevented <\s>
<s> assuredly not by mortifying her which is the course commonly pursued with such tempers nor by preaching to her about her own defects nor by overrunning her infancy with books about good boys and girls and bad boys and girls and all that trumpery but and this is the only important thing i have to say upon the subject by putting her in the way of acquiring without measure or limit such knowledge as will lead her out of herself such knowledge as is interesting for its own sake things known because they are interesting not interesting because they are known in a word by leaving her at liberty to luxuriate in such feelings and images as will feed her mind in silent pleasure <\s>
<s> this nourishment is contained in fairy tales romances the best biographies and histories and such parts of natural history relating to the powers and appearances of the earth and elements and the habits and structure of animals as belong to it not as an art or science but as a magazine of form and feeling <\s>
<s> this kind of knowledge is purely good a direct antidote to every evil to be apprehended and food absolutely necessary to preserve the mind of a child like yours from morbid appetites <\s>
<s> next to these objects comes such knowledge as while it is chiefly interesting for its own sake admits the fellowship of another sort of pleasure that of complacence from the conscious exertion of the faculties and love of praise <\s>
<s> the accomplishments of dancing music and drawing rank under this head grammar learning of languages botany probably and out of the way knowledge of arts and manufactures c <\s>
<s> the second class of objects as far as they tend to feed vanity and self conceit are evil but let them have their just proportion in the plan of education and they will afterwards contribute to destroy these by furnishing the mind with power and independent gratification the vanity will disappear and the good will remain <\s>
<s> lastly comes that class of objects which are interesting almost solely because they are known and the knowledge may be displayed and this unfortunately comprehends three fourths of what according to the plan of modern education children's heads are stuffed with that is minute remote or trifling facts in geography topography natural history chronology c or acquisitions in art or accomplishments which the child makes by rote and which are quite beyond its age things of no value in themselves but as they show cleverness things hurtful to any temper but to a child like yours absolute poison <\s>
<s> having said thus much it seems almost impertinent to add that your child above all should i might say be chained down to the severest attention to truth i mean to the minutest accuracy in every thing which she relates this will strike at the root of evil by teaching her to form correct notions of present things and will steadily strengthen her mind <\s>
<s> much caution should be taken not to damp her natural vivacity for this may have a very bad effect and by the indirect influence of the example of manly and dignified manners any excessive wildnesses of her own will be best kept under <\s>
<s> most unrelaxing firmness should from the present hour be maintained in withstanding such of her desires as are grossly unreasonable <\s>
<s> in those words it was his purpose to censure that barren contemplation which rests satisfied with itself in cases where the thoughts are of such quality that they may and ought to be embodied in action <\s>
<s> but he speaks now of the general superiority of thought to action as proceeding and governing all action that moves to salutary purposes and secondly as leading to elevation the absolute possession of the individual mind and to a consistency or harmony of the being within itself which no outward agency can reach to disturb or to impair and lastly as producing works of pure science or of the combined faculties of imagination feeling and reason works which both from their independence in their origin upon accident their nature their duration and the wide spread of their influence are entitled rightly to take place of the noblest and most beneficent deeds of heroes statesmen legislators or warriors <\s>
<s> yet beginning from the perception of this established superiority we do not suppose that the youth whom we wish to guide and encourage is to be insensible to those influences of wealth or rank or station by which the bulk of mankind are swayed <\s>
<s> our eyes have not been fixed upon virtue which lies apart from human nature or transcends it <\s>
<s> in fact there is no such virtue <\s>
<s> we neither suppose nor wish him to undervalue or slight these distinctions as modes of power things that may enable him to be more useful to his contemporaries nor as gratifications that may confer dignity upon his living person and through him upon those who love him nor as they may connect his name through a family to be founded by his success in a closer chain of gratitude with some portion of posterity who shall speak of him as among their ancestry with a more tender interest than the mere general bond of patriotism or humanity would supply <\s>
<s> we suppose no indifference to much less a contempt of these rewards but let them have their due place let it be ascertained when the soul is searched into that they are only an auxiliary motive to exertion never the principal or originating force <\s>
<s> if this be too much to expect from a youth who i take for granted possesses no ordinary endowments and whom circumstances with respect to the more dangerous passions have favoured then indeed must the noble spirit of the country be wasted away then would our institutions be deplorable and the education prevalent among us utterly vile and debasing <\s>
<s> but my correspondent who drew forth these thoughts has said rightly that the character of the age may not without injustice be thus branded <\s>
<s> he will not deny that without speaking of other countries there is in these islands in the departments of natural philosophy of mechanic ingenuity in the general activities of the country and in the particular excellence of individual minds in high stations civil or military enough to excite admiration and love in the sober minded and more than enough to intoxicate the youthful and inexperienced <\s>
<s> i will compare then an aspiring youth leaving the schools in which he has been disciplined and preparing to bear a part in the concerns of the world i will compare him in this season of eager admiration to a newly invested knight appearing with his blank unsignalized shield upon some day of solemn tournament at the court of the faery queen as that sovereignty was conceived to exist by the moral and imaginative genius of our divine spenser <\s>
<s> he does not himself immediately enter the lists as a combatant but he looks round him with a beating heart dazzled by the gorgeous pageantry the banners the impresses the ladies of overcoming beauty the persons of the knights now first seen by him the fame of whose actions is carried by the traveller like merchandize through the world and resounded upon the harp of the minstrel <\s>
<s> but i am not at liberty to make this comparison <\s>
<s> if a youth were to begin his career in such an assemblage with such examples to guide and to animate it will be pleaded there would be no cause for apprehension he could not falter he could not be misled <\s>
<s> but ours is notwithstanding its manifold excellences a degenerate age and recreant knights are among us far outnumbering the true <\s>
<s> a false gloriana in these days imposes worthless services which they who perform them in their blindness know not to be such and which are recompensed by rewards as worthless yet eagerly grasped at as if they were the immortal guerdon of virtue <\s>
<s> i have in this declaration insensibly overstepped the limits which i had determined not to pass let me be forgiven for it is hope which hath carried me forward <\s>
<s> in such a mixed assemblage as our age presents with its genuine merit and its large overbalance of alloy i may boldly ask into what errors either with respect to person or thing could a young man fall who had sincerely entered upon the course of moral discipline which has been recommended and to which the condition of youth it has been proved is favourable <\s>
<s> his opinions could no where deceive him beyond the point up to which after a season he would find that it was salutary for him to have been deceived <\s>
<s> for as that man cannot set a right value upon health who has never known sickness nor feel the blessing of ease who has been through his life a stranger to pain so can there be no confirmed and passionate love of truth for him who has not experienced the hollowness of error <\s>
<s> range against each other as advocates oppose as combatants two several intellects each strenuously asserting doctrines which he sincerely believes but the one contending for the worth and beauty of that garment which the other has outgrown and cast away <\s>
<s> mark the superiority the ease the dignity on the side of the more advanced mind how he overlooks his subject commands it from centre to circumference and hath the same thorough knowledge of the tenets which his adversary with impetuous zeal but in confusion also and thrown off his guard at every turn of the argument is labouring to maintain <\s>
<s> if it be a question of the fine arts poetry for instance the riper mind not only sees that his opponent is deceived but what is of far more importance sees how he is deceived <\s>
<s> the imagination stands before him with all its imperfections laid open as duped by shows enslaved by words corrupted by mistaken delicacy and false refinement as not having even attended with care to the reports of the senses and therefore deficient grossly in the rudiments of its own power <\s>

<s> can a disputant thus accoutred be withstood one to whom further every movement in the thoughts of his antagonist is revealed by the light of his own experience who therefore sympathizes with weakness gently and wins his way by forbearance and hath when needful an irresistible power of onset arising from gratitude to the truth which he vindicates not merely as a positive good for mankind but as his own especial rescue and redemption <\s>
<s> i might here conclude but my correspondent towards the close of his letter has written so feelingly upon the advantages to be derived in his estimation from a living instructor that i must not leave this part of the subject without a word of direct notice <\s>
<s> the friend cited some time ago 28 a passage from the prose works of milton eloquently describing the manner in which good and evil grow up together in the field of the world almost inseparably and insisting consequently upon the knowledge and survey of vice as necessary to the constituting of human virtue and the scanning of error to the confirmation of truth <\s>

<s> letter to a friend 1806 <\s>
<s> my dear sir i am happy to hear of the instructions which you are preparing for parents and feel honoured by your having offered to me such an opportunity of conveying to the public any information i may possess upon the subject but in truth i am so little competent in the present unarranged state of my ideas to write any thing of value that it would be the highest presumption in me to attempt it <\s>
<s> this is not mock modesty but rigorous and sober truth <\s>
<s> as to the case of your own child i will set down a few thoughts which i do not hope will throw much light on your mind but they will show my willingness to do the little that is in my power <\s>
<s> the child being the child of a man like you what i have to say will lie in small compass <\s>
<s> i consider the facts which you mention as indicative of what is commonly called sensibility and of quickness and talent and shall take for granted that they are so you add that the child is too much noticed by grown people and apprehend selfishness <\s>
<s> such a child will almost always be too much noticed and it is scarcely possible entirely to guard against the evil hence vanity and under bad management selfishness of the worst kind <\s>
<s> and true it is that under better and even the best management such constitutions are liable to selfishness not showing itself in the shape of tyranny caprice avarice meanness envy skulking and base self reference but selfishness of a worthier kind yet still rightly called by that name <\s>
<s> what i mean i shall explain afterwards <\s>
<s> vanity is not the necessary or even natural growth of such a temperament quite the contrary <\s>
<s> such a child if neglected and suffered to run wild would probably be entirely free from vanity owing to the liveliness of its feelings and the number of its resources <\s>
<s> it would be by nature independent and sufficient for itself <\s>
<s> but as such children in these times in particular are rarely if ever neglected or rather rarely if ever not far too much noticed it is a hundred to one your child will have more vanity than you could wish <\s>
<s> this is one evil to be guarded against <\s>
<s> formerly indeed till within these few years children were very carelessly brought up at present they too early and too habitually feel their own importance from the solicitude and unremitting attendance which is bestowed upon them <\s>
<s> a child like yours i believe unless under the wisest guidance would prosper most where she was the least noticed and the least made of i mean more than this where she received the least cultivation <\s>
<s> she does not stand in need of the stimulus of praise as much as can benefit her i e as much as her nature requires it will be impossible to withhold from her ); nor of being provoked to exertion or even if she be not injudiciously thwarted to industry <\s>
<s> nor can there be any need to be sedulous in calling out her affections her own lively enjoyments will do all this for her and also point out what is to be done to her <\s>
<s> but take all the pains you can she will be too much noticed <\s>
<s> other evils will also beset her arising more from herself and how are these to be obviated <\s>
<s> but first let us attempt to find what these evils will be <\s>
<s> observe i put all gross mismanagement out of the question and i believe they will then probably be as follows first as mentioned before a considerable portion of vanity <\s>
<s> but if the child be not constrained too much and be left sufficiently to her own pursuits and be not too anxiously tended and have not her mind planted over by art with likings that do not spring naturally up in it this will by the liveliness of her independent enjoyment almost entirely disappear and she will become modest and diffident and being not apt from the same ruling cause i mean the freshness of her own sensations to compare herself with others she will hold herself in too humble estimation <\s>
<s> but she will probably still be selfish and this brings me to the explanation of what i hinted at before viz in what manner she will be selfish <\s>
<s> it appears then to me that all the permanent evils which you have to apprehend for your daughter supposing you should live to educate her yourself may be referred to this principle an undue predominance of present objects over absent ones which as she will surely be distinguished by an extreme love of those about her will produce a certain restlessness of mind calling perpetually for proofs of ever living regard and affection she must be loved as much and in the same way as she loves or she will not be satisfied <\s>
<s> hence quickness in taking offence petty jealousies and apprehensions lest she is neglected or loses ground in people's love a want of a calm and steady sense of her own merits to secure her from these fits of imagined slights for in the first place she will as is hinted at before be in general deficient in this just estimation of her own worth and will further be apt to forget everything of that kind in the present sense of supposed injury <\s>
<s> she will all which is referable to the same cause in the company of others have too constant a craving for sympathy up to a height beyond what her companions are capable of bestowing this will often be mortifying to herself and burthensome to others and should circumstances be untoward and her mind be not sufficiently furnished with ideas and knowledge this craving would be most pernicious to herself preying upon mind and body <\s>
<s> she will be too easily pleased apt to overrate the merits of new acquaintances subject to fits of over love and over joy in absence from those she loves full of fears and apprehensions c injurious to her health her passions for the most part will be happy and good but she will be too little mistress of them <\s>
<s> the distinctions which her intellect will make will be apt able and just but in conversation she will be prone to overshoot herself and commit eloquent blunders through eagerness <\s>
<s> in fine her manners will be frank and ardent but they will want dignity and a want of dignity will be the general defect of her character <\s>
<s> something of this sort of character which i have thus loosely sketched and something of the sort of selfishness to which i have adverted it seems to me that under the best management you have reason to apprehend for your daughter <\s>
<s> if she should happen to be an only child or the only sister of brothers who would probably idolize her one might prophesy almost with absolute confidence that most of these qualities would be found in her in a great degree <\s>
<s> how then is the evil to be softened down or prevented <\s>
<s> assuredly not by mortifying her which is the course commonly pursued with such tempers nor by preaching to her about her own defects nor by overrunning her infancy with books about good boys and girls and bad boys and girls and all that trumpery but and this is the only important thing i have to say upon the subject by putting her in the way of acquiring without measure or limit such knowledge as will lead her out of herself such knowledge as is interesting for its own sake things known because they are interesting not interesting because they are known in a word by leaving her at liberty to luxuriate in such feelings and images as will feed her mind in silent pleasure <\s>
<s> this nourishment is contained in fairy tales romances the best biographies and histories and such parts of natural history relating to the powers and appearances of the earth and elements and the habits and structure of animals as belong to it not as an art or science but as a magazine of form and feeling <\s>
<s> this kind of knowledge is purely good a direct antidote to every evil to be apprehended and food absolutely necessary to preserve the mind of a child like yours from morbid appetites <\s>
<s> next to these objects comes such knowledge as while it is chiefly interesting for its own sake admits the fellowship of another sort of pleasure that of complacence from the conscious exertion of the faculties and love of praise <\s>
<s> the accomplishments of dancing music and drawing rank under this head grammar learning of languages botany probably and out of the way knowledge of arts and manufactures c <\s>
<s> the second class of objects as far as they tend to feed vanity and self conceit are evil but let them have their just proportion in the plan of education and they will afterwards contribute to destroy these by furnishing the mind with power and independent gratification the vanity will disappear and the good will remain <\s>
<s> lastly comes that class of objects which are interesting almost solely because they are known and the knowledge may be displayed and this unfortunately comprehends three fourths of what according to the plan of modern education children's heads are stuffed with that is minute remote or trifling facts in geography topography natural history chronology c or acquisitions in art or accomplishments which the child makes by rote and which are quite beyond its age things of no value in themselves but as they show cleverness things hurtful to any temper but to a child like yours absolute poison <\s>
<s> having said thus much it seems almost impertinent to add that your child above all should i might say be chained down to the severest attention to truth i mean to the minutest accuracy in every thing which she relates this will strike at the root of evil by teaching her to form correct notions of present things and will steadily strengthen her mind <\s>
<s> much caution should be taken not to damp her natural vivacity for this may have a very bad effect and by the indirect influence of the example of manly and dignified manners any excessive wildnesses of her own will be best kept under <\s>
<s> most unrelaxing firmness should from the present hour be maintained in withstanding such of her desires as are grossly unreasonable <\s>
<s> in those words it was his purpose to censure that barren contemplation which rests satisfied with itself in cases where the thoughts are of such quality that they may and ought to be embodied in action <\s>

<s> my dear sir i am happy to hear of the instructions which you are preparing for parents and feel honoured by your having offered to me such an opportunity of conveying to the public any information i may possess upon the subject but in truth i am so little competent in the present unarranged state of my ideas to write any thing of value that it would be the highest presumption in me to attempt it <\s>
<s> this is not mock modesty but rigorous and sober truth <\s>
<s> as to the case of your own child i will set down a few thoughts which i do not hope will throw much light on your mind but they will show my willingness to do the little that is in my power <\s>
<s> the child being the child of a man like you what i have to say will lie in small compass <\s>
<s> i consider the facts which you mention as indicative of what is commonly called sensibility and of quickness and talent and shall take for granted that they are so you add that the child is too much noticed by grown people and apprehend selfishness <\s>
<s> such a child will almost always be too much noticed and it is scarcely possible entirely to guard against the evil hence vanity and under bad management selfishness of the worst kind <\s>
<s> and true it is that under better and even the best management such constitutions are liable to selfishness not showing itself in the shape of tyranny caprice avarice meanness envy skulking and base self reference but selfishness of a worthier kind yet still rightly called by that name <\s>
<s> what i mean i shall explain afterwards <\s>
<s> vanity is not the necessary or even natural growth of such a temperament quite the contrary <\s>
<s> such a child if neglected and suffered to run wild would probably be entirely free from vanity owing to the liveliness of its feelings and the number of its resources <\s>
<s> it would be by nature independent and sufficient for itself <\s>
<s> but as such children in these times in particular are rarely if ever neglected or rather rarely if ever not far too much noticed it is a hundred to one your child will have more vanity than you could wish <\s>
<s> this is one evil to be guarded against <\s>
<s> formerly indeed till within these few years children were very carelessly brought up at present they too early and too habitually feel their own importance from the solicitude and unremitting attendance which is bestowed upon them <\s>
<s> a child like yours i believe unless under the wisest guidance would prosper most where she was the least noticed and the least made of i mean more than this where she received the least cultivation <\s>
<s> she does not stand in need of the stimulus of praise as much as can benefit her i e as much as her nature requires it will be impossible to withhold from her ); nor of being provoked to exertion or even if she be not injudiciously thwarted to industry <\s>
<s> nor can there be any need to be sedulous in calling out her affections her own lively enjoyments will do all this for her and also point out what is to be done to her <\s>
<s> but take all the pains you can she will be too much noticed <\s>
<s> other evils will also beset her arising more from herself and how are these to be obviated <\s>
<s> but first let us attempt to find what these evils will be <\s>
<s> observe i put all gross mismanagement out of the question and i believe they will then probably be as follows first as mentioned before a considerable portion of vanity <\s>
<s> but if the child be not constrained too much and be left sufficiently to her own pursuits and be not too anxiously tended and have not her mind planted over by art with likings that do not spring naturally up in it this will by the liveliness of her independent enjoyment almost entirely disappear and she will become modest and diffident and being not apt from the same ruling cause i mean the freshness of her own sensations to compare herself with others she will hold herself in too humble estimation <\s>
<s> but she will probably still be selfish and this brings me to the explanation of what i hinted at before viz in what manner she will be selfish <\s>
<s> it appears then to me that all the permanent evils which you have to apprehend for your daughter supposing you should live to educate her yourself may be referred to this principle an undue predominance of present objects over absent ones which as she will surely be distinguished by an extreme love of those about her will produce a certain restlessness of mind calling perpetually for proofs of ever living regard and affection she must be loved as much and in the same way as she loves or she will not be satisfied <\s>
<s> hence quickness in taking offence petty jealousies and apprehensions lest she is neglected or loses ground in people's love a want of a calm and steady sense of her own merits to secure her from these fits of imagined slights for in the first place she will as is hinted at before be in general deficient in this just estimation of her own worth and will further be apt to forget everything of that kind in the present sense of supposed injury <\s>
<s> she will all which is referable to the same cause in the company of others have too constant a craving for sympathy up to a height beyond what her companions are capable of bestowing this will often be mortifying to herself and burthensome to others and should circumstances be untoward and her mind be not sufficiently furnished with ideas and knowledge this craving would be most pernicious to herself preying upon mind and body <\s>
<s> she will be too easily pleased apt to overrate the merits of new acquaintances subject to fits of over love and over joy in absence from those she loves full of fears and apprehensions c injurious to her health her passions for the most part will be happy and good but she will be too little mistress of them <\s>
<s> the distinctions which her intellect will make will be apt able and just but in conversation she will be prone to overshoot herself and commit eloquent blunders through eagerness <\s>
<s> in fine her manners will be frank and ardent but they will want dignity and a want of dignity will be the general defect of her character <\s>
<s> something of this sort of character which i have thus loosely sketched and something of the sort of selfishness to which i have adverted it seems to me that under the best management you have reason to apprehend for your daughter <\s>
<s> if she should happen to be an only child or the only sister of brothers who would probably idolize her one might prophesy almost with absolute confidence that most of these qualities would be found in her in a great degree <\s>
<s> how then is the evil to be softened down or prevented <\s>
<s> assuredly not by mortifying her which is the course commonly pursued with such tempers nor by preaching to her about her own defects nor by overrunning her infancy with books about good boys and girls and bad boys and girls and all that trumpery but and this is the only important thing i have to say upon the subject by putting her in the way of acquiring without measure or limit such knowledge as will lead her out of herself such knowledge as is interesting for its own sake things known because they are interesting not interesting because they are known in a word by leaving her at liberty to luxuriate in such feelings and images as will feed her mind in silent pleasure <\s>
<s> this nourishment is contained in fairy tales romances the best biographies and histories and such parts of natural history relating to the powers and appearances of the earth and elements and the habits and structure of animals as belong to it not as an art or science but as a magazine of form and feeling <\s>
<s> this kind of knowledge is purely good a direct antidote to every evil to be apprehended and food absolutely necessary to preserve the mind of a child like yours from morbid appetites <\s>
<s> next to these objects comes such knowledge as while it is chiefly interesting for its own sake admits the fellowship of another sort of pleasure that of complacence from the conscious exertion of the faculties and love of praise <\s>
<s> the accomplishments of dancing music and drawing rank under this head grammar learning of languages botany probably and out of the way knowledge of arts and manufactures c <\s>
<s> the second class of objects as far as they tend to feed vanity and self conceit are evil but let them have their just proportion in the plan of education and they will afterwards contribute to destroy these by furnishing the mind with power and independent gratification the vanity will disappear and the good will remain <\s>
<s> lastly comes that class of objects which are interesting almost solely because they are known and the knowledge may be displayed and this unfortunately comprehends three fourths of what according to the plan of modern education children's heads are stuffed with that is minute remote or trifling facts in geography topography natural history chronology c or acquisitions in art or accomplishments which the child makes by rote and which are quite beyond its age things of no value in themselves but as they show cleverness things hurtful to any temper but to a child like yours absolute poison <\s>
<s> having said thus much it seems almost impertinent to add that your child above all should i might say be chained down to the severest attention to truth i mean to the minutest accuracy in every thing which she relates this will strike at the root of evil by teaching her to form correct notions of present things and will steadily strengthen her mind <\s>
<s> much caution should be taken not to damp her natural vivacity for this may have a very bad effect and by the indirect influence of the example of manly and dignified manners any excessive wildnesses of her own will be best kept under <\s>
<s> most unrelaxing firmness should from the present hour be maintained in withstanding such of her desires as are grossly unreasonable <\s>
<s> in those words it was his purpose to censure that barren contemplation which rests satisfied with itself in cases where the thoughts are of such quality that they may and ought to be embodied in action <\s>
<s> but he speaks now of the general superiority of thought to action as proceeding and governing all action that moves to salutary purposes and secondly as leading to elevation the absolute possession of the individual mind and to a consistency or harmony of the being within itself which no outward agency can reach to disturb or to impair and lastly as producing works of pure science or of the combined faculties of imagination feeling and reason works which both from their independence in their origin upon accident their nature their duration and the wide spread of their influence are entitled rightly to take place of the noblest and most beneficent deeds of heroes statesmen legislators or warriors <\s>
<s> yet beginning from the perception of this established superiority we do not suppose that the youth whom we wish to guide and encourage is to be insensible to those influences of wealth or rank or station by which the bulk of mankind are swayed <\s>
<s> our eyes have not been fixed upon virtue which lies apart from human nature or transcends it <\s>
<s> in fact there is no such virtue <\s>
<s> we neither suppose nor wish him to undervalue or slight these distinctions as modes of power things that may enable him to be more useful to his contemporaries nor as gratifications that may confer dignity upon his living person and through him upon those who love him nor as they may connect his name through a family to be founded by his success in a closer chain of gratitude with some portion of posterity who shall speak of him as among their ancestry with a more tender interest than the mere general bond of patriotism or humanity would supply <\s>
<s> we suppose no indifference to much less a contempt of these rewards but let them have their due place let it be ascertained when the soul is searched into that they are only an auxiliary motive to exertion never the principal or originating force <\s>
<s> if this be too much to expect from a youth who i take for granted possesses no ordinary endowments and whom circumstances with respect to the more dangerous passions have favoured then indeed must the noble spirit of the country be wasted away then would our institutions be deplorable and the education prevalent among us utterly vile and debasing <\s>
<s> but my correspondent who drew forth these thoughts has said rightly that the character of the age may not without injustice be thus branded <\s>
<s> he will not deny that without speaking of other countries there is in these islands in the departments of natural philosophy of mechanic ingenuity in the general activities of the country and in the particular excellence of individual minds in high stations civil or military enough to excite admiration and love in the sober minded and more than enough to intoxicate the youthful and inexperienced <\s>
<s> i will compare then an aspiring youth leaving the schools in which he has been disciplined and preparing to bear a part in the concerns of the world i will compare him in this season of eager admiration to a newly invested knight appearing with his blank unsignalized shield upon some day of solemn tournament at the court of the faery queen as that sovereignty was conceived to exist by the moral and imaginative genius of our divine spenser <\s>
<s> he does not himself immediately enter the lists as a combatant but he looks round him with a beating heart dazzled by the gorgeous pageantry the banners the impresses the ladies of overcoming beauty the persons of the knights now first seen by him the fame of whose actions is carried by the traveller like merchandize through the world and resounded upon the harp of the minstrel <\s>
<s> but i am not at liberty to make this comparison <\s>
<s> if a youth were to begin his career in such an assemblage with such examples to guide and to animate it will be pleaded there would be no cause for apprehension he could not falter he could not be misled <\s>
<s> but ours is notwithstanding its manifold excellences a degenerate age and recreant knights are among us far outnumbering the true <\s>
<s> a false gloriana in these days imposes worthless services which they who perform them in their blindness know not to be such and which are recompensed by rewards as worthless yet eagerly grasped at as if they were the immortal guerdon of virtue <\s>
<s> i have in this declaration insensibly overstepped the limits which i had determined not to pass let me be forgiven for it is hope which hath carried me forward <\s>
<s> in such a mixed assemblage as our age presents with its genuine merit and its large overbalance of alloy i may boldly ask into what errors either with respect to person or thing could a young man fall who had sincerely entered upon the course of moral discipline which has been recommended and to which the condition of youth it has been proved is favourable <\s>
<s> his opinions could no where deceive him beyond the point up to which after a season he would find that it was salutary for him to have been deceived <\s>
<s> for as that man cannot set a right value upon health who has never known sickness nor feel the blessing of ease who has been through his life a stranger to pain so can there be no confirmed and passionate love of truth for him who has not experienced the hollowness of error <\s>
<s> range against each other as advocates oppose as combatants two several intellects each strenuously asserting doctrines which he sincerely believes but the one contending for the worth and beauty of that garment which the other has outgrown and cast away <\s>
<s> mark the superiority the ease the dignity on the side of the more advanced mind how he overlooks his subject commands it from centre to circumference and hath the same thorough knowledge of the tenets which his adversary with impetuous zeal but in confusion also and thrown off his guard at every turn of the argument is labouring to maintain <\s>
<s> if it be a question of the fine arts poetry for instance the riper mind not only sees that his opponent is deceived but what is of far more importance sees how he is deceived <\s>
<s> the imagination stands before him with all its imperfections laid open as duped by shows enslaved by words corrupted by mistaken delicacy and false refinement as not having even attended with care to the reports of the senses and therefore deficient grossly in the rudiments of its own power <\s>
<s> he has noted how as a supposed necessary condition the understanding sleeps in order that the fancy may dream <\s>
<s> studied in the history of society and versed in the secret laws of thought he can pass regularly through all the gradations can pierce infallibly all the windings which false taste through ages has pursued from the very time when first through inexperience heedlessness or affectation the imagination took its departure from the side of truth its original parent <\s>
<s> can a disputant thus accoutred be withstood one to whom further every movement in the thoughts of his antagonist is revealed by the light of his own experience who therefore sympathizes with weakness gently and wins his way by forbearance and hath when needful an irresistible power of onset arising from gratitude to the truth which he vindicates not merely as a positive good for mankind but as his own especial rescue and redemption <\s>
<s> i might here conclude but my correspondent towards the close of his letter has written so feelingly upon the advantages to be derived in his estimation from a living instructor that i must not leave this part of the subject without a word of direct notice <\s>
<s> the friend cited some time ago 28 a passage from the prose works of milton eloquently describing the manner in which good and evil grow up together in the field of the world almost inseparably and insisting consequently upon the knowledge and survey of vice as necessary to the constituting of human virtue and the scanning of error to the confirmation of truth <\s>
<s> 28 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this be so and i have been reasoning to the same effect in the preceding paragraph the fact and the thoughts which it may suggest will if rightly applied tend to moderate an anxiety for the guidance of a more experienced or superior mind <\s>
<s> the advantage where it is possessed is far from being an absolute good nay such a preceptor ever at hand might prove an oppression not to be thrown off and a fatal hindrance <\s>
<s> grant that in the general tenor of his intercourse with his pupil he is forbearing and circumspect inasmuch as he is rich in that knowledge above all other necessary for a teacher which cannot exist without a liveliness of memory preserving for him an unbroken image of the winding excursive and often retrograde course along which his own intellect has passed <\s>
<s> grant that furnished with these distinct remembrances he wishes that the mind of his pupil should be free to luxuriate in the enjoyments loves and admirations appropriated to its age that he is not in haste to kill what he knows will in due time die of itself or be transmuted and put on a nobler form and higher faculties otherwise unattainable <\s>
<s> in a word that the teacher is governed habitually by the wisdom of patience waiting with pleasure <\s>
<s> yet perceiving how much the outward help of art can facilitate the progress of nature he may be betrayed into many unnecessary or pernicious mistakes where he deems his interference warranted by substantial experience <\s>
<s> and in spite of all his caution remarks may drop insensibly from him which shall wither in the mind of his pupil a generous sympathy destroy a sentiment of approbation or dislike not merely innocent but salutary and for the inexperienced disciple how many pleasures may be thus off what joy what admiration and what love <\s>
<s> while in their stead are introduced into the ingenuous mind misgivings a mistrust of its own evidence dispositions to affect to feel where there can be no real feeling indecisive judgments a superstructure of opinions that has no base to support it and words uttered by rote with the impertinence of a parrot or a mockingbird yet which may not be listened to with the same indifference as they cannot be heard without some feeling of moral disapprobation <\s>
<s> these results i contend whatever may be the benefit to be derived from such an enlightened teacher are in their degree inevitable <\s>
<s> and by this process humility and docile dispositions may exist towards the master endued as he is with the power which personal presence confers but at the same time they will be liable to overstep their due bounds and to degenerate into passiveness and prostration of mind <\s>
<s> this towards him while with respect to other living men nay even to the mighty spirits of past times there may be associated with such weakness a want of modesty and humility <\s>
<s> insensibly may steal in presumption and a habit of sitting in judgment in cases where no sentiment ought to have existed but diffidence or veneration <\s>
<s> such virtues are the sacred attributes of youth its appropriate calling is not to distinguish in the fear of being deceived or degraded not to analyze with scrupulous minuteness but to accumulate in genial confidence its instinct its safety its benefit its glory is to love to admire to feel and to labour <\s>
<s> nature has irrevocably decreed that our prime dependence in all stages of life after infancy and childhood have been passed through nor do i know that this latter ought to be excepted must be upon our own minds and that the way to knowledge shall be long difficult winding and oftentimes returning upon itself <\s>
<s> what has been said is a mere sketch and that only of a part of the interesting country into which we have been led but my correspondent will be able to enter the paths that have been pointed out <\s>
<s> should he do this and advance steadily for a while he needs not fear any deviations from the truth which will be finally injurious to him <\s>

<s> my dear sir i am happy to hear of the instructions which you are preparing for parents and feel honoured by your having offered to me such an opportunity of conveying to the public any information i may possess upon the subject but in truth i am so little competent in the present unarranged state of my ideas to write any thing of value that it would be the highest presumption in me to attempt it <\s>
<s> this is not mock modesty but rigorous and sober truth <\s>
<s> as to the case of your own child i will set down a few thoughts which i do not hope will throw much light on your mind but they will show my willingness to do the little that is in my power <\s>
<s> the child being the child of a man like you what i have to say will lie in small compass <\s>
<s> i consider the facts which you mention as indicative of what is commonly called sensibility and of quickness and talent and shall take for granted that they are so you add that the child is too much noticed by grown people and apprehend selfishness <\s>
<s> such a child will almost always be too much noticed and it is scarcely possible entirely to guard against the evil hence vanity and under bad management selfishness of the worst kind <\s>
<s> and true it is that under better and even the best management such constitutions are liable to selfishness not showing itself in the shape of tyranny caprice avarice meanness envy skulking and base self reference but selfishness of a worthier kind yet still rightly called by that name <\s>
<s> what i mean i shall explain afterwards <\s>
<s> vanity is not the necessary or even natural growth of such a temperament quite the contrary <\s>
<s> such a child if neglected and suffered to run wild would probably be entirely free from vanity owing to the liveliness of its feelings and the number of its resources <\s>
<s> it would be by nature independent and sufficient for itself <\s>
<s> but as such children in these times in particular are rarely if ever neglected or rather rarely if ever not far too much noticed it is a hundred to one your child will have more vanity than you could wish <\s>
<s> this is one evil to be guarded against <\s>
<s> formerly indeed till within these few years children were very carelessly brought up at present they too early and too habitually feel their own importance from the solicitude and unremitting attendance which is bestowed upon them <\s>
<s> a child like yours i believe unless under the wisest guidance would prosper most where she was the least noticed and the least made of i mean more than this where she received the least cultivation <\s>
<s> she does not stand in need of the stimulus of praise as much as can benefit her i e as much as her nature requires it will be impossible to withhold from her ); nor of being provoked to exertion or even if she be not injudiciously thwarted to industry <\s>
<s> nor can there be any need to be sedulous in calling out her affections her own lively enjoyments will do all this for her and also point out what is to be done to her <\s>
<s> but take all the pains you can she will be too much noticed <\s>
<s> other evils will also beset her arising more from herself and how are these to be obviated <\s>
<s> but first let us attempt to find what these evils will be <\s>
<s> observe i put all gross mismanagement out of the question and i believe they will then probably be as follows first as mentioned before a considerable portion of vanity <\s>
<s> but if the child be not constrained too much and be left sufficiently to her own pursuits and be not too anxiously tended and have not her mind planted over by art with likings that do not spring naturally up in it this will by the liveliness of her independent enjoyment almost entirely disappear and she will become modest and diffident and being not apt from the same ruling cause i mean the freshness of her own sensations to compare herself with others she will hold herself in too humble estimation <\s>
<s> but she will probably still be selfish and this brings me to the explanation of what i hinted at before viz in what manner she will be selfish <\s>
<s> it appears then to me that all the permanent evils which you have to apprehend for your daughter supposing you should live to educate her yourself may be referred to this principle an undue predominance of present objects over absent ones which as she will surely be distinguished by an extreme love of those about her will produce a certain restlessness of mind calling perpetually for proofs of ever living regard and affection she must be loved as much and in the same way as she loves or she will not be satisfied <\s>
<s> hence quickness in taking offence petty jealousies and apprehensions lest she is neglected or loses ground in people's love a want of a calm and steady sense of her own merits to secure her from these fits of imagined slights for in the first place she will as is hinted at before be in general deficient in this just estimation of her own worth and will further be apt to forget everything of that kind in the present sense of supposed injury <\s>
<s> she will all which is referable to the same cause in the company of others have too constant a craving for sympathy up to a height beyond what her companions are capable of bestowing this will often be mortifying to herself and burthensome to others and should circumstances be untoward and her mind be not sufficiently furnished with ideas and knowledge this craving would be most pernicious to herself preying upon mind and body <\s>
<s> she will be too easily pleased apt to overrate the merits of new acquaintances subject to fits of over love and over joy in absence from those she loves full of fears and apprehensions c injurious to her health her passions for the most part will be happy and good but she will be too little mistress of them <\s>
<s> the distinctions which her intellect will make will be apt able and just but in conversation she will be prone to overshoot herself and commit eloquent blunders through eagerness <\s>
<s> in fine her manners will be frank and ardent but they will want dignity and a want of dignity will be the general defect of her character <\s>
<s> something of this sort of character which i have thus loosely sketched and something of the sort of selfishness to which i have adverted it seems to me that under the best management you have reason to apprehend for your daughter <\s>
<s> if she should happen to be an only child or the only sister of brothers who would probably idolize her one might prophesy almost with absolute confidence that most of these qualities would be found in her in a great degree <\s>
<s> how then is the evil to be softened down or prevented <\s>
<s> assuredly not by mortifying her which is the course commonly pursued with such tempers nor by preaching to her about her own defects nor by overrunning her infancy with books about good boys and girls and bad boys and girls and all that trumpery but and this is the only important thing i have to say upon the subject by putting her in the way of acquiring without measure or limit such knowledge as will lead her out of herself such knowledge as is interesting for its own sake things known because they are interesting not interesting because they are known in a word by leaving her at liberty to luxuriate in such feelings and images as will feed her mind in silent pleasure <\s>
<s> this nourishment is contained in fairy tales romances the best biographies and histories and such parts of natural history relating to the powers and appearances of the earth and elements and the habits and structure of animals as belong to it not as an art or science but as a magazine of form and feeling <\s>
<s> this kind of knowledge is purely good a direct antidote to every evil to be apprehended and food absolutely necessary to preserve the mind of a child like yours from morbid appetites <\s>
<s> next to these objects comes such knowledge as while it is chiefly interesting for its own sake admits the fellowship of another sort of pleasure that of complacence from the conscious exertion of the faculties and love of praise <\s>
<s> the accomplishments of dancing music and drawing rank under this head grammar learning of languages botany probably and out of the way knowledge of arts and manufactures c <\s>
<s> the second class of objects as far as they tend to feed vanity and self conceit are evil but let them have their just proportion in the plan of education and they will afterwards contribute to destroy these by furnishing the mind with power and independent gratification the vanity will disappear and the good will remain <\s>
<s> lastly comes that class of objects which are interesting almost solely because they are known and the knowledge may be displayed and this unfortunately comprehends three fourths of what according to the plan of modern education children's heads are stuffed with that is minute remote or trifling facts in geography topography natural history chronology c or acquisitions in art or accomplishments which the child makes by rote and which are quite beyond its age things of no value in themselves but as they show cleverness things hurtful to any temper but to a child like yours absolute poison <\s>
<s> having said thus much it seems almost impertinent to add that your child above all should i might say be chained down to the severest attention to truth i mean to the minutest accuracy in every thing which she relates this will strike at the root of evil by teaching her to form correct notions of present things and will steadily strengthen her mind <\s>
<s> much caution should be taken not to damp her natural vivacity for this may have a very bad effect and by the indirect influence of the example of manly and dignified manners any excessive wildnesses of her own will be best kept under <\s>
<s> most unrelaxing firmness should from the present hour be maintained in withstanding such of her desires as are grossly unreasonable <\s>
<s> in those words it was his purpose to censure that barren contemplation which rests satisfied with itself in cases where the thoughts are of such quality that they may and ought to be embodied in action <\s>
<s> but he speaks now of the general superiority of thought to action as proceeding and governing all action that moves to salutary purposes and secondly as leading to elevation the absolute possession of the individual mind and to a consistency or harmony of the being within itself which no outward agency can reach to disturb or to impair and lastly as producing works of pure science or of the combined faculties of imagination feeling and reason works which both from their independence in their origin upon accident their nature their duration and the wide spread of their influence are entitled rightly to take place of the noblest and most beneficent deeds of heroes statesmen legislators or warriors <\s>
<s> yet beginning from the perception of this established superiority we do not suppose that the youth whom we wish to guide and encourage is to be insensible to those influences of wealth or rank or station by which the bulk of mankind are swayed <\s>
<s> our eyes have not been fixed upon virtue which lies apart from human nature or transcends it <\s>
<s> in fact there is no such virtue <\s>
<s> we neither suppose nor wish him to undervalue or slight these distinctions as modes of power things that may enable him to be more useful to his contemporaries nor as gratifications that may confer dignity upon his living person and through him upon those who love him nor as they may connect his name through a family to be founded by his success in a closer chain of gratitude with some portion of posterity who shall speak of him as among their ancestry with a more tender interest than the mere general bond of patriotism or humanity would supply <\s>
<s> we suppose no indifference to much less a contempt of these rewards but let them have their due place let it be ascertained when the soul is searched into that they are only an auxiliary motive to exertion never the principal or originating force <\s>
<s> if this be too much to expect from a youth who i take for granted possesses no ordinary endowments and whom circumstances with respect to the more dangerous passions have favoured then indeed must the noble spirit of the country be wasted away then would our institutions be deplorable and the education prevalent among us utterly vile and debasing <\s>

<s> but as such children in these times in particular are rarely if ever neglected or rather rarely if ever not far too much noticed it is a hundred to one your child will have more vanity than you could wish <\s>
<s> this is one evil to be guarded against <\s>
<s> formerly indeed till within these few years children were very carelessly brought up at present they too early and too habitually feel their own importance from the solicitude and unremitting attendance which is bestowed upon them <\s>
<s> a child like yours i believe unless under the wisest guidance would prosper most where she was the least noticed and the least made of i mean more than this where she received the least cultivation <\s>
<s> she does not stand in need of the stimulus of praise as much as can benefit her i e as much as her nature requires it will be impossible to withhold from her ); nor of being provoked to exertion or even if she be not injudiciously thwarted to industry <\s>
<s> nor can there be any need to be sedulous in calling out her affections her own lively enjoyments will do all this for her and also point out what is to be done to her <\s>
<s> but take all the pains you can she will be too much noticed <\s>
<s> other evils will also beset her arising more from herself and how are these to be obviated <\s>
<s> but first let us attempt to find what these evils will be <\s>
<s> observe i put all gross mismanagement out of the question and i believe they will then probably be as follows first as mentioned before a considerable portion of vanity <\s>
<s> but if the child be not constrained too much and be left sufficiently to her own pursuits and be not too anxiously tended and have not her mind planted over by art with likings that do not spring naturally up in it this will by the liveliness of her independent enjoyment almost entirely disappear and she will become modest and diffident and being not apt from the same ruling cause i mean the freshness of her own sensations to compare herself with others she will hold herself in too humble estimation <\s>
<s> but she will probably still be selfish and this brings me to the explanation of what i hinted at before viz in what manner she will be selfish <\s>
<s> it appears then to me that all the permanent evils which you have to apprehend for your daughter supposing you should live to educate her yourself may be referred to this principle an undue predominance of present objects over absent ones which as she will surely be distinguished by an extreme love of those about her will produce a certain restlessness of mind calling perpetually for proofs of ever living regard and affection she must be loved as much and in the same way as she loves or she will not be satisfied <\s>
<s> hence quickness in taking offence petty jealousies and apprehensions lest she is neglected or loses ground in people's love a want of a calm and steady sense of her own merits to secure her from these fits of imagined slights for in the first place she will as is hinted at before be in general deficient in this just estimation of her own worth and will further be apt to forget everything of that kind in the present sense of supposed injury <\s>
<s> she will all which is referable to the same cause in the company of others have too constant a craving for sympathy up to a height beyond what her companions are capable of bestowing this will often be mortifying to herself and burthensome to others and should circumstances be untoward and her mind be not sufficiently furnished with ideas and knowledge this craving would be most pernicious to herself preying upon mind and body <\s>
<s> she will be too easily pleased apt to overrate the merits of new acquaintances subject to fits of over love and over joy in absence from those she loves full of fears and apprehensions c injurious to her health her passions for the most part will be happy and good but she will be too little mistress of them <\s>
<s> the distinctions which her intellect will make will be apt able and just but in conversation she will be prone to overshoot herself and commit eloquent blunders through eagerness <\s>
<s> in fine her manners will be frank and ardent but they will want dignity and a want of dignity will be the general defect of her character <\s>
<s> something of this sort of character which i have thus loosely sketched and something of the sort of selfishness to which i have adverted it seems to me that under the best management you have reason to apprehend for your daughter <\s>
<s> if she should happen to be an only child or the only sister of brothers who would probably idolize her one might prophesy almost with absolute confidence that most of these qualities would be found in her in a great degree <\s>
<s> how then is the evil to be softened down or prevented <\s>
<s> assuredly not by mortifying her which is the course commonly pursued with such tempers nor by preaching to her about her own defects nor by overrunning her infancy with books about good boys and girls and bad boys and girls and all that trumpery but and this is the only important thing i have to say upon the subject by putting her in the way of acquiring without measure or limit such knowledge as will lead her out of herself such knowledge as is interesting for its own sake things known because they are interesting not interesting because they are known in a word by leaving her at liberty to luxuriate in such feelings and images as will feed her mind in silent pleasure <\s>
<s> this nourishment is contained in fairy tales romances the best biographies and histories and such parts of natural history relating to the powers and appearances of the earth and elements and the habits and structure of animals as belong to it not as an art or science but as a magazine of form and feeling <\s>
<s> this kind of knowledge is purely good a direct antidote to every evil to be apprehended and food absolutely necessary to preserve the mind of a child like yours from morbid appetites <\s>
<s> next to these objects comes such knowledge as while it is chiefly interesting for its own sake admits the fellowship of another sort of pleasure that of complacence from the conscious exertion of the faculties and love of praise <\s>
<s> the accomplishments of dancing music and drawing rank under this head grammar learning of languages botany probably and out of the way knowledge of arts and manufactures c <\s>
<s> the second class of objects as far as they tend to feed vanity and self conceit are evil but let them have their just proportion in the plan of education and they will afterwards contribute to destroy these by furnishing the mind with power and independent gratification the vanity will disappear and the good will remain <\s>
<s> lastly comes that class of objects which are interesting almost solely because they are known and the knowledge may be displayed and this unfortunately comprehends three fourths of what according to the plan of modern education children's heads are stuffed with that is minute remote or trifling facts in geography topography natural history chronology c or acquisitions in art or accomplishments which the child makes by rote and which are quite beyond its age things of no value in themselves but as they show cleverness things hurtful to any temper but to a child like yours absolute poison <\s>
<s> having said thus much it seems almost impertinent to add that your child above all should i might say be chained down to the severest attention to truth i mean to the minutest accuracy in every thing which she relates this will strike at the root of evil by teaching her to form correct notions of present things and will steadily strengthen her mind <\s>
<s> much caution should be taken not to damp her natural vivacity for this may have a very bad effect and by the indirect influence of the example of manly and dignified manners any excessive wildnesses of her own will be best kept under <\s>
<s> most unrelaxing firmness should from the present hour be maintained in withstanding such of her desires as are grossly unreasonable <\s>
<s> in those words it was his purpose to censure that barren contemplation which rests satisfied with itself in cases where the thoughts are of such quality that they may and ought to be embodied in action <\s>
<s> but he speaks now of the general superiority of thought to action as proceeding and governing all action that moves to salutary purposes and secondly as leading to elevation the absolute possession of the individual mind and to a consistency or harmony of the being within itself which no outward agency can reach to disturb or to impair and lastly as producing works of pure science or of the combined faculties of imagination feeling and reason works which both from their independence in their origin upon accident their nature their duration and the wide spread of their influence are entitled rightly to take place of the noblest and most beneficent deeds of heroes statesmen legislators or warriors <\s>
<s> yet beginning from the perception of this established superiority we do not suppose that the youth whom we wish to guide and encourage is to be insensible to those influences of wealth or rank or station by which the bulk of mankind are swayed <\s>
<s> our eyes have not been fixed upon virtue which lies apart from human nature or transcends it <\s>
<s> in fact there is no such virtue <\s>
<s> we neither suppose nor wish him to undervalue or slight these distinctions as modes of power things that may enable him to be more useful to his contemporaries nor as gratifications that may confer dignity upon his living person and through him upon those who love him nor as they may connect his name through a family to be founded by his success in a closer chain of gratitude with some portion of posterity who shall speak of him as among their ancestry with a more tender interest than the mere general bond of patriotism or humanity would supply <\s>
<s> we suppose no indifference to much less a contempt of these rewards but let them have their due place let it be ascertained when the soul is searched into that they are only an auxiliary motive to exertion never the principal or originating force <\s>
<s> if this be too much to expect from a youth who i take for granted possesses no ordinary endowments and whom circumstances with respect to the more dangerous passions have favoured then indeed must the noble spirit of the country be wasted away then would our institutions be deplorable and the education prevalent among us utterly vile and debasing <\s>
<s> but my correspondent who drew forth these thoughts has said rightly that the character of the age may not without injustice be thus branded <\s>
<s> he will not deny that without speaking of other countries there is in these islands in the departments of natural philosophy of mechanic ingenuity in the general activities of the country and in the particular excellence of individual minds in high stations civil or military enough to excite admiration and love in the sober minded and more than enough to intoxicate the youthful and inexperienced <\s>
<s> i will compare then an aspiring youth leaving the schools in which he has been disciplined and preparing to bear a part in the concerns of the world i will compare him in this season of eager admiration to a newly invested knight appearing with his blank unsignalized shield upon some day of solemn tournament at the court of the faery queen as that sovereignty was conceived to exist by the moral and imaginative genius of our divine spenser <\s>
<s> he does not himself immediately enter the lists as a combatant but he looks round him with a beating heart dazzled by the gorgeous pageantry the banners the impresses the ladies of overcoming beauty the persons of the knights now first seen by him the fame of whose actions is carried by the traveller like merchandize through the world and resounded upon the harp of the minstrel <\s>
<s> but i am not at liberty to make this comparison <\s>
<s> if a youth were to begin his career in such an assemblage with such examples to guide and to animate it will be pleaded there would be no cause for apprehension he could not falter he could not be misled <\s>
<s> but ours is notwithstanding its manifold excellences a degenerate age and recreant knights are among us far outnumbering the true <\s>
<s> a false gloriana in these days imposes worthless services which they who perform them in their blindness know not to be such and which are recompensed by rewards as worthless yet eagerly grasped at as if they were the immortal guerdon of virtue <\s>
<s> i have in this declaration insensibly overstepped the limits which i had determined not to pass let me be forgiven for it is hope which hath carried me forward <\s>
<s> in such a mixed assemblage as our age presents with its genuine merit and its large overbalance of alloy i may boldly ask into what errors either with respect to person or thing could a young man fall who had sincerely entered upon the course of moral discipline which has been recommended and to which the condition of youth it has been proved is favourable <\s>
<s> his opinions could no where deceive him beyond the point up to which after a season he would find that it was salutary for him to have been deceived <\s>
<s> for as that man cannot set a right value upon health who has never known sickness nor feel the blessing of ease who has been through his life a stranger to pain so can there be no confirmed and passionate love of truth for him who has not experienced the hollowness of error <\s>
<s> range against each other as advocates oppose as combatants two several intellects each strenuously asserting doctrines which he sincerely believes but the one contending for the worth and beauty of that garment which the other has outgrown and cast away <\s>
<s> mark the superiority the ease the dignity on the side of the more advanced mind how he overlooks his subject commands it from centre to circumference and hath the same thorough knowledge of the tenets which his adversary with impetuous zeal but in confusion also and thrown off his guard at every turn of the argument is labouring to maintain <\s>
<s> if it be a question of the fine arts poetry for instance the riper mind not only sees that his opponent is deceived but what is of far more importance sees how he is deceived <\s>
<s> the imagination stands before him with all its imperfections laid open as duped by shows enslaved by words corrupted by mistaken delicacy and false refinement as not having even attended with care to the reports of the senses and therefore deficient grossly in the rudiments of its own power <\s>
<s> he has noted how as a supposed necessary condition the understanding sleeps in order that the fancy may dream <\s>
<s> studied in the history of society and versed in the secret laws of thought he can pass regularly through all the gradations can pierce infallibly all the windings which false taste through ages has pursued from the very time when first through inexperience heedlessness or affectation the imagination took its departure from the side of truth its original parent <\s>
<s> can a disputant thus accoutred be withstood one to whom further every movement in the thoughts of his antagonist is revealed by the light of his own experience who therefore sympathizes with weakness gently and wins his way by forbearance and hath when needful an irresistible power of onset arising from gratitude to the truth which he vindicates not merely as a positive good for mankind but as his own especial rescue and redemption <\s>
<s> i might here conclude but my correspondent towards the close of his letter has written so feelingly upon the advantages to be derived in his estimation from a living instructor that i must not leave this part of the subject without a word of direct notice <\s>
<s> the friend cited some time ago 28 a passage from the prose works of milton eloquently describing the manner in which good and evil grow up together in the field of the world almost inseparably and insisting consequently upon the knowledge and survey of vice as necessary to the constituting of human virtue and the scanning of error to the confirmation of truth <\s>
<s> 28 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this be so and i have been reasoning to the same effect in the preceding paragraph the fact and the thoughts which it may suggest will if rightly applied tend to moderate an anxiety for the guidance of a more experienced or superior mind <\s>
<s> the advantage where it is possessed is far from being an absolute good nay such a preceptor ever at hand might prove an oppression not to be thrown off and a fatal hindrance <\s>
<s> grant that in the general tenor of his intercourse with his pupil he is forbearing and circumspect inasmuch as he is rich in that knowledge above all other necessary for a teacher which cannot exist without a liveliness of memory preserving for him an unbroken image of the winding excursive and often retrograde course along which his own intellect has passed <\s>
<s> grant that furnished with these distinct remembrances he wishes that the mind of his pupil should be free to luxuriate in the enjoyments loves and admirations appropriated to its age that he is not in haste to kill what he knows will in due time die of itself or be transmuted and put on a nobler form and higher faculties otherwise unattainable <\s>
<s> in a word that the teacher is governed habitually by the wisdom of patience waiting with pleasure <\s>
<s> yet perceiving how much the outward help of art can facilitate the progress of nature he may be betrayed into many unnecessary or pernicious mistakes where he deems his interference warranted by substantial experience <\s>
<s> and in spite of all his caution remarks may drop insensibly from him which shall wither in the mind of his pupil a generous sympathy destroy a sentiment of approbation or dislike not merely innocent but salutary and for the inexperienced disciple how many pleasures may be thus off what joy what admiration and what love <\s>
<s> while in their stead are introduced into the ingenuous mind misgivings a mistrust of its own evidence dispositions to affect to feel where there can be no real feeling indecisive judgments a superstructure of opinions that has no base to support it and words uttered by rote with the impertinence of a parrot or a mockingbird yet which may not be listened to with the same indifference as they cannot be heard without some feeling of moral disapprobation <\s>
<s> these results i contend whatever may be the benefit to be derived from such an enlightened teacher are in their degree inevitable <\s>
<s> and by this process humility and docile dispositions may exist towards the master endued as he is with the power which personal presence confers but at the same time they will be liable to overstep their due bounds and to degenerate into passiveness and prostration of mind <\s>
<s> this towards him while with respect to other living men nay even to the mighty spirits of past times there may be associated with such weakness a want of modesty and humility <\s>
<s> insensibly may steal in presumption and a habit of sitting in judgment in cases where no sentiment ought to have existed but diffidence or veneration <\s>
<s> such virtues are the sacred attributes of youth its appropriate calling is not to distinguish in the fear of being deceived or degraded not to analyze with scrupulous minuteness but to accumulate in genial confidence its instinct its safety its benefit its glory is to love to admire to feel and to labour <\s>
<s> nature has irrevocably decreed that our prime dependence in all stages of life after infancy and childhood have been passed through nor do i know that this latter ought to be excepted must be upon our own minds and that the way to knowledge shall be long difficult winding and oftentimes returning upon itself <\s>
<s> what has been said is a mere sketch and that only of a part of the interesting country into which we have been led but my correspondent will be able to enter the paths that have been pointed out <\s>
<s> should he do this and advance steadily for a while he needs not fear any deviations from the truth which will be finally injurious to him <\s>
<s> he will not long have his admiration fixed upon unworthy objects he will neither be clogged nor drawn aside by the love of friends or kindred betraying his understanding through his affections he will neither be bowed down by conventional arrangements of manners producing too often a lifeless decency nor will the rock of his spirit wear away in the endless beating of the waves of the world neither will that portion of his own time which he must surrender to labours by which his livelihood is to be earned or his social duties performed be unprofitable to himself indirectly while it is directly useful to others for that time has been primarily surrendered through an act of obedience to a moral law established by himself and therefore he moves them also along the orbit of perfect liberty <\s>
<s> let it be remembered that the advice requested does not relate to the government of the more dangerous passions or to the fundamental principles of right and wrong as acknowledged by the universal conscience of mankind <\s>
<s> i may therefore assure my youthful correspondent if he will endeavour to look into himself in the manner which i have exhorted him to do that in him the wish will be realized to him in due time the prayer granted which was uttered by that living teacher of whom he speaks with gratitude as of a benefactor when in his character of philosophical poet having thought of morality as implying in its essence voluntary obedience and producing the effect of order he transfers in the transport of imagination the law of moral to physical natures and having contemplated through the medium of that order all modes of existence as subservient to one spirit concludes his address to the power of duty in the following words to humbler functions awful power <\s>
<s> i call thee i myself commend unto thy guidance from this hour oh let my weakness have an end <\s>
<s> give unto me made lowly wise the spirit of self sacrifice the confidence of reason give and in the light of truth thy bondman let me live <\s>

<s> my dear sir i am happy to hear of the instructions which you are preparing for parents and feel honoured by your having offered to me such an opportunity of conveying to the public any information i may possess upon the subject but in truth i am so little competent in the present unarranged state of my ideas to write any thing of value that it would be the highest presumption in me to attempt it <\s>
<s> this is not mock modesty but rigorous and sober truth <\s>
<s> as to the case of your own child i will set down a few thoughts which i do not hope will throw much light on your mind but they will show my willingness to do the little that is in my power <\s>
<s> the child being the child of a man like you what i have to say will lie in small compass <\s>
<s> i consider the facts which you mention as indicative of what is commonly called sensibility and of quickness and talent and shall take for granted that they are so you add that the child is too much noticed by grown people and apprehend selfishness <\s>
<s> such a child will almost always be too much noticed and it is scarcely possible entirely to guard against the evil hence vanity and under bad management selfishness of the worst kind <\s>
<s> and true it is that under better and even the best management such constitutions are liable to selfishness not showing itself in the shape of tyranny caprice avarice meanness envy skulking and base self reference but selfishness of a worthier kind yet still rightly called by that name <\s>
<s> what i mean i shall explain afterwards <\s>
<s> vanity is not the necessary or even natural growth of such a temperament quite the contrary <\s>
<s> such a child if neglected and suffered to run wild would probably be entirely free from vanity owing to the liveliness of its feelings and the number of its resources <\s>
<s> it would be by nature independent and sufficient for itself <\s>

<s> nor can there be any need to be sedulous in calling out her affections her own lively enjoyments will do all this for her and also point out what is to be done to her <\s>

<s> my dear sir i am happy to hear of the instructions which you are preparing for parents and feel honoured by your having offered to me such an opportunity of conveying to the public any information i may possess upon the subject but in truth i am so little competent in the present unarranged state of my ideas to write any thing of value that it would be the highest presumption in me to attempt it <\s>
<s> this is not mock modesty but rigorous and sober truth <\s>
<s> as to the case of your own child i will set down a few thoughts which i do not hope will throw much light on your mind but they will show my willingness to do the little that is in my power <\s>
<s> the child being the child of a man like you what i have to say will lie in small compass <\s>
<s> i consider the facts which you mention as indicative of what is commonly called sensibility and of quickness and talent and shall take for granted that they are so you add that the child is too much noticed by grown people and apprehend selfishness <\s>
<s> such a child will almost always be too much noticed and it is scarcely possible entirely to guard against the evil hence vanity and under bad management selfishness of the worst kind <\s>
<s> and true it is that under better and even the best management such constitutions are liable to selfishness not showing itself in the shape of tyranny caprice avarice meanness envy skulking and base self reference but selfishness of a worthier kind yet still rightly called by that name <\s>
<s> what i mean i shall explain afterwards <\s>
<s> vanity is not the necessary or even natural growth of such a temperament quite the contrary <\s>
<s> such a child if neglected and suffered to run wild would probably be entirely free from vanity owing to the liveliness of its feelings and the number of its resources <\s>
<s> it would be by nature independent and sufficient for itself <\s>
<s> but as such children in these times in particular are rarely if ever neglected or rather rarely if ever not far too much noticed it is a hundred to one your child will have more vanity than you could wish <\s>
<s> this is one evil to be guarded against <\s>
<s> formerly indeed till within these few years children were very carelessly brought up at present they too early and too habitually feel their own importance from the solicitude and unremitting attendance which is bestowed upon them <\s>
<s> a child like yours i believe unless under the wisest guidance would prosper most where she was the least noticed and the least made of i mean more than this where she received the least cultivation <\s>
<s> she does not stand in need of the stimulus of praise as much as can benefit her i e as much as her nature requires it will be impossible to withhold from her ); nor of being provoked to exertion or even if she be not injudiciously thwarted to industry <\s>
<s> nor can there be any need to be sedulous in calling out her affections her own lively enjoyments will do all this for her and also point out what is to be done to her <\s>
<s> but take all the pains you can she will be too much noticed <\s>
<s> other evils will also beset her arising more from herself and how are these to be obviated <\s>
<s> but first let us attempt to find what these evils will be <\s>
<s> observe i put all gross mismanagement out of the question and i believe they will then probably be as follows first as mentioned before a considerable portion of vanity <\s>
<s> but if the child be not constrained too much and be left sufficiently to her own pursuits and be not too anxiously tended and have not her mind planted over by art with likings that do not spring naturally up in it this will by the liveliness of her independent enjoyment almost entirely disappear and she will become modest and diffident and being not apt from the same ruling cause i mean the freshness of her own sensations to compare herself with others she will hold herself in too humble estimation <\s>
<s> but she will probably still be selfish and this brings me to the explanation of what i hinted at before viz in what manner she will be selfish <\s>
<s> it appears then to me that all the permanent evils which you have to apprehend for your daughter supposing you should live to educate her yourself may be referred to this principle an undue predominance of present objects over absent ones which as she will surely be distinguished by an extreme love of those about her will produce a certain restlessness of mind calling perpetually for proofs of ever living regard and affection she must be loved as much and in the same way as she loves or she will not be satisfied <\s>
<s> hence quickness in taking offence petty jealousies and apprehensions lest she is neglected or loses ground in people's love a want of a calm and steady sense of her own merits to secure her from these fits of imagined slights for in the first place she will as is hinted at before be in general deficient in this just estimation of her own worth and will further be apt to forget everything of that kind in the present sense of supposed injury <\s>
<s> she will all which is referable to the same cause in the company of others have too constant a craving for sympathy up to a height beyond what her companions are capable of bestowing this will often be mortifying to herself and burthensome to others and should circumstances be untoward and her mind be not sufficiently furnished with ideas and knowledge this craving would be most pernicious to herself preying upon mind and body <\s>
<s> she will be too easily pleased apt to overrate the merits of new acquaintances subject to fits of over love and over joy in absence from those she loves full of fears and apprehensions c injurious to her health her passions for the most part will be happy and good but she will be too little mistress of them <\s>
<s> the distinctions which her intellect will make will be apt able and just but in conversation she will be prone to overshoot herself and commit eloquent blunders through eagerness <\s>
<s> in fine her manners will be frank and ardent but they will want dignity and a want of dignity will be the general defect of her character <\s>
<s> something of this sort of character which i have thus loosely sketched and something of the sort of selfishness to which i have adverted it seems to me that under the best management you have reason to apprehend for your daughter <\s>
<s> if she should happen to be an only child or the only sister of brothers who would probably idolize her one might prophesy almost with absolute confidence that most of these qualities would be found in her in a great degree <\s>
<s> how then is the evil to be softened down or prevented <\s>
<s> assuredly not by mortifying her which is the course commonly pursued with such tempers nor by preaching to her about her own defects nor by overrunning her infancy with books about good boys and girls and bad boys and girls and all that trumpery but and this is the only important thing i have to say upon the subject by putting her in the way of acquiring without measure or limit such knowledge as will lead her out of herself such knowledge as is interesting for its own sake things known because they are interesting not interesting because they are known in a word by leaving her at liberty to luxuriate in such feelings and images as will feed her mind in silent pleasure <\s>
<s> this nourishment is contained in fairy tales romances the best biographies and histories and such parts of natural history relating to the powers and appearances of the earth and elements and the habits and structure of animals as belong to it not as an art or science but as a magazine of form and feeling <\s>
<s> this kind of knowledge is purely good a direct antidote to every evil to be apprehended and food absolutely necessary to preserve the mind of a child like yours from morbid appetites <\s>
<s> next to these objects comes such knowledge as while it is chiefly interesting for its own sake admits the fellowship of another sort of pleasure that of complacence from the conscious exertion of the faculties and love of praise <\s>
<s> the accomplishments of dancing music and drawing rank under this head grammar learning of languages botany probably and out of the way knowledge of arts and manufactures c <\s>
<s> the second class of objects as far as they tend to feed vanity and self conceit are evil but let them have their just proportion in the plan of education and they will afterwards contribute to destroy these by furnishing the mind with power and independent gratification the vanity will disappear and the good will remain <\s>
<s> lastly comes that class of objects which are interesting almost solely because they are known and the knowledge may be displayed and this unfortunately comprehends three fourths of what according to the plan of modern education children's heads are stuffed with that is minute remote or trifling facts in geography topography natural history chronology c or acquisitions in art or accomplishments which the child makes by rote and which are quite beyond its age things of no value in themselves but as they show cleverness things hurtful to any temper but to a child like yours absolute poison <\s>
<s> having said thus much it seems almost impertinent to add that your child above all should i might say be chained down to the severest attention to truth i mean to the minutest accuracy in every thing which she relates this will strike at the root of evil by teaching her to form correct notions of present things and will steadily strengthen her mind <\s>
<s> much caution should be taken not to damp her natural vivacity for this may have a very bad effect and by the indirect influence of the example of manly and dignified manners any excessive wildnesses of her own will be best kept under <\s>
<s> most unrelaxing firmness should from the present hour be maintained in withstanding such of her desires as are grossly unreasonable <\s>
<s> in those words it was his purpose to censure that barren contemplation which rests satisfied with itself in cases where the thoughts are of such quality that they may and ought to be embodied in action <\s>
<s> but he speaks now of the general superiority of thought to action as proceeding and governing all action that moves to salutary purposes and secondly as leading to elevation the absolute possession of the individual mind and to a consistency or harmony of the being within itself which no outward agency can reach to disturb or to impair and lastly as producing works of pure science or of the combined faculties of imagination feeling and reason works which both from their independence in their origin upon accident their nature their duration and the wide spread of their influence are entitled rightly to take place of the noblest and most beneficent deeds of heroes statesmen legislators or warriors <\s>
<s> yet beginning from the perception of this established superiority we do not suppose that the youth whom we wish to guide and encourage is to be insensible to those influences of wealth or rank or station by which the bulk of mankind are swayed <\s>
<s> our eyes have not been fixed upon virtue which lies apart from human nature or transcends it <\s>
<s> in fact there is no such virtue <\s>
<s> we neither suppose nor wish him to undervalue or slight these distinctions as modes of power things that may enable him to be more useful to his contemporaries nor as gratifications that may confer dignity upon his living person and through him upon those who love him nor as they may connect his name through a family to be founded by his success in a closer chain of gratitude with some portion of posterity who shall speak of him as among their ancestry with a more tender interest than the mere general bond of patriotism or humanity would supply <\s>
<s> we suppose no indifference to much less a contempt of these rewards but let them have their due place let it be ascertained when the soul is searched into that they are only an auxiliary motive to exertion never the principal or originating force <\s>
<s> if this be too much to expect from a youth who i take for granted possesses no ordinary endowments and whom circumstances with respect to the more dangerous passions have favoured then indeed must the noble spirit of the country be wasted away then would our institutions be deplorable and the education prevalent among us utterly vile and debasing <\s>
<s> but my correspondent who drew forth these thoughts has said rightly that the character of the age may not without injustice be thus branded <\s>
<s> he will not deny that without speaking of other countries there is in these islands in the departments of natural philosophy of mechanic ingenuity in the general activities of the country and in the particular excellence of individual minds in high stations civil or military enough to excite admiration and love in the sober minded and more than enough to intoxicate the youthful and inexperienced <\s>
<s> i will compare then an aspiring youth leaving the schools in which he has been disciplined and preparing to bear a part in the concerns of the world i will compare him in this season of eager admiration to a newly invested knight appearing with his blank unsignalized shield upon some day of solemn tournament at the court of the faery queen as that sovereignty was conceived to exist by the moral and imaginative genius of our divine spenser <\s>
<s> he does not himself immediately enter the lists as a combatant but he looks round him with a beating heart dazzled by the gorgeous pageantry the banners the impresses the ladies of overcoming beauty the persons of the knights now first seen by him the fame of whose actions is carried by the traveller like merchandize through the world and resounded upon the harp of the minstrel <\s>
<s> but i am not at liberty to make this comparison <\s>
<s> if a youth were to begin his career in such an assemblage with such examples to guide and to animate it will be pleaded there would be no cause for apprehension he could not falter he could not be misled <\s>
<s> but ours is notwithstanding its manifold excellences a degenerate age and recreant knights are among us far outnumbering the true <\s>
<s> a false gloriana in these days imposes worthless services which they who perform them in their blindness know not to be such and which are recompensed by rewards as worthless yet eagerly grasped at as if they were the immortal guerdon of virtue <\s>
<s> i have in this declaration insensibly overstepped the limits which i had determined not to pass let me be forgiven for it is hope which hath carried me forward <\s>
<s> in such a mixed assemblage as our age presents with its genuine merit and its large overbalance of alloy i may boldly ask into what errors either with respect to person or thing could a young man fall who had sincerely entered upon the course of moral discipline which has been recommended and to which the condition of youth it has been proved is favourable <\s>
<s> his opinions could no where deceive him beyond the point up to which after a season he would find that it was salutary for him to have been deceived <\s>
<s> for as that man cannot set a right value upon health who has never known sickness nor feel the blessing of ease who has been through his life a stranger to pain so can there be no confirmed and passionate love of truth for him who has not experienced the hollowness of error <\s>
<s> range against each other as advocates oppose as combatants two several intellects each strenuously asserting doctrines which he sincerely believes but the one contending for the worth and beauty of that garment which the other has outgrown and cast away <\s>
<s> mark the superiority the ease the dignity on the side of the more advanced mind how he overlooks his subject commands it from centre to circumference and hath the same thorough knowledge of the tenets which his adversary with impetuous zeal but in confusion also and thrown off his guard at every turn of the argument is labouring to maintain <\s>
<s> if it be a question of the fine arts poetry for instance the riper mind not only sees that his opponent is deceived but what is of far more importance sees how he is deceived <\s>
<s> the imagination stands before him with all its imperfections laid open as duped by shows enslaved by words corrupted by mistaken delicacy and false refinement as not having even attended with care to the reports of the senses and therefore deficient grossly in the rudiments of its own power <\s>
<s> he has noted how as a supposed necessary condition the understanding sleeps in order that the fancy may dream <\s>
<s> studied in the history of society and versed in the secret laws of thought he can pass regularly through all the gradations can pierce infallibly all the windings which false taste through ages has pursued from the very time when first through inexperience heedlessness or affectation the imagination took its departure from the side of truth its original parent <\s>
<s> can a disputant thus accoutred be withstood one to whom further every movement in the thoughts of his antagonist is revealed by the light of his own experience who therefore sympathizes with weakness gently and wins his way by forbearance and hath when needful an irresistible power of onset arising from gratitude to the truth which he vindicates not merely as a positive good for mankind but as his own especial rescue and redemption <\s>
<s> i might here conclude but my correspondent towards the close of his letter has written so feelingly upon the advantages to be derived in his estimation from a living instructor that i must not leave this part of the subject without a word of direct notice <\s>
<s> the friend cited some time ago 28 a passage from the prose works of milton eloquently describing the manner in which good and evil grow up together in the field of the world almost inseparably and insisting consequently upon the knowledge and survey of vice as necessary to the constituting of human virtue and the scanning of error to the confirmation of truth <\s>

<s> letter to a friend 1806 <\s>
<s> my dear sir i am happy to hear of the instructions which you are preparing for parents and feel honoured by your having offered to me such an opportunity of conveying to the public any information i may possess upon the subject but in truth i am so little competent in the present unarranged state of my ideas to write any thing of value that it would be the highest presumption in me to attempt it <\s>
<s> this is not mock modesty but rigorous and sober truth <\s>
<s> as to the case of your own child i will set down a few thoughts which i do not hope will throw much light on your mind but they will show my willingness to do the little that is in my power <\s>
<s> the child being the child of a man like you what i have to say will lie in small compass <\s>
<s> i consider the facts which you mention as indicative of what is commonly called sensibility and of quickness and talent and shall take for granted that they are so you add that the child is too much noticed by grown people and apprehend selfishness <\s>
<s> such a child will almost always be too much noticed and it is scarcely possible entirely to guard against the evil hence vanity and under bad management selfishness of the worst kind <\s>
<s> and true it is that under better and even the best management such constitutions are liable to selfishness not showing itself in the shape of tyranny caprice avarice meanness envy skulking and base self reference but selfishness of a worthier kind yet still rightly called by that name <\s>
<s> what i mean i shall explain afterwards <\s>
<s> vanity is not the necessary or even natural growth of such a temperament quite the contrary <\s>
<s> such a child if neglected and suffered to run wild would probably be entirely free from vanity owing to the liveliness of its feelings and the number of its resources <\s>
<s> it would be by nature independent and sufficient for itself <\s>
<s> but as such children in these times in particular are rarely if ever neglected or rather rarely if ever not far too much noticed it is a hundred to one your child will have more vanity than you could wish <\s>
<s> this is one evil to be guarded against <\s>
<s> formerly indeed till within these few years children were very carelessly brought up at present they too early and too habitually feel their own importance from the solicitude and unremitting attendance which is bestowed upon them <\s>
<s> a child like yours i believe unless under the wisest guidance would prosper most where she was the least noticed and the least made of i mean more than this where she received the least cultivation <\s>
<s> she does not stand in need of the stimulus of praise as much as can benefit her i e as much as her nature requires it will be impossible to withhold from her ); nor of being provoked to exertion or even if she be not injudiciously thwarted to industry <\s>
<s> nor can there be any need to be sedulous in calling out her affections her own lively enjoyments will do all this for her and also point out what is to be done to her <\s>
<s> but take all the pains you can she will be too much noticed <\s>
<s> other evils will also beset her arising more from herself and how are these to be obviated <\s>
<s> but first let us attempt to find what these evils will be <\s>
<s> observe i put all gross mismanagement out of the question and i believe they will then probably be as follows first as mentioned before a considerable portion of vanity <\s>
<s> but if the child be not constrained too much and be left sufficiently to her own pursuits and be not too anxiously tended and have not her mind planted over by art with likings that do not spring naturally up in it this will by the liveliness of her independent enjoyment almost entirely disappear and she will become modest and diffident and being not apt from the same ruling cause i mean the freshness of her own sensations to compare herself with others she will hold herself in too humble estimation <\s>
<s> but she will probably still be selfish and this brings me to the explanation of what i hinted at before viz in what manner she will be selfish <\s>
<s> it appears then to me that all the permanent evils which you have to apprehend for your daughter supposing you should live to educate her yourself may be referred to this principle an undue predominance of present objects over absent ones which as she will surely be distinguished by an extreme love of those about her will produce a certain restlessness of mind calling perpetually for proofs of ever living regard and affection she must be loved as much and in the same way as she loves or she will not be satisfied <\s>
<s> hence quickness in taking offence petty jealousies and apprehensions lest she is neglected or loses ground in people's love a want of a calm and steady sense of her own merits to secure her from these fits of imagined slights for in the first place she will as is hinted at before be in general deficient in this just estimation of her own worth and will further be apt to forget everything of that kind in the present sense of supposed injury <\s>
<s> she will all which is referable to the same cause in the company of others have too constant a craving for sympathy up to a height beyond what her companions are capable of bestowing this will often be mortifying to herself and burthensome to others and should circumstances be untoward and her mind be not sufficiently furnished with ideas and knowledge this craving would be most pernicious to herself preying upon mind and body <\s>
<s> she will be too easily pleased apt to overrate the merits of new acquaintances subject to fits of over love and over joy in absence from those she loves full of fears and apprehensions c injurious to her health her passions for the most part will be happy and good but she will be too little mistress of them <\s>
<s> the distinctions which her intellect will make will be apt able and just but in conversation she will be prone to overshoot herself and commit eloquent blunders through eagerness <\s>
<s> in fine her manners will be frank and ardent but they will want dignity and a want of dignity will be the general defect of her character <\s>
<s> something of this sort of character which i have thus loosely sketched and something of the sort of selfishness to which i have adverted it seems to me that under the best management you have reason to apprehend for your daughter <\s>
<s> if she should happen to be an only child or the only sister of brothers who would probably idolize her one might prophesy almost with absolute confidence that most of these qualities would be found in her in a great degree <\s>
<s> how then is the evil to be softened down or prevented <\s>
<s> assuredly not by mortifying her which is the course commonly pursued with such tempers nor by preaching to her about her own defects nor by overrunning her infancy with books about good boys and girls and bad boys and girls and all that trumpery but and this is the only important thing i have to say upon the subject by putting her in the way of acquiring without measure or limit such knowledge as will lead her out of herself such knowledge as is interesting for its own sake things known because they are interesting not interesting because they are known in a word by leaving her at liberty to luxuriate in such feelings and images as will feed her mind in silent pleasure <\s>
<s> this nourishment is contained in fairy tales romances the best biographies and histories and such parts of natural history relating to the powers and appearances of the earth and elements and the habits and structure of animals as belong to it not as an art or science but as a magazine of form and feeling <\s>
<s> this kind of knowledge is purely good a direct antidote to every evil to be apprehended and food absolutely necessary to preserve the mind of a child like yours from morbid appetites <\s>
<s> next to these objects comes such knowledge as while it is chiefly interesting for its own sake admits the fellowship of another sort of pleasure that of complacence from the conscious exertion of the faculties and love of praise <\s>
<s> the accomplishments of dancing music and drawing rank under this head grammar learning of languages botany probably and out of the way knowledge of arts and manufactures c <\s>
<s> the second class of objects as far as they tend to feed vanity and self conceit are evil but let them have their just proportion in the plan of education and they will afterwards contribute to destroy these by furnishing the mind with power and independent gratification the vanity will disappear and the good will remain <\s>
<s> lastly comes that class of objects which are interesting almost solely because they are known and the knowledge may be displayed and this unfortunately comprehends three fourths of what according to the plan of modern education children's heads are stuffed with that is minute remote or trifling facts in geography topography natural history chronology c or acquisitions in art or accomplishments which the child makes by rote and which are quite beyond its age things of no value in themselves but as they show cleverness things hurtful to any temper but to a child like yours absolute poison <\s>
<s> having said thus much it seems almost impertinent to add that your child above all should i might say be chained down to the severest attention to truth i mean to the minutest accuracy in every thing which she relates this will strike at the root of evil by teaching her to form correct notions of present things and will steadily strengthen her mind <\s>
<s> much caution should be taken not to damp her natural vivacity for this may have a very bad effect and by the indirect influence of the example of manly and dignified manners any excessive wildnesses of her own will be best kept under <\s>
<s> most unrelaxing firmness should from the present hour be maintained in withstanding such of her desires as are grossly unreasonable <\s>
<s> in those words it was his purpose to censure that barren contemplation which rests satisfied with itself in cases where the thoughts are of such quality that they may and ought to be embodied in action <\s>
<s> but he speaks now of the general superiority of thought to action as proceeding and governing all action that moves to salutary purposes and secondly as leading to elevation the absolute possession of the individual mind and to a consistency or harmony of the being within itself which no outward agency can reach to disturb or to impair and lastly as producing works of pure science or of the combined faculties of imagination feeling and reason works which both from their independence in their origin upon accident their nature their duration and the wide spread of their influence are entitled rightly to take place of the noblest and most beneficent deeds of heroes statesmen legislators or warriors <\s>

<s> my dear sir i am happy to hear of the instructions which you are preparing for parents and feel honoured by your having offered to me such an opportunity of conveying to the public any information i may possess upon the subject but in truth i am so little competent in the present unarranged state of my ideas to write any thing of value that it would be the highest presumption in me to attempt it <\s>
<s> this is not mock modesty but rigorous and sober truth <\s>
<s> as to the case of your own child i will set down a few thoughts which i do not hope will throw much light on your mind but they will show my willingness to do the little that is in my power <\s>
<s> the child being the child of a man like you what i have to say will lie in small compass <\s>
<s> i consider the facts which you mention as indicative of what is commonly called sensibility and of quickness and talent and shall take for granted that they are so you add that the child is too much noticed by grown people and apprehend selfishness <\s>
<s> such a child will almost always be too much noticed and it is scarcely possible entirely to guard against the evil hence vanity and under bad management selfishness of the worst kind <\s>
<s> and true it is that under better and even the best management such constitutions are liable to selfishness not showing itself in the shape of tyranny caprice avarice meanness envy skulking and base self reference but selfishness of a worthier kind yet still rightly called by that name <\s>
<s> what i mean i shall explain afterwards <\s>
<s> vanity is not the necessary or even natural growth of such a temperament quite the contrary <\s>
<s> such a child if neglected and suffered to run wild would probably be entirely free from vanity owing to the liveliness of its feelings and the number of its resources <\s>
<s> it would be by nature independent and sufficient for itself <\s>
<s> but as such children in these times in particular are rarely if ever neglected or rather rarely if ever not far too much noticed it is a hundred to one your child will have more vanity than you could wish <\s>
<s> this is one evil to be guarded against <\s>
<s> formerly indeed till within these few years children were very carelessly brought up at present they too early and too habitually feel their own importance from the solicitude and unremitting attendance which is bestowed upon them <\s>
<s> a child like yours i believe unless under the wisest guidance would prosper most where she was the least noticed and the least made of i mean more than this where she received the least cultivation <\s>
<s> she does not stand in need of the stimulus of praise as much as can benefit her i e as much as her nature requires it will be impossible to withhold from her ); nor of being provoked to exertion or even if she be not injudiciously thwarted to industry <\s>
<s> nor can there be any need to be sedulous in calling out her affections her own lively enjoyments will do all this for her and also point out what is to be done to her <\s>
<s> but take all the pains you can she will be too much noticed <\s>
<s> other evils will also beset her arising more from herself and how are these to be obviated <\s>
<s> but first let us attempt to find what these evils will be <\s>
<s> observe i put all gross mismanagement out of the question and i believe they will then probably be as follows first as mentioned before a considerable portion of vanity <\s>
<s> but if the child be not constrained too much and be left sufficiently to her own pursuits and be not too anxiously tended and have not her mind planted over by art with likings that do not spring naturally up in it this will by the liveliness of her independent enjoyment almost entirely disappear and she will become modest and diffident and being not apt from the same ruling cause i mean the freshness of her own sensations to compare herself with others she will hold herself in too humble estimation <\s>
<s> but she will probably still be selfish and this brings me to the explanation of what i hinted at before viz in what manner she will be selfish <\s>
<s> it appears then to me that all the permanent evils which you have to apprehend for your daughter supposing you should live to educate her yourself may be referred to this principle an undue predominance of present objects over absent ones which as she will surely be distinguished by an extreme love of those about her will produce a certain restlessness of mind calling perpetually for proofs of ever living regard and affection she must be loved as much and in the same way as she loves or she will not be satisfied <\s>
<s> hence quickness in taking offence petty jealousies and apprehensions lest she is neglected or loses ground in people's love a want of a calm and steady sense of her own merits to secure her from these fits of imagined slights for in the first place she will as is hinted at before be in general deficient in this just estimation of her own worth and will further be apt to forget everything of that kind in the present sense of supposed injury <\s>
<s> she will all which is referable to the same cause in the company of others have too constant a craving for sympathy up to a height beyond what her companions are capable of bestowing this will often be mortifying to herself and burthensome to others and should circumstances be untoward and her mind be not sufficiently furnished with ideas and knowledge this craving would be most pernicious to herself preying upon mind and body <\s>
<s> she will be too easily pleased apt to overrate the merits of new acquaintances subject to fits of over love and over joy in absence from those she loves full of fears and apprehensions c injurious to her health her passions for the most part will be happy and good but she will be too little mistress of them <\s>
<s> the distinctions which her intellect will make will be apt able and just but in conversation she will be prone to overshoot herself and commit eloquent blunders through eagerness <\s>
<s> in fine her manners will be frank and ardent but they will want dignity and a want of dignity will be the general defect of her character <\s>
<s> something of this sort of character which i have thus loosely sketched and something of the sort of selfishness to which i have adverted it seems to me that under the best management you have reason to apprehend for your daughter <\s>
<s> if she should happen to be an only child or the only sister of brothers who would probably idolize her one might prophesy almost with absolute confidence that most of these qualities would be found in her in a great degree <\s>
<s> how then is the evil to be softened down or prevented <\s>
<s> assuredly not by mortifying her which is the course commonly pursued with such tempers nor by preaching to her about her own defects nor by overrunning her infancy with books about good boys and girls and bad boys and girls and all that trumpery but and this is the only important thing i have to say upon the subject by putting her in the way of acquiring without measure or limit such knowledge as will lead her out of herself such knowledge as is interesting for its own sake things known because they are interesting not interesting because they are known in a word by leaving her at liberty to luxuriate in such feelings and images as will feed her mind in silent pleasure <\s>
<s> this nourishment is contained in fairy tales romances the best biographies and histories and such parts of natural history relating to the powers and appearances of the earth and elements and the habits and structure of animals as belong to it not as an art or science but as a magazine of form and feeling <\s>
<s> this kind of knowledge is purely good a direct antidote to every evil to be apprehended and food absolutely necessary to preserve the mind of a child like yours from morbid appetites <\s>
<s> next to these objects comes such knowledge as while it is chiefly interesting for its own sake admits the fellowship of another sort of pleasure that of complacence from the conscious exertion of the faculties and love of praise <\s>
<s> the accomplishments of dancing music and drawing rank under this head grammar learning of languages botany probably and out of the way knowledge of arts and manufactures c <\s>
<s> the second class of objects as far as they tend to feed vanity and self conceit are evil but let them have their just proportion in the plan of education and they will afterwards contribute to destroy these by furnishing the mind with power and independent gratification the vanity will disappear and the good will remain <\s>
<s> lastly comes that class of objects which are interesting almost solely because they are known and the knowledge may be displayed and this unfortunately comprehends three fourths of what according to the plan of modern education children's heads are stuffed with that is minute remote or trifling facts in geography topography natural history chronology c or acquisitions in art or accomplishments which the child makes by rote and which are quite beyond its age things of no value in themselves but as they show cleverness things hurtful to any temper but to a child like yours absolute poison <\s>
<s> having said thus much it seems almost impertinent to add that your child above all should i might say be chained down to the severest attention to truth i mean to the minutest accuracy in every thing which she relates this will strike at the root of evil by teaching her to form correct notions of present things and will steadily strengthen her mind <\s>
<s> much caution should be taken not to damp her natural vivacity for this may have a very bad effect and by the indirect influence of the example of manly and dignified manners any excessive wildnesses of her own will be best kept under <\s>
<s> most unrelaxing firmness should from the present hour be maintained in withstanding such of her desires as are grossly unreasonable <\s>
<s> in those words it was his purpose to censure that barren contemplation which rests satisfied with itself in cases where the thoughts are of such quality that they may and ought to be embodied in action <\s>
<s> but he speaks now of the general superiority of thought to action as proceeding and governing all action that moves to salutary purposes and secondly as leading to elevation the absolute possession of the individual mind and to a consistency or harmony of the being within itself which no outward agency can reach to disturb or to impair and lastly as producing works of pure science or of the combined faculties of imagination feeling and reason works which both from their independence in their origin upon accident their nature their duration and the wide spread of their influence are entitled rightly to take place of the noblest and most beneficent deeds of heroes statesmen legislators or warriors <\s>
<s> yet beginning from the perception of this established superiority we do not suppose that the youth whom we wish to guide and encourage is to be insensible to those influences of wealth or rank or station by which the bulk of mankind are swayed <\s>
<s> our eyes have not been fixed upon virtue which lies apart from human nature or transcends it <\s>
<s> in fact there is no such virtue <\s>
<s> we neither suppose nor wish him to undervalue or slight these distinctions as modes of power things that may enable him to be more useful to his contemporaries nor as gratifications that may confer dignity upon his living person and through him upon those who love him nor as they may connect his name through a family to be founded by his success in a closer chain of gratitude with some portion of posterity who shall speak of him as among their ancestry with a more tender interest than the mere general bond of patriotism or humanity would supply <\s>
<s> we suppose no indifference to much less a contempt of these rewards but let them have their due place let it be ascertained when the soul is searched into that they are only an auxiliary motive to exertion never the principal or originating force <\s>
<s> if this be too much to expect from a youth who i take for granted possesses no ordinary endowments and whom circumstances with respect to the more dangerous passions have favoured then indeed must the noble spirit of the country be wasted away then would our institutions be deplorable and the education prevalent among us utterly vile and debasing <\s>
<s> but my correspondent who drew forth these thoughts has said rightly that the character of the age may not without injustice be thus branded <\s>
<s> he will not deny that without speaking of other countries there is in these islands in the departments of natural philosophy of mechanic ingenuity in the general activities of the country and in the particular excellence of individual minds in high stations civil or military enough to excite admiration and love in the sober minded and more than enough to intoxicate the youthful and inexperienced <\s>
<s> i will compare then an aspiring youth leaving the schools in which he has been disciplined and preparing to bear a part in the concerns of the world i will compare him in this season of eager admiration to a newly invested knight appearing with his blank unsignalized shield upon some day of solemn tournament at the court of the faery queen as that sovereignty was conceived to exist by the moral and imaginative genius of our divine spenser <\s>
<s> he does not himself immediately enter the lists as a combatant but he looks round him with a beating heart dazzled by the gorgeous pageantry the banners the impresses the ladies of overcoming beauty the persons of the knights now first seen by him the fame of whose actions is carried by the traveller like merchandize through the world and resounded upon the harp of the minstrel <\s>
<s> but i am not at liberty to make this comparison <\s>
<s> if a youth were to begin his career in such an assemblage with such examples to guide and to animate it will be pleaded there would be no cause for apprehension he could not falter he could not be misled <\s>
<s> but ours is notwithstanding its manifold excellences a degenerate age and recreant knights are among us far outnumbering the true <\s>
<s> a false gloriana in these days imposes worthless services which they who perform them in their blindness know not to be such and which are recompensed by rewards as worthless yet eagerly grasped at as if they were the immortal guerdon of virtue <\s>
<s> i have in this declaration insensibly overstepped the limits which i had determined not to pass let me be forgiven for it is hope which hath carried me forward <\s>
<s> in such a mixed assemblage as our age presents with its genuine merit and its large overbalance of alloy i may boldly ask into what errors either with respect to person or thing could a young man fall who had sincerely entered upon the course of moral discipline which has been recommended and to which the condition of youth it has been proved is favourable <\s>
<s> his opinions could no where deceive him beyond the point up to which after a season he would find that it was salutary for him to have been deceived <\s>
<s> for as that man cannot set a right value upon health who has never known sickness nor feel the blessing of ease who has been through his life a stranger to pain so can there be no confirmed and passionate love of truth for him who has not experienced the hollowness of error <\s>
<s> range against each other as advocates oppose as combatants two several intellects each strenuously asserting doctrines which he sincerely believes but the one contending for the worth and beauty of that garment which the other has outgrown and cast away <\s>
<s> mark the superiority the ease the dignity on the side of the more advanced mind how he overlooks his subject commands it from centre to circumference and hath the same thorough knowledge of the tenets which his adversary with impetuous zeal but in confusion also and thrown off his guard at every turn of the argument is labouring to maintain <\s>
<s> if it be a question of the fine arts poetry for instance the riper mind not only sees that his opponent is deceived but what is of far more importance sees how he is deceived <\s>
<s> the imagination stands before him with all its imperfections laid open as duped by shows enslaved by words corrupted by mistaken delicacy and false refinement as not having even attended with care to the reports of the senses and therefore deficient grossly in the rudiments of its own power <\s>
<s> he has noted how as a supposed necessary condition the understanding sleeps in order that the fancy may dream <\s>
<s> studied in the history of society and versed in the secret laws of thought he can pass regularly through all the gradations can pierce infallibly all the windings which false taste through ages has pursued from the very time when first through inexperience heedlessness or affectation the imagination took its departure from the side of truth its original parent <\s>
<s> can a disputant thus accoutred be withstood one to whom further every movement in the thoughts of his antagonist is revealed by the light of his own experience who therefore sympathizes with weakness gently and wins his way by forbearance and hath when needful an irresistible power of onset arising from gratitude to the truth which he vindicates not merely as a positive good for mankind but as his own especial rescue and redemption <\s>
<s> i might here conclude but my correspondent towards the close of his letter has written so feelingly upon the advantages to be derived in his estimation from a living instructor that i must not leave this part of the subject without a word of direct notice <\s>
<s> the friend cited some time ago 28 a passage from the prose works of milton eloquently describing the manner in which good and evil grow up together in the field of the world almost inseparably and insisting consequently upon the knowledge and survey of vice as necessary to the constituting of human virtue and the scanning of error to the confirmation of truth <\s>
<s> 28 the friend vol <\s>
<s> if this be so and i have been reasoning to the same effect in the preceding paragraph the fact and the thoughts which it may suggest will if rightly applied tend to moderate an anxiety for the guidance of a more experienced or superior mind <\s>
<s> the advantage where it is possessed is far from being an absolute good nay such a preceptor ever at hand might prove an oppression not to be thrown off and a fatal hindrance <\s>
<s> grant that in the general tenor of his intercourse with his pupil he is forbearing and circumspect inasmuch as he is rich in that knowledge above all other necessary for a teacher which cannot exist without a liveliness of memory preserving for him an unbroken image of the winding excursive and often retrograde course along which his own intellect has passed <\s>
<s> grant that furnished with these distinct remembrances he wishes that the mind of his pupil should be free to luxuriate in the enjoyments loves and admirations appropriated to its age that he is not in haste to kill what he knows will in due time die of itself or be transmuted and put on a nobler form and higher faculties otherwise unattainable <\s>
<s> in a word that the teacher is governed habitually by the wisdom of patience waiting with pleasure <\s>
<s> yet perceiving how much the outward help of art can facilitate the progress of nature he may be betrayed into many unnecessary or pernicious mistakes where he deems his interference warranted by substantial experience <\s>
<s> and in spite of all his caution remarks may drop insensibly from him which shall wither in the mind of his pupil a generous sympathy destroy a sentiment of approbation or dislike not merely innocent but salutary and for the inexperienced disciple how many pleasures may be thus off what joy what admiration and what love <\s>
<s> while in their stead are introduced into the ingenuous mind misgivings a mistrust of its own evidence dispositions to affect to feel where there can be no real feeling indecisive judgments a superstructure of opinions that has no base to support it and words uttered by rote with the impertinence of a parrot or a mockingbird yet which may not be listened to with the same indifference as they cannot be heard without some feeling of moral disapprobation <\s>
<s> these results i contend whatever may be the benefit to be derived from such an enlightened teacher are in their degree inevitable <\s>
<s> and by this process humility and docile dispositions may exist towards the master endued as he is with the power which personal presence confers but at the same time they will be liable to overstep their due bounds and to degenerate into passiveness and prostration of mind <\s>
<s> this towards him while with respect to other living men nay even to the mighty spirits of past times there may be associated with such weakness a want of modesty and humility <\s>
<s> insensibly may steal in presumption and a habit of sitting in judgment in cases where no sentiment ought to have existed but diffidence or veneration <\s>
<s> such virtues are the sacred attributes of youth its appropriate calling is not to distinguish in the fear of being deceived or degraded not to analyze with scrupulous minuteness but to accumulate in genial confidence its instinct its safety its benefit its glory is to love to admire to feel and to labour <\s>
<s> nature has irrevocably decreed that our prime dependence in all stages of life after infancy and childhood have been passed through nor do i know that this latter ought to be excepted must be upon our own minds and that the way to knowledge shall be long difficult winding and oftentimes returning upon itself <\s>
<s> what has been said is a mere sketch and that only of a part of the interesting country into which we have been led but my correspondent will be able to enter the paths that have been pointed out <\s>
<s> should he do this and advance steadily for a while he needs not fear any deviations from the truth which will be finally injurious to him <\s>
<s> he will not long have his admiration fixed upon unworthy objects he will neither be clogged nor drawn aside by the love of friends or kindred betraying his understanding through his affections he will neither be bowed down by conventional arrangements of manners producing too often a lifeless decency nor will the rock of his spirit wear away in the endless beating of the waves of the world neither will that portion of his own time which he must surrender to labours by which his livelihood is to be earned or his social duties performed be unprofitable to himself indirectly while it is directly useful to others for that time has been primarily surrendered through an act of obedience to a moral law established by himself and therefore he moves them also along the orbit of perfect liberty <\s>

<s> my dear sir i am happy to hear of the instructions which you are preparing for parents and feel honoured by your having offered to me such an opportunity of conveying to the public any information i may possess upon the subject but in truth i am so little competent in the present unarranged state of my ideas to write any thing of value that it would be the highest presumption in me to attempt it <\s>
<s> this is not mock modesty but rigorous and sober truth <\s>
<s> as to the case of your own child i will set down a few thoughts which i do not hope will throw much light on your mind but they will show my willingness to do the little that is in my power <\s>
<s> the child being the child of a man like you what i have to say will lie in small compass <\s>
<s> i consider the facts which you mention as indicative of what is commonly called sensibility and of quickness and talent and shall take for granted that they are so you add that the child is too much noticed by grown people and apprehend selfishness <\s>
<s> such a child will almost always be too much noticed and it is scarcely possible entirely to guard against the evil hence vanity and under bad management selfishness of the worst kind <\s>
<s> and true it is that under better and even the best management such constitutions are liable to selfishness not showing itself in the shape of tyranny caprice avarice meanness envy skulking and base self reference but selfishness of a worthier kind yet still rightly called by that name <\s>
<s> what i mean i shall explain afterwards <\s>
<s> vanity is not the necessary or even natural growth of such a temperament quite the contrary <\s>
<s> such a child if neglected and suffered to run wild would probably be entirely free from vanity owing to the liveliness of its feelings and the number of its resources <\s>
<s> it would be by nature independent and sufficient for itself <\s>
<s> but as such children in these times in particular are rarely if ever neglected or rather rarely if ever not far too much noticed it is a hundred to one your child will have more vanity than you could wish <\s>
<s> this is one evil to be guarded against <\s>
<s> formerly indeed till within these few years children were very carelessly brought up at present they too early and too habitually feel their own importance from the solicitude and unremitting attendance which is bestowed upon them <\s>
<s> a child like yours i believe unless under the wisest guidance would prosper most where she was the least noticed and the least made of i mean more than this where she received the least cultivation <\s>
<s> she does not stand in need of the stimulus of praise as much as can benefit her i e as much as her nature requires it will be impossible to withhold from her ); nor of being provoked to exertion or even if she be not injudiciously thwarted to industry <\s>
<s> nor can there be any need to be sedulous in calling out her affections her own lively enjoyments will do all this for her and also point out what is to be done to her <\s>
<s> but take all the pains you can she will be too much noticed <\s>
<s> other evils will also beset her arising more from herself and how are these to be obviated <\s>
<s> but first let us attempt to find what these evils will be <\s>
<s> observe i put all gross mismanagement out of the question and i believe they will then probably be as follows first as mentioned before a considerable portion of vanity <\s>
<s> but if the child be not constrained too much and be left sufficiently to her own pursuits and be not too anxiously tended and have not her mind planted over by art with likings that do not spring naturally up in it this will by the liveliness of her independent enjoyment almost entirely disappear and she will become modest and diffident and being not apt from the same ruling cause i mean the freshness of her own sensations to compare herself with others she will hold herself in too humble estimation <\s>
<s> but she will probably still be selfish and this brings me to the explanation of what i hinted at before viz in what manner she will be selfish <\s>
<s> it appears then to me that all the permanent evils which you have to apprehend for your daughter supposing you should live to educate her yourself may be referred to this principle an undue predominance of present objects over absent ones which as she will surely be distinguished by an extreme love of those about her will produce a certain restlessness of mind calling perpetually for proofs of ever living regard and affection she must be loved as much and in the same way as she loves or she will not be satisfied <\s>
<s> hence quickness in taking offence petty jealousies and apprehensions lest she is neglected or loses ground in people's love a want of a calm and steady sense of her own merits to secure her from these fits of imagined slights for in the first place she will as is hinted at before be in general deficient in this just estimation of her own worth and will further be apt to forget everything of that kind in the present sense of supposed injury <\s>
<s> she will all which is referable to the same cause in the company of others have too constant a craving for sympathy up to a height beyond what her companions are capable of bestowing this will often be mortifying to herself and burthensome to others and should circumstances be untoward and her mind be not sufficiently furnished with ideas and knowledge this craving would be most pernicious to herself preying upon mind and body <\s>
<s> she will be too easily pleased apt to overrate the merits of new acquaintances subject to fits of over love and over joy in absence from those she loves full of fears and apprehensions c injurious to her health her passions for the most part will be happy and good but she will be too little mistress of them <\s>
<s> the distinctions which her intellect will make will be apt able and just but in conversation she will be prone to overshoot herself and commit eloquent blunders through eagerness <\s>
<s> in fine her manners will be frank and ardent but they will want dignity and a want of dignity will be the general defect of her character <\s>
<s> something of this sort of character which i have thus loosely sketched and something of the sort of selfishness to which i have adverted it seems to me that under the best management you have reason to apprehend for your daughter <\s>
<s> if she should happen to be an only child or the only sister of brothers who would probably idolize her one might prophesy almost with absolute confidence that most of these qualities would be found in her in a great degree <\s>
<s> how then is the evil to be softened down or prevented <\s>
<s> assuredly not by mortifying her which is the course commonly pursued with such tempers nor by preaching to her about her own defects nor by overrunning her infancy with books about good boys and girls and bad boys and girls and all that trumpery but and this is the only important thing i have to say upon the subject by putting her in the way of acquiring without measure or limit such knowledge as will lead her out of herself such knowledge as is interesting for its own sake things known because they are interesting not interesting because they are known in a word by leaving her at liberty to luxuriate in such feelings and images as will feed her mind in silent pleasure <\s>
<s> this nourishment is contained in fairy tales romances the best biographies and histories and such parts of natural history relating to the powers and appearances of the earth and elements and the habits and structure of animals as belong to it not as an art or science but as a magazine of form and feeling <\s>
<s> this kind of knowledge is purely good a direct antidote to every evil to be apprehended and food absolutely necessary to preserve the mind of a child like yours from morbid appetites <\s>
<s> next to these objects comes such knowledge as while it is chiefly interesting for its own sake admits the fellowship of another sort of pleasure that of complacence from the conscious exertion of the faculties and love of praise <\s>
<s> the accomplishments of dancing music and drawing rank under this head grammar learning of languages botany probably and out of the way knowledge of arts and manufactures c <\s>
<s> the second class of objects as far as they tend to feed vanity and self conceit are evil but let them have their just proportion in the plan of education and they will afterwards contribute to destroy these by furnishing the mind with power and independent gratification the vanity will disappear and the good will remain <\s>
<s> lastly comes that class of objects which are interesting almost solely because they are known and the knowledge may be displayed and this unfortunately comprehends three fourths of what according to the plan of modern education children's heads are stuffed with that is minute remote or trifling facts in geography topography natural history chronology c or acquisitions in art or accomplishments which the child makes by rote and which are quite beyond its age things of no value in themselves but as they show cleverness things hurtful to any temper but to a child like yours absolute poison <\s>
<s> having said thus much it seems almost impertinent to add that your child above all should i might say be chained down to the severest attention to truth i mean to the minutest accuracy in every thing which she relates this will strike at the root of evil by teaching her to form correct notions of present things and will steadily strengthen her mind <\s>
<s> much caution should be taken not to damp her natural vivacity for this may have a very bad effect and by the indirect influence of the example of manly and dignified manners any excessive wildnesses of her own will be best kept under <\s>
<s> most unrelaxing firmness should from the present hour be maintained in withstanding such of her desires as are grossly unreasonable <\s>
<s> in those words it was his purpose to censure that barren contemplation which rests satisfied with itself in cases where the thoughts are of such quality that they may and ought to be embodied in action <\s>
<s> but he speaks now of the general superiority of thought to action as proceeding and governing all action that moves to salutary purposes and secondly as leading to elevation the absolute possession of the individual mind and to a consistency or harmony of the being within itself which no outward agency can reach to disturb or to impair and lastly as producing works of pure science or of the combined faculties of imagination feeling and reason works which both from their independence in their origin upon accident their nature their duration and the wide spread of their influence are entitled rightly to take place of the noblest and most beneficent deeds of heroes statesmen legislators or warriors <\s>
<s> yet beginning from the perception of this established superiority we do not suppose that the youth whom we wish to guide and encourage is to be insensible to those influences of wealth or rank or station by which the bulk of mankind are swayed <\s>
<s> our eyes have not been fixed upon virtue which lies apart from human nature or transcends it <\s>
<s> in fact there is no such virtue <\s>
<s> we neither suppose nor wish him to undervalue or slight these distinctions as modes of power things that may enable him to be more useful to his contemporaries nor as gratifications that may confer dignity upon his living person and through him upon those who love him nor as they may connect his name through a family to be founded by his success in a closer chain of gratitude with some portion of posterity who shall speak of him as among their ancestry with a more tender interest than the mere general bond of patriotism or humanity would supply <\s>
<s> we suppose no indifference to much less a contempt of these rewards but let them have their due place let it be ascertained when the soul is searched into that they are only an auxiliary motive to exertion never the principal or originating force <\s>
<s> if this be too much to expect from a youth who i take for granted possesses no ordinary endowments and whom circumstances with respect to the more dangerous passions have favoured then indeed must the noble spirit of the country be wasted away then would our institutions be deplorable and the education prevalent among us utterly vile and debasing <\s>
<s> but my correspondent who drew forth these thoughts has said rightly that the character of the age may not without injustice be thus branded <\s>
<s> he will not deny that without speaking of other countries there is in these islands in the departments of natural philosophy of mechanic ingenuity in the general activities of the country and in the particular excellence of individual minds in high stations civil or military enough to excite admiration and love in the sober minded and more than enough to intoxicate the youthful and inexperienced <\s>
<s> i will compare then an aspiring youth leaving the schools in which he has been disciplined and preparing to bear a part in the concerns of the world i will compare him in this season of eager admiration to a newly invested knight appearing with his blank unsignalized shield upon some day of solemn tournament at the court of the faery queen as that sovereignty was conceived to exist by the moral and imaginative genius of our divine spenser <\s>

<s> i have in this declaration insensibly overstepped the limits which i had determined not to pass let me be forgiven for it is hope which hath carried me forward <\s>
<s> in such a mixed assemblage as our age presents with its genuine merit and its large overbalance of alloy i may boldly ask into what errors either with respect to person or thing could a young man fall who had sincerely entered upon the course of moral discipline which has been recommended and to which the condition of youth it has been proved is favourable <\s>

<s> nor can there be any need to be sedulous in calling out her affections her own lively enjoyments will do all this for her and also point out what is to be done to her <\s>
<s> but take all the pains you can she will be too much noticed <\s>
<s> other evils will also beset her arising more from herself and how are these to be obviated <\s>
<s> but first let us attempt to find what these evils will be <\s>
<s> observe i put all gross mismanagement out of the question and i believe they will then probably be as follows first as mentioned before a considerable portion of vanity <\s>
<s> but if the child be not constrained too much and be left sufficiently to her own pursuits and be not too anxiously tended and have not her mind planted over by art with likings that do not spring naturally up in it this will by the liveliness of her independent enjoyment almost entirely disappear and she will become modest and diffident and being not apt from the same ruling cause i mean the freshness of her own sensations to compare herself with others she will hold herself in too humble estimation <\s>
<s> but she will probably still be selfish and this brings me to the explanation of what i hinted at before viz in what manner she will be selfish <\s>
<s> it appears then to me that all the permanent evils which you have to apprehend for your daughter supposing you should live to educate her yourself may be referred to this principle an undue predominance of present objects over absent ones which as she will surely be distinguished by an extreme love of those about her will produce a certain restlessness of mind calling perpetually for proofs of ever living regard and affection she must be loved as much and in the same way as she loves or she will not be satisfied <\s>
<s> hence quickness in taking offence petty jealousies and apprehensions lest she is neglected or loses ground in people's love a want of a calm and steady sense of her own merits to secure her from these fits of imagined slights for in the first place she will as is hinted at before be in general deficient in this just estimation of her own worth and will further be apt to forget everything of that kind in the present sense of supposed injury <\s>
<s> she will all which is referable to the same cause in the company of others have too constant a craving for sympathy up to a height beyond what her companions are capable of bestowing this will often be mortifying to herself and burthensome to others and should circumstances be untoward and her mind be not sufficiently furnished with ideas and knowledge this craving would be most pernicious to herself preying upon mind and body <\s>
<s> she will be too easily pleased apt to overrate the merits of new acquaintances subject to fits of over love and over joy in absence from those she loves full of fears and apprehensions c injurious to her health her passions for the most part will be happy and good but she will be too little mistress of them <\s>
<s> the distinctions which her intellect will make will be apt able and just but in conversation she will be prone to overshoot herself and commit eloquent blunders through eagerness <\s>
<s> in fine her manners will be frank and ardent but they will want dignity and a want of dignity will be the general defect of her character <\s>
<s> something of this sort of character which i have thus loosely sketched and something of the sort of selfishness to which i have adverted it seems to me that under the best management you have reason to apprehend for your daughter <\s>
<s> if she should happen to be an only child or the only sister of brothers who would probably idolize her one might prophesy almost with absolute confidence that most of these qualities would be found in her in a great degree <\s>
<s> how then is the evil to be softened down or prevented <\s>
<s> assuredly not by mortifying her which is the course commonly pursued with such tempers nor by preaching to her about her own defects nor by overrunning her infancy with books about good boys and girls and bad boys and girls and all that trumpery but and this is the only important thing i have to say upon the subject by putting her in the way of acquiring without measure or limit such knowledge as will lead her out of herself such knowledge as is interesting for its own sake things known because they are interesting not interesting because they are known in a word by leaving her at liberty to luxuriate in such feelings and images as will feed her mind in silent pleasure <\s>
<s> this nourishment is contained in fairy tales romances the best biographies and histories and such parts of natural history relating to the powers and appearances of the earth and elements and the habits and structure of animals as belong to it not as an art or science but as a magazine of form and feeling <\s>
<s> this kind of knowledge is purely good a direct antidote to every evil to be apprehended and food absolutely necessary to preserve the mind of a child like yours from morbid appetites <\s>
<s> next to these objects comes such knowledge as while it is chiefly interesting for its own sake admits the fellowship of another sort of pleasure that of complacence from the conscious exertion of the faculties and love of praise <\s>
<s> the accomplishments of dancing music and drawing rank under this head grammar learning of languages botany probably and out of the way knowledge of arts and manufactures c <\s>
<s> the second class of objects as far as they tend to feed vanity and self conceit are evil but let them have their just proportion in the plan of education and they will afterwards contribute to destroy these by furnishing the mind with power and independent gratification the vanity will disappear and the good will remain <\s>
<s> lastly comes that class of objects which are interesting almost solely because they are known and the knowledge may be displayed and this unfortunately comprehends three fourths of what according to the plan of modern education children's heads are stuffed with that is minute remote or trifling facts in geography topography natural history chronology c or acquisitions in art or accomplishments which the child makes by rote and which are quite beyond its age things of no value in themselves but as they show cleverness things hurtful to any temper but to a child like yours absolute poison <\s>
<s> having said thus much it seems almost impertinent to add that your child above all should i might say be chained down to the severest attention to truth i mean to the minutest accuracy in every thing which she relates this will strike at the root of evil by teaching her to form correct notions of present things and will steadily strengthen her mind <\s>
<s> much caution should be taken not to damp her natural vivacity for this may have a very bad effect and by the indirect influence of the example of manly and dignified manners any excessive wildnesses of her own will be best kept under <\s>
<s> most unrelaxing firmness should from the present hour be maintained in withstanding such of her desires as are grossly unreasonable <\s>

<s> dear sir i have carefully perused the review of the life of your friend robert burns 2 which you kindly transmitted to me the author has rendered a substantial service to the poet's memory and the annexed letters are all important to the subject <\s>
<s> after having expressed this opinion i shall not trouble you by commenting upon the publication but will confine myself to the request of mr <\s>

<s> but really i feel it a thing of much delicacy to give advice upon this occasion as it appears to me mainly not a question of opinion or of taste but a matter of conscience <\s>
<s> gilbert burns must know if any man living does what his brother was and no one will deny that he who possesses this knowledge is a man of unimpeachable veracity <\s>

<s> i know no better model as to proportion and the degree of detail required nor indeed as to the general execution than the life of milton by fenton prefixed to many editions of the paradise lost <\s>
<s> but a more copious narrative would be expected from a brother and some allowance ought to be made in this and other respects for an expectation so natural <\s>
<s> in this prefatory memoir when the author has prepared himself by reflecting that fraternal partiality may have rendered him in some points not so trustworthy as others less favoured by opportunity it will be incumbent upon him to proceed candidly and openly as far as such a procedure will tend to restore to his brother that portion of public estimation of which he appears to have been unjustly deprived <\s>
<s> nay when we recall to mind the black things which have been written of this great man and the frightful ones that have been insinuated against him and as far as the public knew till lately without complaint remonstrance or disavowal from his nearest relatives i am not sure that it would not be best at this day explicitly to declare to what degree robert burns had given way to pernicious habits and as nearly as may be to fix the point to which his moral character had been degraded <\s>
<s> it is a disgraceful feature of the times that this measure should be necessary most painful to think that a brother should have such an office to perform <\s>
<s> but if gilbert burns be conscious that the subject will bear to be so treated he has no choice the duty has been imposed upon him by the errors into which the former biographer has fallen in respect to the very principles upon which his work ought to have been conducted <\s>
<s> i well remember the acute sorrow with which by my own fire side i first perused dr <\s>
<s> currie's narrative and some of the letters particularly of those composed in the latter part of the poet's life <\s>
<s> if my pity for burns was extreme this pity did not preclude a strong indignation of which he was not the object <\s>
<s> if said i it were in the power of a biographer to relate the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth the friends and surviving kindred of the deceased for the sake of general benefit to mankind might endure that such heart rending communication should be made to the world <\s>
<s> but in no case is this possible and in the present the opportunities of directly acquiring other than superficial knowledge have been most scanty for the writer has barely seen the person who is the subject of his tale nor did his avocations allow him to take the pains necessary for ascertaining what portion of the information conveyed to him was authentic <\s>
<s> so much for facts and actions and to what purpose relate them even were they true if the narrative cannot be heard without extreme pain unless they are placed in such a light and brought forward in such order that they shall explain their own laws and leave the reader in as little uncertainty as the mysteries of our nature will allow respecting the spirit from which they derived their existence and which governed the agent <\s>

<s> how happened it that the recollection of this affecting passage did not check so amiable a man as dr <\s>

<s> he must have known enough of human nature to be assured that men would be eager to sit in judgment and pronounce decidedly upon the guilt or innocence of burns by his testimony nay that there were multitudes whose main interest in the allegations would be derived from the incitements which they found therein to undertake this presumptuous office <\s>
<s> and where lies the collateral benefit or what ultimate advantage can be expected to counteract the injury that the many are thus tempted to do to their own minds and to compensate the sorrow which must be fixed in the hearts of the considerate few by language that proclaims so much and provokes conjectures as unfavourable as imagination can furnish <\s>
<s> here said i being moved beyond what it would become me to express here is a revolting account of a man of exquisite genius and confessedly of many high moral qualities sunk into the lowest depths of vice and misery <\s>
<s> but the painful story notwithstanding its minuteness is incomplete in essentials it is deficient so that the most attentive and sagacious reader cannot explain how a mind so well established by knowledge fell and continued to fall without power to prevent or retard its own ruin <\s>

<s> we have the author's letters discharged upon us in showers but how few readers will take the trouble of comparing those letters with each other and with the other documents of the publication in order to come at a genuine knowledge of the writer's character the life of johnson by boswell had broken through many pre existing delicacies and afforded the british public an opportunity of acquiring experience which before it had happily wanted nevertheless at the time when the ill selected medley of burns's correspondence first appeared little progress had been made nor is it likely that by the mass of mankind much ever will be made in determining what portion of these confidential communications escapes the pen in courteous yet often innocent compliance to gratify the several tastes of correspondents and as little towards distinguishing opinions and sentiments uttered for the momentary amusement merely of the writer's own fancy from those which his judgment deliberately approves and his heart faithfully cherishes <\s>

<s> dear sir i have carefully perused the review of the life of your friend robert burns 2 which you kindly transmitted to me the author has rendered a substantial service to the poet's memory and the annexed letters are all important to the subject <\s>
<s> after having expressed this opinion i shall not trouble you by commenting upon the publication but will confine myself to the request of mr <\s>

<s> but really i feel it a thing of much delicacy to give advice upon this occasion as it appears to me mainly not a question of opinion or of taste but a matter of conscience <\s>
<s> gilbert burns must know if any man living does what his brother was and no one will deny that he who possesses this knowledge is a man of unimpeachable veracity <\s>

<s> i know no better model as to proportion and the degree of detail required nor indeed as to the general execution than the life of milton by fenton prefixed to many editions of the paradise lost <\s>
<s> but a more copious narrative would be expected from a brother and some allowance ought to be made in this and other respects for an expectation so natural <\s>
<s> in this prefatory memoir when the author has prepared himself by reflecting that fraternal partiality may have rendered him in some points not so trustworthy as others less favoured by opportunity it will be incumbent upon him to proceed candidly and openly as far as such a procedure will tend to restore to his brother that portion of public estimation of which he appears to have been unjustly deprived <\s>
<s> nay when we recall to mind the black things which have been written of this great man and the frightful ones that have been insinuated against him and as far as the public knew till lately without complaint remonstrance or disavowal from his nearest relatives i am not sure that it would not be best at this day explicitly to declare to what degree robert burns had given way to pernicious habits and as nearly as may be to fix the point to which his moral character had been degraded <\s>
<s> it is a disgraceful feature of the times that this measure should be necessary most painful to think that a brother should have such an office to perform <\s>
<s> but if gilbert burns be conscious that the subject will bear to be so treated he has no choice the duty has been imposed upon him by the errors into which the former biographer has fallen in respect to the very principles upon which his work ought to have been conducted <\s>
<s> i well remember the acute sorrow with which by my own fire side i first perused dr <\s>
<s> currie's narrative and some of the letters particularly of those composed in the latter part of the poet's life <\s>
<s> if my pity for burns was extreme this pity did not preclude a strong indignation of which he was not the object <\s>
<s> if said i it were in the power of a biographer to relate the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth the friends and surviving kindred of the deceased for the sake of general benefit to mankind might endure that such heart rending communication should be made to the world <\s>

<s> so much for facts and actions and to what purpose relate them even were they true if the narrative cannot be heard without extreme pain unless they are placed in such a light and brought forward in such order that they shall explain their own laws and leave the reader in as little uncertainty as the mysteries of our nature will allow respecting the spirit from which they derived their existence and which governed the agent <\s>

<s> here said i being moved beyond what it would become me to express here is a revolting account of a man of exquisite genius and confessedly of many high moral qualities sunk into the lowest depths of vice and misery <\s>

<s> but really i feel it a thing of much delicacy to give advice upon this occasion as it appears to me mainly not a question of opinion or of taste but a matter of conscience <\s>

<s> but a more copious narrative would be expected from a brother and some allowance ought to be made in this and other respects for an expectation so natural <\s>
<s> in this prefatory memoir when the author has prepared himself by reflecting that fraternal partiality may have rendered him in some points not so trustworthy as others less favoured by opportunity it will be incumbent upon him to proceed candidly and openly as far as such a procedure will tend to restore to his brother that portion of public estimation of which he appears to have been unjustly deprived <\s>
<s> nay when we recall to mind the black things which have been written of this great man and the frightful ones that have been insinuated against him and as far as the public knew till lately without complaint remonstrance or disavowal from his nearest relatives i am not sure that it would not be best at this day explicitly to declare to what degree robert burns had given way to pernicious habits and as nearly as may be to fix the point to which his moral character had been degraded <\s>
<s> it is a disgraceful feature of the times that this measure should be necessary most painful to think that a brother should have such an office to perform <\s>
<s> but if gilbert burns be conscious that the subject will bear to be so treated he has no choice the duty has been imposed upon him by the errors into which the former biographer has fallen in respect to the very principles upon which his work ought to have been conducted <\s>

<s> so much for facts and actions and to what purpose relate them even were they true if the narrative cannot be heard without extreme pain unless they are placed in such a light and brought forward in such order that they shall explain their own laws and leave the reader in as little uncertainty as the mysteries of our nature will allow respecting the spirit from which they derived their existence and which governed the agent <\s>

<s> dear sir i have carefully perused the review of the life of your friend robert burns 2 which you kindly transmitted to me the author has rendered a substantial service to the poet's memory and the annexed letters are all important to the subject <\s>

<s> but really i feel it a thing of much delicacy to give advice upon this occasion as it appears to me mainly not a question of opinion or of taste but a matter of conscience <\s>
<s> gilbert burns must know if any man living does what his brother was and no one will deny that he who possesses this knowledge is a man of unimpeachable veracity <\s>

<s> i know no better model as to proportion and the degree of detail required nor indeed as to the general execution than the life of milton by fenton prefixed to many editions of the paradise lost <\s>
<s> but a more copious narrative would be expected from a brother and some allowance ought to be made in this and other respects for an expectation so natural <\s>
<s> in this prefatory memoir when the author has prepared himself by reflecting that fraternal partiality may have rendered him in some points not so trustworthy as others less favoured by opportunity it will be incumbent upon him to proceed candidly and openly as far as such a procedure will tend to restore to his brother that portion of public estimation of which he appears to have been unjustly deprived <\s>
<s> nay when we recall to mind the black things which have been written of this great man and the frightful ones that have been insinuated against him and as far as the public knew till lately without complaint remonstrance or disavowal from his nearest relatives i am not sure that it would not be best at this day explicitly to declare to what degree robert burns had given way to pernicious habits and as nearly as may be to fix the point to which his moral character had been degraded <\s>
<s> it is a disgraceful feature of the times that this measure should be necessary most painful to think that a brother should have such an office to perform <\s>
<s> but if gilbert burns be conscious that the subject will bear to be so treated he has no choice the duty has been imposed upon him by the errors into which the former biographer has fallen in respect to the very principles upon which his work ought to have been conducted <\s>
<s> i well remember the acute sorrow with which by my own fire side i first perused dr <\s>
<s> currie's narrative and some of the letters particularly of those composed in the latter part of the poet's life <\s>
<s> if my pity for burns was extreme this pity did not preclude a strong indignation of which he was not the object <\s>
<s> if said i it were in the power of a biographer to relate the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth the friends and surviving kindred of the deceased for the sake of general benefit to mankind might endure that such heart rending communication should be made to the world <\s>

<s> so much for facts and actions and to what purpose relate them even were they true if the narrative cannot be heard without extreme pain unless they are placed in such a light and brought forward in such order that they shall explain their own laws and leave the reader in as little uncertainty as the mysteries of our nature will allow respecting the spirit from which they derived their existence and which governed the agent <\s>

<s> how happened it that the recollection of this affecting passage did not check so amiable a man as dr <\s>

<s> here said i being moved beyond what it would become me to express here is a revolting account of a man of exquisite genius and confessedly of many high moral qualities sunk into the lowest depths of vice and misery <\s>
<s> but the painful story notwithstanding its minuteness is incomplete in essentials it is deficient so that the most attentive and sagacious reader cannot explain how a mind so well established by knowledge fell and continued to fall without power to prevent or retard its own ruin <\s>

<s> dear sir i have carefully perused the review of the life of your friend robert burns 2 which you kindly transmitted to me the author has rendered a substantial service to the poet's memory and the annexed letters are all important to the subject <\s>
<s> after having expressed this opinion i shall not trouble you by commenting upon the publication but will confine myself to the request of mr <\s>

<s> but really i feel it a thing of much delicacy to give advice upon this occasion as it appears to me mainly not a question of opinion or of taste but a matter of conscience <\s>
<s> gilbert burns must know if any man living does what his brother was and no one will deny that he who possesses this knowledge is a man of unimpeachable veracity <\s>

<s> i know no better model as to proportion and the degree of detail required nor indeed as to the general execution than the life of milton by fenton prefixed to many editions of the paradise lost <\s>
<s> but a more copious narrative would be expected from a brother and some allowance ought to be made in this and other respects for an expectation so natural <\s>
<s> in this prefatory memoir when the author has prepared himself by reflecting that fraternal partiality may have rendered him in some points not so trustworthy as others less favoured by opportunity it will be incumbent upon him to proceed candidly and openly as far as such a procedure will tend to restore to his brother that portion of public estimation of which he appears to have been unjustly deprived <\s>
<s> nay when we recall to mind the black things which have been written of this great man and the frightful ones that have been insinuated against him and as far as the public knew till lately without complaint remonstrance or disavowal from his nearest relatives i am not sure that it would not be best at this day explicitly to declare to what degree robert burns had given way to pernicious habits and as nearly as may be to fix the point to which his moral character had been degraded <\s>
<s> it is a disgraceful feature of the times that this measure should be necessary most painful to think that a brother should have such an office to perform <\s>
<s> but if gilbert burns be conscious that the subject will bear to be so treated he has no choice the duty has been imposed upon him by the errors into which the former biographer has fallen in respect to the very principles upon which his work ought to have been conducted <\s>

<s> so much for facts and actions and to what purpose relate them even were they true if the narrative cannot be heard without extreme pain unless they are placed in such a light and brought forward in such order that they shall explain their own laws and leave the reader in as little uncertainty as the mysteries of our nature will allow respecting the spirit from which they derived their existence and which governed the agent <\s>

<s> here said i being moved beyond what it would become me to express here is a revolting account of a man of exquisite genius and confessedly of many high moral qualities sunk into the lowest depths of vice and misery <\s>
<s> but the painful story notwithstanding its minuteness is incomplete in essentials it is deficient so that the most attentive and sagacious reader cannot explain how a mind so well established by knowledge fell and continued to fall without power to prevent or retard its own ruin <\s>

<s> dear sir i have carefully perused the review of the life of your friend robert burns 2 which you kindly transmitted to me the author has rendered a substantial service to the poet's memory and the annexed letters are all important to the subject <\s>
<s> after having expressed this opinion i shall not trouble you by commenting upon the publication but will confine myself to the request of mr <\s>

<s> but really i feel it a thing of much delicacy to give advice upon this occasion as it appears to me mainly not a question of opinion or of taste but a matter of conscience <\s>
<s> gilbert burns must know if any man living does what his brother was and no one will deny that he who possesses this knowledge is a man of unimpeachable veracity <\s>

<s> currie's life is to be republished as it now stands in connexion with the poems and letters and especially if prefixed to them but in my judgment it would be best to copy the example which mason has given in his second edition of gray's works <\s>
<s> there inverting the order which had been properly adopted when the life and letters were new matter the poems are placed first and the rest takes its place as subsidiary to them <\s>
<s> if this were done in the intended edition of burns's works i should strenuously recommend that a concise life of the poet be prefixed from the pen of gilbert burns who has already given public proof how well qualified he is for the undertaking <\s>
<s> i know no better model as to proportion and the degree of detail required nor indeed as to the general execution than the life of milton by fenton prefixed to many editions of the paradise lost <\s>
<s> but a more copious narrative would be expected from a brother and some allowance ought to be made in this and other respects for an expectation so natural <\s>
<s> in this prefatory memoir when the author has prepared himself by reflecting that fraternal partiality may have rendered him in some points not so trustworthy as others less favoured by opportunity it will be incumbent upon him to proceed candidly and openly as far as such a procedure will tend to restore to his brother that portion of public estimation of which he appears to have been unjustly deprived <\s>
<s> nay when we recall to mind the black things which have been written of this great man and the frightful ones that have been insinuated against him and as far as the public knew till lately without complaint remonstrance or disavowal from his nearest relatives i am not sure that it would not be best at this day explicitly to declare to what degree robert burns had given way to pernicious habits and as nearly as may be to fix the point to which his moral character had been degraded <\s>
<s> it is a disgraceful feature of the times that this measure should be necessary most painful to think that a brother should have such an office to perform <\s>
<s> but if gilbert burns be conscious that the subject will bear to be so treated he has no choice the duty has been imposed upon him by the errors into which the former biographer has fallen in respect to the very principles upon which his work ought to have been conducted <\s>
<s> i well remember the acute sorrow with which by my own fire side i first perused dr <\s>
<s> currie's narrative and some of the letters particularly of those composed in the latter part of the poet's life <\s>
<s> if my pity for burns was extreme this pity did not preclude a strong indignation of which he was not the object <\s>
<s> if said i it were in the power of a biographer to relate the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth the friends and surviving kindred of the deceased for the sake of general benefit to mankind might endure that such heart rending communication should be made to the world <\s>
<s> but in no case is this possible and in the present the opportunities of directly acquiring other than superficial knowledge have been most scanty for the writer has barely seen the person who is the subject of his tale nor did his avocations allow him to take the pains necessary for ascertaining what portion of the information conveyed to him was authentic <\s>
<s> so much for facts and actions and to what purpose relate them even were they true if the narrative cannot be heard without extreme pain unless they are placed in such a light and brought forward in such order that they shall explain their own laws and leave the reader in as little uncertainty as the mysteries of our nature will allow respecting the spirit from which they derived their existence and which governed the agent <\s>
<s> but hear on this pathetic and awful subject the poet himself pleading for those who have transgressed <\s>
<s> one point must still be greatly dark the moving why they do it and just as lamely can ye mark how far perhaps they rue it <\s>
<s> who made the heart tis he alone decidedly can try us he knows each chord its various tone each spring its various bias <\s>
<s> then at the balance let's be mute we never can adjust it what's done we partly may compute but know not what's resisted <\s>
<s> how happened it that the recollection of this affecting passage did not check so amiable a man as dr <\s>
<s> currie while he was revealing to the world the infirmities of its author <\s>
<s> he must have known enough of human nature to be assured that men would be eager to sit in judgment and pronounce decidedly upon the guilt or innocence of burns by his testimony nay that there were multitudes whose main interest in the allegations would be derived from the incitements which they found therein to undertake this presumptuous office <\s>
<s> and where lies the collateral benefit or what ultimate advantage can be expected to counteract the injury that the many are thus tempted to do to their own minds and to compensate the sorrow which must be fixed in the hearts of the considerate few by language that proclaims so much and provokes conjectures as unfavourable as imagination can furnish <\s>
<s> here said i being moved beyond what it would become me to express here is a revolting account of a man of exquisite genius and confessedly of many high moral qualities sunk into the lowest depths of vice and misery <\s>
<s> but the painful story notwithstanding its minuteness is incomplete in essentials it is deficient so that the most attentive and sagacious reader cannot explain how a mind so well established by knowledge fell and continued to fall without power to prevent or retard its own ruin <\s>
<s> would a bosom friend of the author his counsellor and confessor have told such things if true as this book contains <\s>
<s> and who but one possessed of the intimate knowledge which none but a bosom friend can acquire could have been justified in making these avowals <\s>
<s> such a one himself a pure spirit having accompanied as it were upon wings the pilgrim along the sorrowful road which he trod on foot such a one neither hurried down by its slippery descents nor entangled among its thorns nor perplexed by its windings nor discomfited by its founderous passages for the instruction of others might have delineated almost as in a map the way which the afflicted pilgrim had pursued till the sad close of his diversified journey <\s>
<s> in this manner the venerable spirit of isaac walton was qualified to have retraced the unsteady course of a highly gifted man who in this lamentable point and in versatility of genius bore no unobvious resemblance to the scottish bard i mean his friend cotton whom notwithstanding all that the sage must have disapproved in his life he honoured with the title of son <\s>
<s> nothing like this however has the biographer of burns accomplished and with his means of information copious as in some respects they were it would have been absurd to attempt it <\s>

<s> after having expressed this opinion i shall not trouble you by commenting upon the publication but will confine myself to the request of mr <\s>

<s> but really i feel it a thing of much delicacy to give advice upon this occasion as it appears to me mainly not a question of opinion or of taste but a matter of conscience <\s>

<s> i know no better model as to proportion and the degree of detail required nor indeed as to the general execution than the life of milton by fenton prefixed to many editions of the paradise lost <\s>
<s> but a more copious narrative would be expected from a brother and some allowance ought to be made in this and other respects for an expectation so natural <\s>
<s> in this prefatory memoir when the author has prepared himself by reflecting that fraternal partiality may have rendered him in some points not so trustworthy as others less favoured by opportunity it will be incumbent upon him to proceed candidly and openly as far as such a procedure will tend to restore to his brother that portion of public estimation of which he appears to have been unjustly deprived <\s>
<s> nay when we recall to mind the black things which have been written of this great man and the frightful ones that have been insinuated against him and as far as the public knew till lately without complaint remonstrance or disavowal from his nearest relatives i am not sure that it would not be best at this day explicitly to declare to what degree robert burns had given way to pernicious habits and as nearly as may be to fix the point to which his moral character had been degraded <\s>
<s> it is a disgraceful feature of the times that this measure should be necessary most painful to think that a brother should have such an office to perform <\s>
<s> but if gilbert burns be conscious that the subject will bear to be so treated he has no choice the duty has been imposed upon him by the errors into which the former biographer has fallen in respect to the very principles upon which his work ought to have been conducted <\s>

<s> if said i it were in the power of a biographer to relate the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth the friends and surviving kindred of the deceased for the sake of general benefit to mankind might endure that such heart rending communication should be made to the world <\s>

<s> so much for facts and actions and to what purpose relate them even were they true if the narrative cannot be heard without extreme pain unless they are placed in such a light and brought forward in such order that they shall explain their own laws and leave the reader in as little uncertainty as the mysteries of our nature will allow respecting the spirit from which they derived their existence and which governed the agent <\s>

<s> how happened it that the recollection of this affecting passage did not check so amiable a man as dr <\s>

<s> he must have known enough of human nature to be assured that men would be eager to sit in judgment and pronounce decidedly upon the guilt or innocence of burns by his testimony nay that there were multitudes whose main interest in the allegations would be derived from the incitements which they found therein to undertake this presumptuous office <\s>

<s> here said i being moved beyond what it would become me to express here is a revolting account of a man of exquisite genius and confessedly of many high moral qualities sunk into the lowest depths of vice and misery <\s>

<s> in this prefatory memoir when the author has prepared himself by reflecting that fraternal partiality may have rendered him in some points not so trustworthy as others less favoured by opportunity it will be incumbent upon him to proceed candidly and openly as far as such a procedure will tend to restore to his brother that portion of public estimation of which he appears to have been unjustly deprived <\s>
<s> nay when we recall to mind the black things which have been written of this great man and the frightful ones that have been insinuated against him and as far as the public knew till lately without complaint remonstrance or disavowal from his nearest relatives i am not sure that it would not be best at this day explicitly to declare to what degree robert burns had given way to pernicious habits and as nearly as may be to fix the point to which his moral character had been degraded <\s>
<s> it is a disgraceful feature of the times that this measure should be necessary most painful to think that a brother should have such an office to perform <\s>

<s> but really i feel it a thing of much delicacy to give advice upon this occasion as it appears to me mainly not a question of opinion or of taste but a matter of conscience <\s>

<s> but a more copious narrative would be expected from a brother and some allowance ought to be made in this and other respects for an expectation so natural <\s>
<s> in this prefatory memoir when the author has prepared himself by reflecting that fraternal partiality may have rendered him in some points not so trustworthy as others less favoured by opportunity it will be incumbent upon him to proceed candidly and openly as far as such a procedure will tend to restore to his brother that portion of public estimation of which he appears to have been unjustly deprived <\s>
<s> nay when we recall to mind the black things which have been written of this great man and the frightful ones that have been insinuated against him and as far as the public knew till lately without complaint remonstrance or disavowal from his nearest relatives i am not sure that it would not be best at this day explicitly to declare to what degree robert burns had given way to pernicious habits and as nearly as may be to fix the point to which his moral character had been degraded <\s>
<s> it is a disgraceful feature of the times that this measure should be necessary most painful to think that a brother should have such an office to perform <\s>
<s> but if gilbert burns be conscious that the subject will bear to be so treated he has no choice the duty has been imposed upon him by the errors into which the former biographer has fallen in respect to the very principles upon which his work ought to have been conducted <\s>

<s> but in no case is this possible and in the present the opportunities of directly acquiring other than superficial knowledge have been most scanty for the writer has barely seen the person who is the subject of his tale nor did his avocations allow him to take the pains necessary for ascertaining what portion of the information conveyed to him was authentic <\s>
<s> so much for facts and actions and to what purpose relate them even were they true if the narrative cannot be heard without extreme pain unless they are placed in such a light and brought forward in such order that they shall explain their own laws and leave the reader in as little uncertainty as the mysteries of our nature will allow respecting the spirit from which they derived their existence and which governed the agent <\s>

<s> but really i feel it a thing of much delicacy to give advice upon this occasion as it appears to me mainly not a question of opinion or of taste but a matter of conscience <\s>

<s> after having expressed this opinion i shall not trouble you by commenting upon the publication but will confine myself to the request of mr <\s>
<s> gilbert burns that i would furnish him with my notions upon the best mode of conducting the defence of his brother's injured reputation a favourable opportunity being now afforded him to convey his sentiments to the world along with a republication of dr <\s>
<s> currie's book which he is about to superintend <\s>
<s> from the respect which i have long felt for the character of the person who has thus honoured me and from the gratitude which as a lover of poetry i owe to the genius of his departed relative i should most gladly comply with this wish if i could hope that any suggestions of mine would be of service to the cause <\s>
<s> but really i feel it a thing of much delicacy to give advice upon this occasion as it appears to me mainly not a question of opinion or of taste but a matter of conscience <\s>
<s> gilbert burns must know if any man living does what his brother was and no one will deny that he who possesses this knowledge is a man of unimpeachable veracity <\s>
<s> he has already spoken to the world in contradiction of the injurious assertions that have been made and has told why he forbore to do this on their first appearance <\s>
<s> 2 a review of the life of robert burns and of various criticisms on his character and writings by alexander peterkin 1814 <\s>
<s> if it be deemed adviseable to reprint dr <\s>
<s> currie's narrative without striking out such passages as the author if he were now alive would probably be happy to efface let there be notes attached to the most obnoxious of them in which the misrepresentations may be corrected and the exaggerations exposed <\s>
<s> i recommend this course if dr <\s>
<s> currie's life is to be republished as it now stands in connexion with the poems and letters and especially if prefixed to them but in my judgment it would be best to copy the example which mason has given in his second edition of gray's works <\s>
<s> there inverting the order which had been properly adopted when the life and letters were new matter the poems are placed first and the rest takes its place as subsidiary to them <\s>
<s> if this were done in the intended edition of burns's works i should strenuously recommend that a concise life of the poet be prefixed from the pen of gilbert burns who has already given public proof how well qualified he is for the undertaking <\s>
<s> i know no better model as to proportion and the degree of detail required nor indeed as to the general execution than the life of milton by fenton prefixed to many editions of the paradise lost <\s>
<s> but a more copious narrative would be expected from a brother and some allowance ought to be made in this and other respects for an expectation so natural <\s>
<s> in this prefatory memoir when the author has prepared himself by reflecting that fraternal partiality may have rendered him in some points not so trustworthy as others less favoured by opportunity it will be incumbent upon him to proceed candidly and openly as far as such a procedure will tend to restore to his brother that portion of public estimation of which he appears to have been unjustly deprived <\s>
<s> nay when we recall to mind the black things which have been written of this great man and the frightful ones that have been insinuated against him and as far as the public knew till lately without complaint remonstrance or disavowal from his nearest relatives i am not sure that it would not be best at this day explicitly to declare to what degree robert burns had given way to pernicious habits and as nearly as may be to fix the point to which his moral character had been degraded <\s>
<s> it is a disgraceful feature of the times that this measure should be necessary most painful to think that a brother should have such an office to perform <\s>
<s> but if gilbert burns be conscious that the subject will bear to be so treated he has no choice the duty has been imposed upon him by the errors into which the former biographer has fallen in respect to the very principles upon which his work ought to have been conducted <\s>
<s> i well remember the acute sorrow with which by my own fire side i first perused dr <\s>
<s> currie's narrative and some of the letters particularly of those composed in the latter part of the poet's life <\s>
<s> if my pity for burns was extreme this pity did not preclude a strong indignation of which he was not the object <\s>
<s> if said i it were in the power of a biographer to relate the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth the friends and surviving kindred of the deceased for the sake of general benefit to mankind might endure that such heart rending communication should be made to the world <\s>
<s> but in no case is this possible and in the present the opportunities of directly acquiring other than superficial knowledge have been most scanty for the writer has barely seen the person who is the subject of his tale nor did his avocations allow him to take the pains necessary for ascertaining what portion of the information conveyed to him was authentic <\s>
<s> so much for facts and actions and to what purpose relate them even were they true if the narrative cannot be heard without extreme pain unless they are placed in such a light and brought forward in such order that they shall explain their own laws and leave the reader in as little uncertainty as the mysteries of our nature will allow respecting the spirit from which they derived their existence and which governed the agent <\s>
<s> but hear on this pathetic and awful subject the poet himself pleading for those who have transgressed <\s>
<s> one point must still be greatly dark the moving why they do it and just as lamely can ye mark how far perhaps they rue it <\s>
<s> who made the heart tis he alone decidedly can try us he knows each chord its various tone each spring its various bias <\s>
<s> then at the balance let's be mute we never can adjust it what's done we partly may compute but know not what's resisted <\s>
<s> how happened it that the recollection of this affecting passage did not check so amiable a man as dr <\s>
<s> currie while he was revealing to the world the infirmities of its author <\s>
<s> he must have known enough of human nature to be assured that men would be eager to sit in judgment and pronounce decidedly upon the guilt or innocence of burns by his testimony nay that there were multitudes whose main interest in the allegations would be derived from the incitements which they found therein to undertake this presumptuous office <\s>
<s> and where lies the collateral benefit or what ultimate advantage can be expected to counteract the injury that the many are thus tempted to do to their own minds and to compensate the sorrow which must be fixed in the hearts of the considerate few by language that proclaims so much and provokes conjectures as unfavourable as imagination can furnish <\s>
<s> here said i being moved beyond what it would become me to express here is a revolting account of a man of exquisite genius and confessedly of many high moral qualities sunk into the lowest depths of vice and misery <\s>
<s> but the painful story notwithstanding its minuteness is incomplete in essentials it is deficient so that the most attentive and sagacious reader cannot explain how a mind so well established by knowledge fell and continued to fall without power to prevent or retard its own ruin <\s>
<s> would a bosom friend of the author his counsellor and confessor have told such things if true as this book contains <\s>
<s> and who but one possessed of the intimate knowledge which none but a bosom friend can acquire could have been justified in making these avowals <\s>
<s> such a one himself a pure spirit having accompanied as it were upon wings the pilgrim along the sorrowful road which he trod on foot such a one neither hurried down by its slippery descents nor entangled among its thorns nor perplexed by its windings nor discomfited by its founderous passages for the instruction of others might have delineated almost as in a map the way which the afflicted pilgrim had pursued till the sad close of his diversified journey <\s>
<s> in this manner the venerable spirit of isaac walton was qualified to have retraced the unsteady course of a highly gifted man who in this lamentable point and in versatility of genius bore no unobvious resemblance to the scottish bard i mean his friend cotton whom notwithstanding all that the sage must have disapproved in his life he honoured with the title of son <\s>
<s> nothing like this however has the biographer of burns accomplished and with his means of information copious as in some respects they were it would have been absurd to attempt it <\s>
<s> the only motive therefore which could authorize the writing and publishing matter so distressing to read is wanting <\s>
<s> currie's performance censurable from these considerations alone for information which would have been of absolute worth if in his capacity of biographer and editor he had known when to stop short is rendered unsatisfactory and inefficacious through the absence of this reserve and from being coupled with statements of improbable and irreconcileable facts <\s>
<s> we have the author's letters discharged upon us in showers but how few readers will take the trouble of comparing those letters with each other and with the other documents of the publication in order to come at a genuine knowledge of the writer's character the life of johnson by boswell had broken through many pre existing delicacies and afforded the british public an opportunity of acquiring experience which before it had happily wanted nevertheless at the time when the ill selected medley of burns's correspondence first appeared little progress had been made nor is it likely that by the mass of mankind much ever will be made in determining what portion of these confidential communications escapes the pen in courteous yet often innocent compliance to gratify the several tastes of correspondents and as little towards distinguishing opinions and sentiments uttered for the momentary amusement merely of the writer's own fancy from those which his judgment deliberately approves and his heart faithfully cherishes <\s>
<s> but the subject of this book was a man of extraordinary genius whose birth education and employments had placed and kept him in a situation far below that in which the writers and readers of expensive volumes are usually found <\s>
<s> critics upon works of fiction have laid it down as a rule that remoteness of place in fixing the choice of a subject and in prescribing the mode of treating it is equal in effect to distance of time restraints may be thrown off accordingly <\s>
<s> judge then of the delusions which artificial distinctions impose when to a man like doctor currie writing with views so honourable the social condition of the individual of whom he was treating could seem to place him at such a distance from the exalted reader that ceremony might he discarded with him and his memory sacrificed as it were almost without compunction <\s>
<s> the poet was laid where these injuries could not reach him but he had a parent i understand an admirable woman still surviving a brother like gilbert burns a widow estimable for her virtues and children at that time infants with the world before them which they must face to obtain a maintenance who remembered their father probably with the tenderest affection and whose opening minds as their years advanced would become conscious of so many reasons for admiring him ill fated child of nature too frequently thine own enemy unhappy favourite of genius too often misguided this is indeed to be crushed beneath the furrow's weight <\s>
<s> why sir do i write to you at this length when all that i had to express in direct answer to the request which occasioned this letter lay in such narrow compass because having entered upon the subject i am unable to quit it your feelings i trust go along with mine and rising from this individual case to a general view of the subject you will probably agree with me in opinion that biography though differing in some essentials from works of fiction is nevertheless like them an art an art the laws of which are determined by the imperfections of our nature and the constitution of society <\s>
<s> truth is not here as in the sciences and in natural philosophy to be sought without scruple and promulgated for its own sake upon the mere chance of its being serviceable but only for obviously justifying purposes moral or intellectual <\s>
<s> silence is a privilege of the grave a right of the departed let him therefore who infringes that right by speaking publicly of for or against those who cannot speak for themselves take heed that he opens not his mouth without a sufficient sanction <\s>
<s> de mortuis nil nisi bonum is a rule in which these sentiments have been pushed to an extreme that proves how deeply humanity is interested in maintaining them <\s>
<s> and it was wise to announce the precept thus absolutely both because there exist in that same nature by which it has been dictated so many temptations to disregard it and because there are powers and influences within and without us that will prevent its being literally fulfilled to the suppression of profitable truth <\s>
<s> penalties of law conventions of manners and personal fear protect the reputation of the living and something of this protection is extended to the recently dead who survive to a certain degree in their kindred and friends <\s>
<s> few are so insensible as not to feel this and not to be actuated by the feeling <\s>
<s> but only to philosophy enlightened by the affections does it belong justly to estimate the claims of the deceased on the one hand and of the present age and future generations on the other and to strike a balance between them such philosophy runs a risk of becoming extinct among us if the coarse intrusions into the recesses the gross breaches upon the sanctities of domestic life to which we have lately been more and more accustomed are to be regarded as indications of a vigorous state of public feeling favourable to the maintenance of the liberties of our country intelligent lovers of freedom are from necessity bold and hardy lovers of truth but according to the measure in which their love is intelligent is it attended with a finer discrimination and a more sensitive delicacy <\s>
<s> the wise and good and all others being lovers of licence rather than of liberty are in fact slaves respect as one of the noblest characteristics of englishmen that jealousy of familiar approach which while it contributes to the maintenance of private dignity is one of the most efficacious guardians of rational public freedom <\s>
<s> the general obligation upon which i have insisted is especially binding upon those who undertake the biography of authors <\s>
<s> assuredly there is no cause why the lives of that class of men should be pried into with the same diligent curiosity and laid open with the same disregard of reserve which may sometimes be expedient in composing the history of men who have borne an active part in the world <\s>
<s> such thorough knowledge of the good and bad qualities of these latter as can only be obtained by a scrutiny of their private lives conduces to explain not only their own public conduct but that of those with whom they have acted <\s>

<s> dear sir i have carefully perused the review of the life of your friend robert burns 2 which you kindly transmitted to me the author has rendered a substantial service to the poet's memory and the annexed letters are all important to the subject <\s>
<s> after having expressed this opinion i shall not trouble you by commenting upon the publication but will confine myself to the request of mr <\s>
<s> gilbert burns that i would furnish him with my notions upon the best mode of conducting the defence of his brother's injured reputation a favourable opportunity being now afforded him to convey his sentiments to the world along with a republication of dr <\s>
<s> currie's book which he is about to superintend <\s>
<s> from the respect which i have long felt for the character of the person who has thus honoured me and from the gratitude which as a lover of poetry i owe to the genius of his departed relative i should most gladly comply with this wish if i could hope that any suggestions of mine would be of service to the cause <\s>
<s> but really i feel it a thing of much delicacy to give advice upon this occasion as it appears to me mainly not a question of opinion or of taste but a matter of conscience <\s>
<s> gilbert burns must know if any man living does what his brother was and no one will deny that he who possesses this knowledge is a man of unimpeachable veracity <\s>
<s> he has already spoken to the world in contradiction of the injurious assertions that have been made and has told why he forbore to do this on their first appearance <\s>
<s> 2 a review of the life of robert burns and of various criticisms on his character and writings by alexander peterkin 1814 <\s>
<s> if it be deemed adviseable to reprint dr <\s>
<s> currie's narrative without striking out such passages as the author if he were now alive would probably be happy to efface let there be notes attached to the most obnoxious of them in which the misrepresentations may be corrected and the exaggerations exposed <\s>
<s> i recommend this course if dr <\s>
<s> currie's life is to be republished as it now stands in connexion with the poems and letters and especially if prefixed to them but in my judgment it would be best to copy the example which mason has given in his second edition of gray's works <\s>
<s> there inverting the order which had been properly adopted when the life and letters were new matter the poems are placed first and the rest takes its place as subsidiary to them <\s>
<s> if this were done in the intended edition of burns's works i should strenuously recommend that a concise life of the poet be prefixed from the pen of gilbert burns who has already given public proof how well qualified he is for the undertaking <\s>
<s> i know no better model as to proportion and the degree of detail required nor indeed as to the general execution than the life of milton by fenton prefixed to many editions of the paradise lost <\s>
<s> but a more copious narrative would be expected from a brother and some allowance ought to be made in this and other respects for an expectation so natural <\s>
<s> in this prefatory memoir when the author has prepared himself by reflecting that fraternal partiality may have rendered him in some points not so trustworthy as others less favoured by opportunity it will be incumbent upon him to proceed candidly and openly as far as such a procedure will tend to restore to his brother that portion of public estimation of which he appears to have been unjustly deprived <\s>
<s> nay when we recall to mind the black things which have been written of this great man and the frightful ones that have been insinuated against him and as far as the public knew till lately without complaint remonstrance or disavowal from his nearest relatives i am not sure that it would not be best at this day explicitly to declare to what degree robert burns had given way to pernicious habits and as nearly as may be to fix the point to which his moral character had been degraded <\s>
<s> it is a disgraceful feature of the times that this measure should be necessary most painful to think that a brother should have such an office to perform <\s>
<s> but if gilbert burns be conscious that the subject will bear to be so treated he has no choice the duty has been imposed upon him by the errors into which the former biographer has fallen in respect to the very principles upon which his work ought to have been conducted <\s>
<s> i well remember the acute sorrow with which by my own fire side i first perused dr <\s>
<s> currie's narrative and some of the letters particularly of those composed in the latter part of the poet's life <\s>
<s> if my pity for burns was extreme this pity did not preclude a strong indignation of which he was not the object <\s>
<s> if said i it were in the power of a biographer to relate the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth the friends and surviving kindred of the deceased for the sake of general benefit to mankind might endure that such heart rending communication should be made to the world <\s>
<s> but in no case is this possible and in the present the opportunities of directly acquiring other than superficial knowledge have been most scanty for the writer has barely seen the person who is the subject of his tale nor did his avocations allow him to take the pains necessary for ascertaining what portion of the information conveyed to him was authentic <\s>
<s> so much for facts and actions and to what purpose relate them even were they true if the narrative cannot be heard without extreme pain unless they are placed in such a light and brought forward in such order that they shall explain their own laws and leave the reader in as little uncertainty as the mysteries of our nature will allow respecting the spirit from which they derived their existence and which governed the agent <\s>
<s> but hear on this pathetic and awful subject the poet himself pleading for those who have transgressed <\s>
<s> one point must still be greatly dark the moving why they do it and just as lamely can ye mark how far perhaps they rue it <\s>
<s> who made the heart tis he alone decidedly can try us he knows each chord its various tone each spring its various bias <\s>
<s> then at the balance let's be mute we never can adjust it what's done we partly may compute but know not what's resisted <\s>
<s> how happened it that the recollection of this affecting passage did not check so amiable a man as dr <\s>
<s> currie while he was revealing to the world the infirmities of its author <\s>
<s> he must have known enough of human nature to be assured that men would be eager to sit in judgment and pronounce decidedly upon the guilt or innocence of burns by his testimony nay that there were multitudes whose main interest in the allegations would be derived from the incitements which they found therein to undertake this presumptuous office <\s>
<s> and where lies the collateral benefit or what ultimate advantage can be expected to counteract the injury that the many are thus tempted to do to their own minds and to compensate the sorrow which must be fixed in the hearts of the considerate few by language that proclaims so much and provokes conjectures as unfavourable as imagination can furnish <\s>
<s> here said i being moved beyond what it would become me to express here is a revolting account of a man of exquisite genius and confessedly of many high moral qualities sunk into the lowest depths of vice and misery <\s>
<s> but the painful story notwithstanding its minuteness is incomplete in essentials it is deficient so that the most attentive and sagacious reader cannot explain how a mind so well established by knowledge fell and continued to fall without power to prevent or retard its own ruin <\s>
<s> would a bosom friend of the author his counsellor and confessor have told such things if true as this book contains <\s>
<s> and who but one possessed of the intimate knowledge which none but a bosom friend can acquire could have been justified in making these avowals <\s>
<s> such a one himself a pure spirit having accompanied as it were upon wings the pilgrim along the sorrowful road which he trod on foot such a one neither hurried down by its slippery descents nor entangled among its thorns nor perplexed by its windings nor discomfited by its founderous passages for the instruction of others might have delineated almost as in a map the way which the afflicted pilgrim had pursued till the sad close of his diversified journey <\s>
<s> in this manner the venerable spirit of isaac walton was qualified to have retraced the unsteady course of a highly gifted man who in this lamentable point and in versatility of genius bore no unobvious resemblance to the scottish bard i mean his friend cotton whom notwithstanding all that the sage must have disapproved in his life he honoured with the title of son <\s>
<s> nothing like this however has the biographer of burns accomplished and with his means of information copious as in some respects they were it would have been absurd to attempt it <\s>
<s> the only motive therefore which could authorize the writing and publishing matter so distressing to read is wanting <\s>
<s> currie's performance censurable from these considerations alone for information which would have been of absolute worth if in his capacity of biographer and editor he had known when to stop short is rendered unsatisfactory and inefficacious through the absence of this reserve and from being coupled with statements of improbable and irreconcileable facts <\s>
<s> we have the author's letters discharged upon us in showers but how few readers will take the trouble of comparing those letters with each other and with the other documents of the publication in order to come at a genuine knowledge of the writer's character the life of johnson by boswell had broken through many pre existing delicacies and afforded the british public an opportunity of acquiring experience which before it had happily wanted nevertheless at the time when the ill selected medley of burns's correspondence first appeared little progress had been made nor is it likely that by the mass of mankind much ever will be made in determining what portion of these confidential communications escapes the pen in courteous yet often innocent compliance to gratify the several tastes of correspondents and as little towards distinguishing opinions and sentiments uttered for the momentary amusement merely of the writer's own fancy from those which his judgment deliberately approves and his heart faithfully cherishes <\s>
<s> but the subject of this book was a man of extraordinary genius whose birth education and employments had placed and kept him in a situation far below that in which the writers and readers of expensive volumes are usually found <\s>
<s> critics upon works of fiction have laid it down as a rule that remoteness of place in fixing the choice of a subject and in prescribing the mode of treating it is equal in effect to distance of time restraints may be thrown off accordingly <\s>
<s> judge then of the delusions which artificial distinctions impose when to a man like doctor currie writing with views so honourable the social condition of the individual of whom he was treating could seem to place him at such a distance from the exalted reader that ceremony might he discarded with him and his memory sacrificed as it were almost without compunction <\s>
<s> the poet was laid where these injuries could not reach him but he had a parent i understand an admirable woman still surviving a brother like gilbert burns a widow estimable for her virtues and children at that time infants with the world before them which they must face to obtain a maintenance who remembered their father probably with the tenderest affection and whose opening minds as their years advanced would become conscious of so many reasons for admiring him ill fated child of nature too frequently thine own enemy unhappy favourite of genius too often misguided this is indeed to be crushed beneath the furrow's weight <\s>
<s> why sir do i write to you at this length when all that i had to express in direct answer to the request which occasioned this letter lay in such narrow compass because having entered upon the subject i am unable to quit it your feelings i trust go along with mine and rising from this individual case to a general view of the subject you will probably agree with me in opinion that biography though differing in some essentials from works of fiction is nevertheless like them an art an art the laws of which are determined by the imperfections of our nature and the constitution of society <\s>
<s> truth is not here as in the sciences and in natural philosophy to be sought without scruple and promulgated for its own sake upon the mere chance of its being serviceable but only for obviously justifying purposes moral or intellectual <\s>
<s> silence is a privilege of the grave a right of the departed let him therefore who infringes that right by speaking publicly of for or against those who cannot speak for themselves take heed that he opens not his mouth without a sufficient sanction <\s>
<s> de mortuis nil nisi bonum is a rule in which these sentiments have been pushed to an extreme that proves how deeply humanity is interested in maintaining them <\s>
<s> and it was wise to announce the precept thus absolutely both because there exist in that same nature by which it has been dictated so many temptations to disregard it and because there are powers and influences within and without us that will prevent its being literally fulfilled to the suppression of profitable truth <\s>
<s> penalties of law conventions of manners and personal fear protect the reputation of the living and something of this protection is extended to the recently dead who survive to a certain degree in their kindred and friends <\s>
<s> few are so insensible as not to feel this and not to be actuated by the feeling <\s>
<s> but only to philosophy enlightened by the affections does it belong justly to estimate the claims of the deceased on the one hand and of the present age and future generations on the other and to strike a balance between them such philosophy runs a risk of becoming extinct among us if the coarse intrusions into the recesses the gross breaches upon the sanctities of domestic life to which we have lately been more and more accustomed are to be regarded as indications of a vigorous state of public feeling favourable to the maintenance of the liberties of our country intelligent lovers of freedom are from necessity bold and hardy lovers of truth but according to the measure in which their love is intelligent is it attended with a finer discrimination and a more sensitive delicacy <\s>

<s> dear sir i have carefully perused the review of the life of your friend robert burns 2 which you kindly transmitted to me the author has rendered a substantial service to the poet's memory and the annexed letters are all important to the subject <\s>
<s> after having expressed this opinion i shall not trouble you by commenting upon the publication but will confine myself to the request of mr <\s>
<s> gilbert burns that i would furnish him with my notions upon the best mode of conducting the defence of his brother's injured reputation a favourable opportunity being now afforded him to convey his sentiments to the world along with a republication of dr <\s>

<s> from the respect which i have long felt for the character of the person who has thus honoured me and from the gratitude which as a lover of poetry i owe to the genius of his departed relative i should most gladly comply with this wish if i could hope that any suggestions of mine would be of service to the cause <\s>
<s> but really i feel it a thing of much delicacy to give advice upon this occasion as it appears to me mainly not a question of opinion or of taste but a matter of conscience <\s>
<s> gilbert burns must know if any man living does what his brother was and no one will deny that he who possesses this knowledge is a man of unimpeachable veracity <\s>

<s> i recommend this course if dr <\s>
<s> currie's life is to be republished as it now stands in connexion with the poems and letters and especially if prefixed to them but in my judgment it would be best to copy the example which mason has given in his second edition of gray's works <\s>
<s> there inverting the order which had been properly adopted when the life and letters were new matter the poems are placed first and the rest takes its place as subsidiary to them <\s>
<s> if this were done in the intended edition of burns's works i should strenuously recommend that a concise life of the poet be prefixed from the pen of gilbert burns who has already given public proof how well qualified he is for the undertaking <\s>
<s> i know no better model as to proportion and the degree of detail required nor indeed as to the general execution than the life of milton by fenton prefixed to many editions of the paradise lost <\s>
<s> but a more copious narrative would be expected from a brother and some allowance ought to be made in this and other respects for an expectation so natural <\s>
<s> in this prefatory memoir when the author has prepared himself by reflecting that fraternal partiality may have rendered him in some points not so trustworthy as others less favoured by opportunity it will be incumbent upon him to proceed candidly and openly as far as such a procedure will tend to restore to his brother that portion of public estimation of which he appears to have been unjustly deprived <\s>
<s> nay when we recall to mind the black things which have been written of this great man and the frightful ones that have been insinuated against him and as far as the public knew till lately without complaint remonstrance or disavowal from his nearest relatives i am not sure that it would not be best at this day explicitly to declare to what degree robert burns had given way to pernicious habits and as nearly as may be to fix the point to which his moral character had been degraded <\s>
<s> it is a disgraceful feature of the times that this measure should be necessary most painful to think that a brother should have such an office to perform <\s>
<s> but if gilbert burns be conscious that the subject will bear to be so treated he has no choice the duty has been imposed upon him by the errors into which the former biographer has fallen in respect to the very principles upon which his work ought to have been conducted <\s>
<s> i well remember the acute sorrow with which by my own fire side i first perused dr <\s>
<s> currie's narrative and some of the letters particularly of those composed in the latter part of the poet's life <\s>
<s> if my pity for burns was extreme this pity did not preclude a strong indignation of which he was not the object <\s>
<s> if said i it were in the power of a biographer to relate the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth the friends and surviving kindred of the deceased for the sake of general benefit to mankind might endure that such heart rending communication should be made to the world <\s>
<s> but in no case is this possible and in the present the opportunities of directly acquiring other than superficial knowledge have been most scanty for the writer has barely seen the person who is the subject of his tale nor did his avocations allow him to take the pains necessary for ascertaining what portion of the information conveyed to him was authentic <\s>
<s> so much for facts and actions and to what purpose relate them even were they true if the narrative cannot be heard without extreme pain unless they are placed in such a light and brought forward in such order that they shall explain their own laws and leave the reader in as little uncertainty as the mysteries of our nature will allow respecting the spirit from which they derived their existence and which governed the agent <\s>
<s> but hear on this pathetic and awful subject the poet himself pleading for those who have transgressed <\s>
<s> one point must still be greatly dark the moving why they do it and just as lamely can ye mark how far perhaps they rue it <\s>
<s> who made the heart tis he alone decidedly can try us he knows each chord its various tone each spring its various bias <\s>
<s> then at the balance let's be mute we never can adjust it what's done we partly may compute but know not what's resisted <\s>
<s> how happened it that the recollection of this affecting passage did not check so amiable a man as dr <\s>
<s> currie while he was revealing to the world the infirmities of its author <\s>
<s> he must have known enough of human nature to be assured that men would be eager to sit in judgment and pronounce decidedly upon the guilt or innocence of burns by his testimony nay that there were multitudes whose main interest in the allegations would be derived from the incitements which they found therein to undertake this presumptuous office <\s>
<s> and where lies the collateral benefit or what ultimate advantage can be expected to counteract the injury that the many are thus tempted to do to their own minds and to compensate the sorrow which must be fixed in the hearts of the considerate few by language that proclaims so much and provokes conjectures as unfavourable as imagination can furnish <\s>
<s> here said i being moved beyond what it would become me to express here is a revolting account of a man of exquisite genius and confessedly of many high moral qualities sunk into the lowest depths of vice and misery <\s>
<s> but the painful story notwithstanding its minuteness is incomplete in essentials it is deficient so that the most attentive and sagacious reader cannot explain how a mind so well established by knowledge fell and continued to fall without power to prevent or retard its own ruin <\s>
<s> would a bosom friend of the author his counsellor and confessor have told such things if true as this book contains <\s>
<s> and who but one possessed of the intimate knowledge which none but a bosom friend can acquire could have been justified in making these avowals <\s>
<s> such a one himself a pure spirit having accompanied as it were upon wings the pilgrim along the sorrowful road which he trod on foot such a one neither hurried down by its slippery descents nor entangled among its thorns nor perplexed by its windings nor discomfited by its founderous passages for the instruction of others might have delineated almost as in a map the way which the afflicted pilgrim had pursued till the sad close of his diversified journey <\s>
<s> in this manner the venerable spirit of isaac walton was qualified to have retraced the unsteady course of a highly gifted man who in this lamentable point and in versatility of genius bore no unobvious resemblance to the scottish bard i mean his friend cotton whom notwithstanding all that the sage must have disapproved in his life he honoured with the title of son <\s>
<s> nothing like this however has the biographer of burns accomplished and with his means of information copious as in some respects they were it would have been absurd to attempt it <\s>
<s> the only motive therefore which could authorize the writing and publishing matter so distressing to read is wanting <\s>
<s> currie's performance censurable from these considerations alone for information which would have been of absolute worth if in his capacity of biographer and editor he had known when to stop short is rendered unsatisfactory and inefficacious through the absence of this reserve and from being coupled with statements of improbable and irreconcileable facts <\s>
<s> we have the author's letters discharged upon us in showers but how few readers will take the trouble of comparing those letters with each other and with the other documents of the publication in order to come at a genuine knowledge of the writer's character the life of johnson by boswell had broken through many pre existing delicacies and afforded the british public an opportunity of acquiring experience which before it had happily wanted nevertheless at the time when the ill selected medley of burns's correspondence first appeared little progress had been made nor is it likely that by the mass of mankind much ever will be made in determining what portion of these confidential communications escapes the pen in courteous yet often innocent compliance to gratify the several tastes of correspondents and as little towards distinguishing opinions and sentiments uttered for the momentary amusement merely of the writer's own fancy from those which his judgment deliberately approves and his heart faithfully cherishes <\s>

<s> a a letter to a friend of robert burns <\s>
<s> to james gray esq edinburgh <\s>
<s> dear sir i have carefully perused the review of the life of your friend robert burns 2 which you kindly transmitted to me the author has rendered a substantial service to the poet's memory and the annexed letters are all important to the subject <\s>
<s> after having expressed this opinion i shall not trouble you by commenting upon the publication but will confine myself to the request of mr <\s>
<s> gilbert burns that i would furnish him with my notions upon the best mode of conducting the defence of his brother's injured reputation a favourable opportunity being now afforded him to convey his sentiments to the world along with a republication of dr <\s>
<s> currie's book which he is about to superintend <\s>
<s> from the respect which i have long felt for the character of the person who has thus honoured me and from the gratitude which as a lover of poetry i owe to the genius of his departed relative i should most gladly comply with this wish if i could hope that any suggestions of mine would be of service to the cause <\s>
<s> but really i feel it a thing of much delicacy to give advice upon this occasion as it appears to me mainly not a question of opinion or of taste but a matter of conscience <\s>
<s> gilbert burns must know if any man living does what his brother was and no one will deny that he who possesses this knowledge is a man of unimpeachable veracity <\s>
<s> he has already spoken to the world in contradiction of the injurious assertions that have been made and has told why he forbore to do this on their first appearance <\s>
<s> 2 a review of the life of robert burns and of various criticisms on his character and writings by alexander peterkin 1814 <\s>
<s> if it be deemed adviseable to reprint dr <\s>
<s> currie's narrative without striking out such passages as the author if he were now alive would probably be happy to efface let there be notes attached to the most obnoxious of them in which the misrepresentations may be corrected and the exaggerations exposed <\s>
<s> i recommend this course if dr <\s>
<s> currie's life is to be republished as it now stands in connexion with the poems and letters and especially if prefixed to them but in my judgment it would be best to copy the example which mason has given in his second edition of gray's works <\s>
<s> there inverting the order which had been properly adopted when the life and letters were new matter the poems are placed first and the rest takes its place as subsidiary to them <\s>
<s> if this were done in the intended edition of burns's works i should strenuously recommend that a concise life of the poet be prefixed from the pen of gilbert burns who has already given public proof how well qualified he is for the undertaking <\s>
<s> i know no better model as to proportion and the degree of detail required nor indeed as to the general execution than the life of milton by fenton prefixed to many editions of the paradise lost <\s>
<s> but a more copious narrative would be expected from a brother and some allowance ought to be made in this and other respects for an expectation so natural <\s>
<s> in this prefatory memoir when the author has prepared himself by reflecting that fraternal partiality may have rendered him in some points not so trustworthy as others less favoured by opportunity it will be incumbent upon him to proceed candidly and openly as far as such a procedure will tend to restore to his brother that portion of public estimation of which he appears to have been unjustly deprived <\s>
<s> nay when we recall to mind the black things which have been written of this great man and the frightful ones that have been insinuated against him and as far as the public knew till lately without complaint remonstrance or disavowal from his nearest relatives i am not sure that it would not be best at this day explicitly to declare to what degree robert burns had given way to pernicious habits and as nearly as may be to fix the point to which his moral character had been degraded <\s>
<s> it is a disgraceful feature of the times that this measure should be necessary most painful to think that a brother should have such an office to perform <\s>
<s> but if gilbert burns be conscious that the subject will bear to be so treated he has no choice the duty has been imposed upon him by the errors into which the former biographer has fallen in respect to the very principles upon which his work ought to have been conducted <\s>
<s> i well remember the acute sorrow with which by my own fire side i first perused dr <\s>
<s> currie's narrative and some of the letters particularly of those composed in the latter part of the poet's life <\s>
<s> if my pity for burns was extreme this pity did not preclude a strong indignation of which he was not the object <\s>
<s> if said i it were in the power of a biographer to relate the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth the friends and surviving kindred of the deceased for the sake of general benefit to mankind might endure that such heart rending communication should be made to the world <\s>
<s> but in no case is this possible and in the present the opportunities of directly acquiring other than superficial knowledge have been most scanty for the writer has barely seen the person who is the subject of his tale nor did his avocations allow him to take the pains necessary for ascertaining what portion of the information conveyed to him was authentic <\s>
<s> so much for facts and actions and to what purpose relate them even were they true if the narrative cannot be heard without extreme pain unless they are placed in such a light and brought forward in such order that they shall explain their own laws and leave the reader in as little uncertainty as the mysteries of our nature will allow respecting the spirit from which they derived their existence and which governed the agent <\s>
<s> but hear on this pathetic and awful subject the poet himself pleading for those who have transgressed <\s>
<s> one point must still be greatly dark the moving why they do it and just as lamely can ye mark how far perhaps they rue it <\s>
<s> who made the heart tis he alone decidedly can try us he knows each chord its various tone each spring its various bias <\s>
<s> then at the balance let's be mute we never can adjust it what's done we partly may compute but know not what's resisted <\s>
<s> how happened it that the recollection of this affecting passage did not check so amiable a man as dr <\s>
<s> currie while he was revealing to the world the infirmities of its author <\s>
<s> he must have known enough of human nature to be assured that men would be eager to sit in judgment and pronounce decidedly upon the guilt or innocence of burns by his testimony nay that there were multitudes whose main interest in the allegations would be derived from the incitements which they found therein to undertake this presumptuous office <\s>
<s> and where lies the collateral benefit or what ultimate advantage can be expected to counteract the injury that the many are thus tempted to do to their own minds and to compensate the sorrow which must be fixed in the hearts of the considerate few by language that proclaims so much and provokes conjectures as unfavourable as imagination can furnish <\s>
<s> here said i being moved beyond what it would become me to express here is a revolting account of a man of exquisite genius and confessedly of many high moral qualities sunk into the lowest depths of vice and misery <\s>
<s> but the painful story notwithstanding its minuteness is incomplete in essentials it is deficient so that the most attentive and sagacious reader cannot explain how a mind so well established by knowledge fell and continued to fall without power to prevent or retard its own ruin <\s>
<s> would a bosom friend of the author his counsellor and confessor have told such things if true as this book contains <\s>
<s> and who but one possessed of the intimate knowledge which none but a bosom friend can acquire could have been justified in making these avowals <\s>
<s> such a one himself a pure spirit having accompanied as it were upon wings the pilgrim along the sorrowful road which he trod on foot such a one neither hurried down by its slippery descents nor entangled among its thorns nor perplexed by its windings nor discomfited by its founderous passages for the instruction of others might have delineated almost as in a map the way which the afflicted pilgrim had pursued till the sad close of his diversified journey <\s>
<s> in this manner the venerable spirit of isaac walton was qualified to have retraced the unsteady course of a highly gifted man who in this lamentable point and in versatility of genius bore no unobvious resemblance to the scottish bard i mean his friend cotton whom notwithstanding all that the sage must have disapproved in his life he honoured with the title of son <\s>
<s> nothing like this however has the biographer of burns accomplished and with his means of information copious as in some respects they were it would have been absurd to attempt it <\s>
<s> the only motive therefore which could authorize the writing and publishing matter so distressing to read is wanting <\s>
<s> currie's performance censurable from these considerations alone for information which would have been of absolute worth if in his capacity of biographer and editor he had known when to stop short is rendered unsatisfactory and inefficacious through the absence of this reserve and from being coupled with statements of improbable and irreconcileable facts <\s>
<s> we have the author's letters discharged upon us in showers but how few readers will take the trouble of comparing those letters with each other and with the other documents of the publication in order to come at a genuine knowledge of the writer's character the life of johnson by boswell had broken through many pre existing delicacies and afforded the british public an opportunity of acquiring experience which before it had happily wanted nevertheless at the time when the ill selected medley of burns's correspondence first appeared little progress had been made nor is it likely that by the mass of mankind much ever will be made in determining what portion of these confidential communications escapes the pen in courteous yet often innocent compliance to gratify the several tastes of correspondents and as little towards distinguishing opinions and sentiments uttered for the momentary amusement merely of the writer's own fancy from those which his judgment deliberately approves and his heart faithfully cherishes <\s>
<s> but the subject of this book was a man of extraordinary genius whose birth education and employments had placed and kept him in a situation far below that in which the writers and readers of expensive volumes are usually found <\s>
<s> critics upon works of fiction have laid it down as a rule that remoteness of place in fixing the choice of a subject and in prescribing the mode of treating it is equal in effect to distance of time restraints may be thrown off accordingly <\s>
<s> judge then of the delusions which artificial distinctions impose when to a man like doctor currie writing with views so honourable the social condition of the individual of whom he was treating could seem to place him at such a distance from the exalted reader that ceremony might he discarded with him and his memory sacrificed as it were almost without compunction <\s>

<s> why sir do i write to you at this length when all that i had to express in direct answer to the request which occasioned this letter lay in such narrow compass because having entered upon the subject i am unable to quit it your feelings i trust go along with mine and rising from this individual case to a general view of the subject you will probably agree with me in opinion that biography though differing in some essentials from works of fiction is nevertheless like them an art an art the laws of which are determined by the imperfections of our nature and the constitution of society <\s>

<s> de mortuis nil nisi bonum is a rule in which these sentiments have been pushed to an extreme that proves how deeply humanity is interested in maintaining them <\s>

<s> few are so insensible as not to feel this and not to be actuated by the feeling <\s>
<s> but only to philosophy enlightened by the affections does it belong justly to estimate the claims of the deceased on the one hand and of the present age and future generations on the other and to strike a balance between them such philosophy runs a risk of becoming extinct among us if the coarse intrusions into the recesses the gross breaches upon the sanctities of domestic life to which we have lately been more and more accustomed are to be regarded as indications of a vigorous state of public feeling favourable to the maintenance of the liberties of our country intelligent lovers of freedom are from necessity bold and hardy lovers of truth but according to the measure in which their love is intelligent is it attended with a finer discrimination and a more sensitive delicacy <\s>

<s> dear sir i have carefully perused the review of the life of your friend robert burns 2 which you kindly transmitted to me the author has rendered a substantial service to the poet's memory and the annexed letters are all important to the subject <\s>
<s> after having expressed this opinion i shall not trouble you by commenting upon the publication but will confine myself to the request of mr <\s>
<s> gilbert burns that i would furnish him with my notions upon the best mode of conducting the defence of his brother's injured reputation a favourable opportunity being now afforded him to convey his sentiments to the world along with a republication of dr <\s>

<s> from the respect which i have long felt for the character of the person who has thus honoured me and from the gratitude which as a lover of poetry i owe to the genius of his departed relative i should most gladly comply with this wish if i could hope that any suggestions of mine would be of service to the cause <\s>
<s> but really i feel it a thing of much delicacy to give advice upon this occasion as it appears to me mainly not a question of opinion or of taste but a matter of conscience <\s>
<s> gilbert burns must know if any man living does what his brother was and no one will deny that he who possesses this knowledge is a man of unimpeachable veracity <\s>
<s> he has already spoken to the world in contradiction of the injurious assertions that have been made and has told why he forbore to do this on their first appearance <\s>

<s> currie's narrative without striking out such passages as the author if he were now alive would probably be happy to efface let there be notes attached to the most obnoxious of them in which the misrepresentations may be corrected and the exaggerations exposed <\s>
<s> i recommend this course if dr <\s>
<s> currie's life is to be republished as it now stands in connexion with the poems and letters and especially if prefixed to them but in my judgment it would be best to copy the example which mason has given in his second edition of gray's works <\s>
<s> there inverting the order which had been properly adopted when the life and letters were new matter the poems are placed first and the rest takes its place as subsidiary to them <\s>
<s> if this were done in the intended edition of burns's works i should strenuously recommend that a concise life of the poet be prefixed from the pen of gilbert burns who has already given public proof how well qualified he is for the undertaking <\s>
<s> i know no better model as to proportion and the degree of detail required nor indeed as to the general execution than the life of milton by fenton prefixed to many editions of the paradise lost <\s>
<s> but a more copious narrative would be expected from a brother and some allowance ought to be made in this and other respects for an expectation so natural <\s>
<s> in this prefatory memoir when the author has prepared himself by reflecting that fraternal partiality may have rendered him in some points not so trustworthy as others less favoured by opportunity it will be incumbent upon him to proceed candidly and openly as far as such a procedure will tend to restore to his brother that portion of public estimation of which he appears to have been unjustly deprived <\s>
<s> nay when we recall to mind the black things which have been written of this great man and the frightful ones that have been insinuated against him and as far as the public knew till lately without complaint remonstrance or disavowal from his nearest relatives i am not sure that it would not be best at this day explicitly to declare to what degree robert burns had given way to pernicious habits and as nearly as may be to fix the point to which his moral character had been degraded <\s>
<s> it is a disgraceful feature of the times that this measure should be necessary most painful to think that a brother should have such an office to perform <\s>
<s> but if gilbert burns be conscious that the subject will bear to be so treated he has no choice the duty has been imposed upon him by the errors into which the former biographer has fallen in respect to the very principles upon which his work ought to have been conducted <\s>
<s> i well remember the acute sorrow with which by my own fire side i first perused dr <\s>
<s> currie's narrative and some of the letters particularly of those composed in the latter part of the poet's life <\s>
<s> if my pity for burns was extreme this pity did not preclude a strong indignation of which he was not the object <\s>
<s> if said i it were in the power of a biographer to relate the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth the friends and surviving kindred of the deceased for the sake of general benefit to mankind might endure that such heart rending communication should be made to the world <\s>
<s> but in no case is this possible and in the present the opportunities of directly acquiring other than superficial knowledge have been most scanty for the writer has barely seen the person who is the subject of his tale nor did his avocations allow him to take the pains necessary for ascertaining what portion of the information conveyed to him was authentic <\s>
<s> so much for facts and actions and to what purpose relate them even were they true if the narrative cannot be heard without extreme pain unless they are placed in such a light and brought forward in such order that they shall explain their own laws and leave the reader in as little uncertainty as the mysteries of our nature will allow respecting the spirit from which they derived their existence and which governed the agent <\s>
<s> but hear on this pathetic and awful subject the poet himself pleading for those who have transgressed <\s>
<s> one point must still be greatly dark the moving why they do it and just as lamely can ye mark how far perhaps they rue it <\s>
<s> who made the heart tis he alone decidedly can try us he knows each chord its various tone each spring its various bias <\s>
<s> then at the balance let's be mute we never can adjust it what's done we partly may compute but know not what's resisted <\s>
<s> how happened it that the recollection of this affecting passage did not check so amiable a man as dr <\s>
<s> currie while he was revealing to the world the infirmities of its author <\s>
<s> he must have known enough of human nature to be assured that men would be eager to sit in judgment and pronounce decidedly upon the guilt or innocence of burns by his testimony nay that there were multitudes whose main interest in the allegations would be derived from the incitements which they found therein to undertake this presumptuous office <\s>
<s> and where lies the collateral benefit or what ultimate advantage can be expected to counteract the injury that the many are thus tempted to do to their own minds and to compensate the sorrow which must be fixed in the hearts of the considerate few by language that proclaims so much and provokes conjectures as unfavourable as imagination can furnish <\s>
<s> here said i being moved beyond what it would become me to express here is a revolting account of a man of exquisite genius and confessedly of many high moral qualities sunk into the lowest depths of vice and misery <\s>
<s> but the painful story notwithstanding its minuteness is incomplete in essentials it is deficient so that the most attentive and sagacious reader cannot explain how a mind so well established by knowledge fell and continued to fall without power to prevent or retard its own ruin <\s>
<s> would a bosom friend of the author his counsellor and confessor have told such things if true as this book contains <\s>
<s> and who but one possessed of the intimate knowledge which none but a bosom friend can acquire could have been justified in making these avowals <\s>
<s> such a one himself a pure spirit having accompanied as it were upon wings the pilgrim along the sorrowful road which he trod on foot such a one neither hurried down by its slippery descents nor entangled among its thorns nor perplexed by its windings nor discomfited by its founderous passages for the instruction of others might have delineated almost as in a map the way which the afflicted pilgrim had pursued till the sad close of his diversified journey <\s>

<s> dear sir i have carefully perused the review of the life of your friend robert burns 2 which you kindly transmitted to me the author has rendered a substantial service to the poet's memory and the annexed letters are all important to the subject <\s>
<s> after having expressed this opinion i shall not trouble you by commenting upon the publication but will confine myself to the request of mr <\s>

<s> but really i feel it a thing of much delicacy to give advice upon this occasion as it appears to me mainly not a question of opinion or of taste but a matter of conscience <\s>
<s> gilbert burns must know if any man living does what his brother was and no one will deny that he who possesses this knowledge is a man of unimpeachable veracity <\s>

<s> there inverting the order which had been properly adopted when the life and letters were new matter the poems are placed first and the rest takes its place as subsidiary to them <\s>
<s> if this were done in the intended edition of burns's works i should strenuously recommend that a concise life of the poet be prefixed from the pen of gilbert burns who has already given public proof how well qualified he is for the undertaking <\s>
<s> i know no better model as to proportion and the degree of detail required nor indeed as to the general execution than the life of milton by fenton prefixed to many editions of the paradise lost <\s>
<s> but a more copious narrative would be expected from a brother and some allowance ought to be made in this and other respects for an expectation so natural <\s>
<s> in this prefatory memoir when the author has prepared himself by reflecting that fraternal partiality may have rendered him in some points not so trustworthy as others less favoured by opportunity it will be incumbent upon him to proceed candidly and openly as far as such a procedure will tend to restore to his brother that portion of public estimation of which he appears to have been unjustly deprived <\s>
<s> nay when we recall to mind the black things which have been written of this great man and the frightful ones that have been insinuated against him and as far as the public knew till lately without complaint remonstrance or disavowal from his nearest relatives i am not sure that it would not be best at this day explicitly to declare to what degree robert burns had given way to pernicious habits and as nearly as may be to fix the point to which his moral character had been degraded <\s>
<s> it is a disgraceful feature of the times that this measure should be necessary most painful to think that a brother should have such an office to perform <\s>
<s> but if gilbert burns be conscious that the subject will bear to be so treated he has no choice the duty has been imposed upon him by the errors into which the former biographer has fallen in respect to the very principles upon which his work ought to have been conducted <\s>
<s> i well remember the acute sorrow with which by my own fire side i first perused dr <\s>
<s> currie's narrative and some of the letters particularly of those composed in the latter part of the poet's life <\s>
<s> if my pity for burns was extreme this pity did not preclude a strong indignation of which he was not the object <\s>
<s> if said i it were in the power of a biographer to relate the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth the friends and surviving kindred of the deceased for the sake of general benefit to mankind might endure that such heart rending communication should be made to the world <\s>
<s> but in no case is this possible and in the present the opportunities of directly acquiring other than superficial knowledge have been most scanty for the writer has barely seen the person who is the subject of his tale nor did his avocations allow him to take the pains necessary for ascertaining what portion of the information conveyed to him was authentic <\s>
<s> so much for facts and actions and to what purpose relate them even were they true if the narrative cannot be heard without extreme pain unless they are placed in such a light and brought forward in such order that they shall explain their own laws and leave the reader in as little uncertainty as the mysteries of our nature will allow respecting the spirit from which they derived their existence and which governed the agent <\s>
<s> but hear on this pathetic and awful subject the poet himself pleading for those who have transgressed <\s>
<s> one point must still be greatly dark the moving why they do it and just as lamely can ye mark how far perhaps they rue it <\s>
<s> who made the heart tis he alone decidedly can try us he knows each chord its various tone each spring its various bias <\s>
<s> then at the balance let's be mute we never can adjust it what's done we partly may compute but know not what's resisted <\s>
<s> how happened it that the recollection of this affecting passage did not check so amiable a man as dr <\s>
<s> currie while he was revealing to the world the infirmities of its author <\s>
<s> he must have known enough of human nature to be assured that men would be eager to sit in judgment and pronounce decidedly upon the guilt or innocence of burns by his testimony nay that there were multitudes whose main interest in the allegations would be derived from the incitements which they found therein to undertake this presumptuous office <\s>
<s> and where lies the collateral benefit or what ultimate advantage can be expected to counteract the injury that the many are thus tempted to do to their own minds and to compensate the sorrow which must be fixed in the hearts of the considerate few by language that proclaims so much and provokes conjectures as unfavourable as imagination can furnish <\s>
<s> here said i being moved beyond what it would become me to express here is a revolting account of a man of exquisite genius and confessedly of many high moral qualities sunk into the lowest depths of vice and misery <\s>
<s> but the painful story notwithstanding its minuteness is incomplete in essentials it is deficient so that the most attentive and sagacious reader cannot explain how a mind so well established by knowledge fell and continued to fall without power to prevent or retard its own ruin <\s>
<s> would a bosom friend of the author his counsellor and confessor have told such things if true as this book contains <\s>
<s> and who but one possessed of the intimate knowledge which none but a bosom friend can acquire could have been justified in making these avowals <\s>
<s> such a one himself a pure spirit having accompanied as it were upon wings the pilgrim along the sorrowful road which he trod on foot such a one neither hurried down by its slippery descents nor entangled among its thorns nor perplexed by its windings nor discomfited by its founderous passages for the instruction of others might have delineated almost as in a map the way which the afflicted pilgrim had pursued till the sad close of his diversified journey <\s>
<s> in this manner the venerable spirit of isaac walton was qualified to have retraced the unsteady course of a highly gifted man who in this lamentable point and in versatility of genius bore no unobvious resemblance to the scottish bard i mean his friend cotton whom notwithstanding all that the sage must have disapproved in his life he honoured with the title of son <\s>

<s> we have the author's letters discharged upon us in showers but how few readers will take the trouble of comparing those letters with each other and with the other documents of the publication in order to come at a genuine knowledge of the writer's character the life of johnson by boswell had broken through many pre existing delicacies and afforded the british public an opportunity of acquiring experience which before it had happily wanted nevertheless at the time when the ill selected medley of burns's correspondence first appeared little progress had been made nor is it likely that by the mass of mankind much ever will be made in determining what portion of these confidential communications escapes the pen in courteous yet often innocent compliance to gratify the several tastes of correspondents and as little towards distinguishing opinions and sentiments uttered for the momentary amusement merely of the writer's own fancy from those which his judgment deliberately approves and his heart faithfully cherishes <\s>

<s> dear sir i have carefully perused the review of the life of your friend robert burns 2 which you kindly transmitted to me the author has rendered a substantial service to the poet's memory and the annexed letters are all important to the subject <\s>
<s> after having expressed this opinion i shall not trouble you by commenting upon the publication but will confine myself to the request of mr <\s>

<s> but really i feel it a thing of much delicacy to give advice upon this occasion as it appears to me mainly not a question of opinion or of taste but a matter of conscience <\s>
<s> gilbert burns must know if any man living does what his brother was and no one will deny that he who possesses this knowledge is a man of unimpeachable veracity <\s>

<s> i know no better model as to proportion and the degree of detail required nor indeed as to the general execution than the life of milton by fenton prefixed to many editions of the paradise lost <\s>
<s> but a more copious narrative would be expected from a brother and some allowance ought to be made in this and other respects for an expectation so natural <\s>
<s> in this prefatory memoir when the author has prepared himself by reflecting that fraternal partiality may have rendered him in some points not so trustworthy as others less favoured by opportunity it will be incumbent upon him to proceed candidly and openly as far as such a procedure will tend to restore to his brother that portion of public estimation of which he appears to have been unjustly deprived <\s>
<s> nay when we recall to mind the black things which have been written of this great man and the frightful ones that have been insinuated against him and as far as the public knew till lately without complaint remonstrance or disavowal from his nearest relatives i am not sure that it would not be best at this day explicitly to declare to what degree robert burns had given way to pernicious habits and as nearly as may be to fix the point to which his moral character had been degraded <\s>
<s> it is a disgraceful feature of the times that this measure should be necessary most painful to think that a brother should have such an office to perform <\s>
<s> but if gilbert burns be conscious that the subject will bear to be so treated he has no choice the duty has been imposed upon him by the errors into which the former biographer has fallen in respect to the very principles upon which his work ought to have been conducted <\s>
<s> i well remember the acute sorrow with which by my own fire side i first perused dr <\s>
<s> currie's narrative and some of the letters particularly of those composed in the latter part of the poet's life <\s>
<s> if my pity for burns was extreme this pity did not preclude a strong indignation of which he was not the object <\s>
<s> if said i it were in the power of a biographer to relate the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth the friends and surviving kindred of the deceased for the sake of general benefit to mankind might endure that such heart rending communication should be made to the world <\s>
<s> but in no case is this possible and in the present the opportunities of directly acquiring other than superficial knowledge have been most scanty for the writer has barely seen the person who is the subject of his tale nor did his avocations allow him to take the pains necessary for ascertaining what portion of the information conveyed to him was authentic <\s>
<s> so much for facts and actions and to what purpose relate them even were they true if the narrative cannot be heard without extreme pain unless they are placed in such a light and brought forward in such order that they shall explain their own laws and leave the reader in as little uncertainty as the mysteries of our nature will allow respecting the spirit from which they derived their existence and which governed the agent <\s>

<s> here said i being moved beyond what it would become me to express here is a revolting account of a man of exquisite genius and confessedly of many high moral qualities sunk into the lowest depths of vice and misery <\s>
<s> but the painful story notwithstanding its minuteness is incomplete in essentials it is deficient so that the most attentive and sagacious reader cannot explain how a mind so well established by knowledge fell and continued to fall without power to prevent or retard its own ruin <\s>

<s> a a letter to a friend of robert burns <\s>
<s> to james gray esq edinburgh <\s>
<s> dear sir i have carefully perused the review of the life of your friend robert burns 2 which you kindly transmitted to me the author has rendered a substantial service to the poet's memory and the annexed letters are all important to the subject <\s>
<s> after having expressed this opinion i shall not trouble you by commenting upon the publication but will confine myself to the request of mr <\s>
<s> gilbert burns that i would furnish him with my notions upon the best mode of conducting the defence of his brother's injured reputation a favourable opportunity being now afforded him to convey his sentiments to the world along with a republication of dr <\s>
<s> currie's book which he is about to superintend <\s>
<s> from the respect which i have long felt for the character of the person who has thus honoured me and from the gratitude which as a lover of poetry i owe to the genius of his departed relative i should most gladly comply with this wish if i could hope that any suggestions of mine would be of service to the cause <\s>
<s> but really i feel it a thing of much delicacy to give advice upon this occasion as it appears to me mainly not a question of opinion or of taste but a matter of conscience <\s>
<s> gilbert burns must know if any man living does what his brother was and no one will deny that he who possesses this knowledge is a man of unimpeachable veracity <\s>
<s> he has already spoken to the world in contradiction of the injurious assertions that have been made and has told why he forbore to do this on their first appearance <\s>
<s> 2 a review of the life of robert burns and of various criticisms on his character and writings by alexander peterkin 1814 <\s>
<s> if it be deemed adviseable to reprint dr <\s>
<s> currie's narrative without striking out such passages as the author if he were now alive would probably be happy to efface let there be notes attached to the most obnoxious of them in which the misrepresentations may be corrected and the exaggerations exposed <\s>
<s> i recommend this course if dr <\s>
<s> currie's life is to be republished as it now stands in connexion with the poems and letters and especially if prefixed to them but in my judgment it would be best to copy the example which mason has given in his second edition of gray's works <\s>
<s> there inverting the order which had been properly adopted when the life and letters were new matter the poems are placed first and the rest takes its place as subsidiary to them <\s>
<s> if this were done in the intended edition of burns's works i should strenuously recommend that a concise life of the poet be prefixed from the pen of gilbert burns who has already given public proof how well qualified he is for the undertaking <\s>
<s> i know no better model as to proportion and the degree of detail required nor indeed as to the general execution than the life of milton by fenton prefixed to many editions of the paradise lost <\s>
<s> but a more copious narrative would be expected from a brother and some allowance ought to be made in this and other respects for an expectation so natural <\s>
<s> in this prefatory memoir when the author has prepared himself by reflecting that fraternal partiality may have rendered him in some points not so trustworthy as others less favoured by opportunity it will be incumbent upon him to proceed candidly and openly as far as such a procedure will tend to restore to his brother that portion of public estimation of which he appears to have been unjustly deprived <\s>
<s> nay when we recall to mind the black things which have been written of this great man and the frightful ones that have been insinuated against him and as far as the public knew till lately without complaint remonstrance or disavowal from his nearest relatives i am not sure that it would not be best at this day explicitly to declare to what degree robert burns had given way to pernicious habits and as nearly as may be to fix the point to which his moral character had been degraded <\s>
<s> it is a disgraceful feature of the times that this measure should be necessary most painful to think that a brother should have such an office to perform <\s>
<s> but if gilbert burns be conscious that the subject will bear to be so treated he has no choice the duty has been imposed upon him by the errors into which the former biographer has fallen in respect to the very principles upon which his work ought to have been conducted <\s>
<s> i well remember the acute sorrow with which by my own fire side i first perused dr <\s>
<s> currie's narrative and some of the letters particularly of those composed in the latter part of the poet's life <\s>
<s> if my pity for burns was extreme this pity did not preclude a strong indignation of which he was not the object <\s>
<s> if said i it were in the power of a biographer to relate the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth the friends and surviving kindred of the deceased for the sake of general benefit to mankind might endure that such heart rending communication should be made to the world <\s>
<s> but in no case is this possible and in the present the opportunities of directly acquiring other than superficial knowledge have been most scanty for the writer has barely seen the person who is the subject of his tale nor did his avocations allow him to take the pains necessary for ascertaining what portion of the information conveyed to him was authentic <\s>
<s> so much for facts and actions and to what purpose relate them even were they true if the narrative cannot be heard without extreme pain unless they are placed in such a light and brought forward in such order that they shall explain their own laws and leave the reader in as little uncertainty as the mysteries of our nature will allow respecting the spirit from which they derived their existence and which governed the agent <\s>
<s> but hear on this pathetic and awful subject the poet himself pleading for those who have transgressed <\s>
<s> one point must still be greatly dark the moving why they do it and just as lamely can ye mark how far perhaps they rue it <\s>
<s> who made the heart tis he alone decidedly can try us he knows each chord its various tone each spring its various bias <\s>
<s> then at the balance let's be mute we never can adjust it what's done we partly may compute but know not what's resisted <\s>
<s> how happened it that the recollection of this affecting passage did not check so amiable a man as dr <\s>
<s> currie while he was revealing to the world the infirmities of its author <\s>
<s> he must have known enough of human nature to be assured that men would be eager to sit in judgment and pronounce decidedly upon the guilt or innocence of burns by his testimony nay that there were multitudes whose main interest in the allegations would be derived from the incitements which they found therein to undertake this presumptuous office <\s>
<s> and where lies the collateral benefit or what ultimate advantage can be expected to counteract the injury that the many are thus tempted to do to their own minds and to compensate the sorrow which must be fixed in the hearts of the considerate few by language that proclaims so much and provokes conjectures as unfavourable as imagination can furnish <\s>
<s> here said i being moved beyond what it would become me to express here is a revolting account of a man of exquisite genius and confessedly of many high moral qualities sunk into the lowest depths of vice and misery <\s>
<s> but the painful story notwithstanding its minuteness is incomplete in essentials it is deficient so that the most attentive and sagacious reader cannot explain how a mind so well established by knowledge fell and continued to fall without power to prevent or retard its own ruin <\s>
<s> would a bosom friend of the author his counsellor and confessor have told such things if true as this book contains <\s>
<s> and who but one possessed of the intimate knowledge which none but a bosom friend can acquire could have been justified in making these avowals <\s>
<s> such a one himself a pure spirit having accompanied as it were upon wings the pilgrim along the sorrowful road which he trod on foot such a one neither hurried down by its slippery descents nor entangled among its thorns nor perplexed by its windings nor discomfited by its founderous passages for the instruction of others might have delineated almost as in a map the way which the afflicted pilgrim had pursued till the sad close of his diversified journey <\s>
<s> in this manner the venerable spirit of isaac walton was qualified to have retraced the unsteady course of a highly gifted man who in this lamentable point and in versatility of genius bore no unobvious resemblance to the scottish bard i mean his friend cotton whom notwithstanding all that the sage must have disapproved in his life he honoured with the title of son <\s>
<s> nothing like this however has the biographer of burns accomplished and with his means of information copious as in some respects they were it would have been absurd to attempt it <\s>
<s> the only motive therefore which could authorize the writing and publishing matter so distressing to read is wanting <\s>
<s> currie's performance censurable from these considerations alone for information which would have been of absolute worth if in his capacity of biographer and editor he had known when to stop short is rendered unsatisfactory and inefficacious through the absence of this reserve and from being coupled with statements of improbable and irreconcileable facts <\s>
<s> we have the author's letters discharged upon us in showers but how few readers will take the trouble of comparing those letters with each other and with the other documents of the publication in order to come at a genuine knowledge of the writer's character the life of johnson by boswell had broken through many pre existing delicacies and afforded the british public an opportunity of acquiring experience which before it had happily wanted nevertheless at the time when the ill selected medley of burns's correspondence first appeared little progress had been made nor is it likely that by the mass of mankind much ever will be made in determining what portion of these confidential communications escapes the pen in courteous yet often innocent compliance to gratify the several tastes of correspondents and as little towards distinguishing opinions and sentiments uttered for the momentary amusement merely of the writer's own fancy from those which his judgment deliberately approves and his heart faithfully cherishes <\s>
<s> but the subject of this book was a man of extraordinary genius whose birth education and employments had placed and kept him in a situation far below that in which the writers and readers of expensive volumes are usually found <\s>
<s> critics upon works of fiction have laid it down as a rule that remoteness of place in fixing the choice of a subject and in prescribing the mode of treating it is equal in effect to distance of time restraints may be thrown off accordingly <\s>
<s> judge then of the delusions which artificial distinctions impose when to a man like doctor currie writing with views so honourable the social condition of the individual of whom he was treating could seem to place him at such a distance from the exalted reader that ceremony might he discarded with him and his memory sacrificed as it were almost without compunction <\s>
<s> the poet was laid where these injuries could not reach him but he had a parent i understand an admirable woman still surviving a brother like gilbert burns a widow estimable for her virtues and children at that time infants with the world before them which they must face to obtain a maintenance who remembered their father probably with the tenderest affection and whose opening minds as their years advanced would become conscious of so many reasons for admiring him ill fated child of nature too frequently thine own enemy unhappy favourite of genius too often misguided this is indeed to be crushed beneath the furrow's weight <\s>
<s> why sir do i write to you at this length when all that i had to express in direct answer to the request which occasioned this letter lay in such narrow compass because having entered upon the subject i am unable to quit it your feelings i trust go along with mine and rising from this individual case to a general view of the subject you will probably agree with me in opinion that biography though differing in some essentials from works of fiction is nevertheless like them an art an art the laws of which are determined by the imperfections of our nature and the constitution of society <\s>
<s> truth is not here as in the sciences and in natural philosophy to be sought without scruple and promulgated for its own sake upon the mere chance of its being serviceable but only for obviously justifying purposes moral or intellectual <\s>
<s> silence is a privilege of the grave a right of the departed let him therefore who infringes that right by speaking publicly of for or against those who cannot speak for themselves take heed that he opens not his mouth without a sufficient sanction <\s>
<s> de mortuis nil nisi bonum is a rule in which these sentiments have been pushed to an extreme that proves how deeply humanity is interested in maintaining them <\s>
<s> and it was wise to announce the precept thus absolutely both because there exist in that same nature by which it has been dictated so many temptations to disregard it and because there are powers and influences within and without us that will prevent its being literally fulfilled to the suppression of profitable truth <\s>
<s> penalties of law conventions of manners and personal fear protect the reputation of the living and something of this protection is extended to the recently dead who survive to a certain degree in their kindred and friends <\s>

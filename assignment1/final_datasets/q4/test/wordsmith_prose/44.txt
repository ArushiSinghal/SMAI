<s> i went therefore and took myself a lodging as near to his house which was then in jewin street as conveniently i could and from thenceforward went every day in the afternoon except on the first days of the week and sitting by him in his dining room read to him in such books in the latin tongue as he pleased to hear me read <\s>
<s> the oaks ambleside jan <\s>
<s> we dined to day at rydal mount <\s>
<s> wordsworth during dinner grave and silent till on some remark having been made on the present condition of the church he most unreservedly gave his own views and gave expression as i have only once heard him give before to his own earnest devout humble feelings as a christian <\s>
<s> in the evening being led by some previous conversation to speak of st <\s>
<s> paul he said oh what a character that is <\s>
<s> how well we know him <\s>
<s> how human yet how noble <\s>
<s> how little outward sufferings moved him <\s>

<s> april 7 1846 i went to the mount to day to pay my respects to mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth on his birthday <\s>
<s> i found him and dear mrs <\s>
<s> wordsworth very happy in the arrival of their four grandsons <\s>
<s> the two elder are to go to rossall next week <\s>
<s> some talk concerning schools led mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth into a discourse which in relation to himself i thought very interesting on the dangers of emulation as used in the way of help to school progress <\s>
<s> wordsworth thinks that envy is too likely to go along with this and therefore would hold it to be unsafe <\s>
<s> in my own case he said i never felt emulation with another man but once and that was accompanied by envy <\s>
<s> it is a horrid feeling <\s>
<s> this once was in the study of italian which he continued i entered on at college along with i forget the name he mentioned <\s>
<s> i never engaged in the proper studies of the university so that in these i had no temptation to envy any one but i remember with pain that i had envious feelings when my fellow student in italian got before me <\s>
<s> i was his superior in many departments of mind but he was the better italian scholar and i envied him <\s>
<s> the annoyance this gave me made me feel that emulation was dangerous for me and it made me very thankful that as a boy i never experienced it <\s>
<s> i felt very early the force of the words be ye perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect and as a teacher or friend or counsellor of youth i would hold forth no other motive to exertion than this <\s>
<s> there is i think none other held forth in the gospels <\s>
<s> no permission is given to emulation there .... <\s>
<s> there must always be a danger of incurring the passion of vanity by emulation <\s>
<s> if we try to outstrip a fellow creature and succeed we may naturally enough be proud <\s>
<s> the true lesson of humility is to strive after conformity to that excellence which we never can surpass never even by a great distance attain to <\s>
<s> there was in the whole manner as well as matter of mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth's discourse on this subject a deep veneration for the will of god concerning us which i shall long remember with interest and delight i hope with profit <\s>

<s> in a morning visit by our fireside to day from mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth something led to the mention of milton whose poetry he said was earlier a favourite with him than that of shakspeare <\s>
<s> speaking of milton's not allowing his daughters to learn the meaning of the greek they read to him or at least not exerting himself to teach it to them he admitted that this seemed to betoken a low estimate of the condition and purposes of the female mind <\s>
<s> and yet where could he have picked up such notions said mr <\s>
<s> w in a country which had seen so many women of learning and talent <\s>
<s> but his opinion of what women ought to be it may be presumed is given in the unfallen eve as contrasted with the right condition of man before his maker he for god only she for god in him <\s>
<s> now that said mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth earnestly is a low a very low and a very false estimate of woman's condition <\s>
<s> he was amused on my showing him the almost contemporary notice of milton by wycherly and after reading it spoke a good deal of the obscurity of men of genius in or near their own times <\s>
<s> but the most singular thing he continued is that in all the writings of bacon there is not one allusion to shakspeare <\s>
<s> a long fireside visit from mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth this morning in highly sociable spirits speaking much of old days and old acquaintances <\s>
<s> he spoke with much regret of scott's careless views about money and said that he had often spoken to him of the duty of economy as a means to insure literary independence <\s>
<s> scott's reply always was oh i can make as much as i please by writing <\s>
<s> w was marvellous to me who had never written a line with a view to profit <\s>
<s> speaking of his own prose writing he said that but for coleridge's irregularity of purpose he should probably have left much more in that kind behind him <\s>
<s> when coleridge was proposing to publish his friend he mr <\s>
<s> coleridge expressed himself pleased with the offer but said i must arrange my principles for the work and when that is done i shall be glad of your aid <\s>
<s> but this arrangement of principles never took place <\s>

<s> wordsworth 251 will after my death collect and publish all i have written in prose <\s>
<s> on this day as i have heard him more than once before mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth in a way very earnest and to me very impressive and remarkable disclaimed all value for all concern about posthumous fame 252 e conversations and reminiscences recorded by the now bishop of lincoln c <\s>
<s> remember first read the ancient classical authors then come to us and you will be able to judge for yourself which of us is worth reading <\s>
<s> the first book of homer appears to be independent of the rest <\s>
<s> the plan of the odyssey is more methodical than that of the iliad <\s>
<s> the character of achilles seems to me one of the grandest ever conceived <\s>
<s> there is something awful in it particularly in the circumstance of his acting under an abiding foresight of his own death <\s>
<s> one day conversing with payne knight and uvedale price concerning homer i expressed my admiration of nestor's speech as eminently natural where he tells the greek leaders that they are mere children in comparison with the heroes of old whom he had known 253 <\s>

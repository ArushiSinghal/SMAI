<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>
<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>
<s> a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our allies in asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given <\s>
<s> but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reason conciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commanding and repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind <\s>
<s> even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it <\s>
<s> we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life <\s>
<s> it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weakness if it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride <\s>
<s> the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong <\s>
<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>
<s> i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted <\s>
<s> there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the well intentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained <\s>
<s> therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those ill fated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that government to look for it if it were hidden to call it forth and by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights <\s>
<s> or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative <\s>
<s> in whatever circumstances portugal had been placed the paramount right of the portugueze nation or government to appear not merely as a party but a principal ought to have been established as a primary position without the admission of which all proposals to treat would be peremptorily rejected <\s>
<s> but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince <\s>
<s> well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation <\s>
<s> i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption <\s>
<s> nor would the evil be merely negative for the interference of professed friends acting in this manner must have superinduced dispositions and passions which were alien to the condition of the portugueze scattered weeds which could not have been found upon the soil if our ignorant hands had not sown them <\s>
<s> of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the threshold but i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted <\s>
<s> let us then proceed <\s>
<s> by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army <\s>
<s> are to the same effect determining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged <\s>
<s> the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments <\s>
<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>
<s> should be delivered immediately to the portugueze government would the delivering up of them wipe away the affront <\s>
<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>

<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>
<s> it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their power yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away <\s>
<s> and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends <\s>
<s> the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms <\s>
<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>
<s> the nation required that the french should surrender at discretion grant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatience we were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender <\s>
<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>
<s> and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot <\s>
<s> had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other <\s>
<s> nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater <\s>
<s> yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners <\s>
<s> the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected <\s>
<s> a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary <\s>
<s> what was this but implying that it was dishonourable and that it would frustrate the efforts which his country was making and destroy the hopes which it had built upon its own power <\s>
<s> another letter from a magistrate inveighs against the convention as leaving the crimes of the french in portugal unpunished as giving no indemnification for all the murders robberies and atrocities which had been committed by them <\s>
<s> but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further <\s>
<s> i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all <\s>
<s> and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person <\s>
<s> if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one <\s>
<s> as to the fact it appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the person each has written down with his own hand i am the man <\s>
<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>
<s> men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed <\s>
<s> these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people <\s>
<s> it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actions from no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature <\s>
<s> let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalize and therefore degrade the human being he will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society <\s>
<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>

<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>
<s> a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our allies in asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given <\s>
<s> but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reason conciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commanding and repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind <\s>
<s> even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it <\s>
<s> we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life <\s>
<s> it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weakness if it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride <\s>
<s> the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong <\s>
<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>
<s> i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted <\s>
<s> there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the well intentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained <\s>
<s> therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those ill fated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that government to look for it if it were hidden to call it forth and by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights <\s>
<s> or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative <\s>
<s> in whatever circumstances portugal had been placed the paramount right of the portugueze nation or government to appear not merely as a party but a principal ought to have been established as a primary position without the admission of which all proposals to treat would be peremptorily rejected <\s>
<s> but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince <\s>
<s> well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation <\s>
<s> i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption <\s>
<s> nor would the evil be merely negative for the interference of professed friends acting in this manner must have superinduced dispositions and passions which were alien to the condition of the portugueze scattered weeds which could not have been found upon the soil if our ignorant hands had not sown them <\s>
<s> of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the threshold but i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted <\s>
<s> let us then proceed <\s>
<s> by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army <\s>
<s> are to the same effect determining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged <\s>
<s> the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments <\s>
<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>
<s> should be delivered immediately to the portugueze government would the delivering up of them wipe away the affront <\s>
<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>
<s> but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare <\s>
<s> or in a treaty of to day have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday <\s>
<s> eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both <\s>
<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>

<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>
<s> it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their power yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away <\s>
<s> and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends <\s>
<s> the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms <\s>
<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>
<s> the nation required that the french should surrender at discretion grant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatience we were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender <\s>
<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>
<s> and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot <\s>
<s> had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other <\s>
<s> nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater <\s>
<s> yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners <\s>
<s> the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected <\s>
<s> a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary <\s>
<s> what was this but implying that it was dishonourable and that it would frustrate the efforts which his country was making and destroy the hopes which it had built upon its own power <\s>
<s> another letter from a magistrate inveighs against the convention as leaving the crimes of the french in portugal unpunished as giving no indemnification for all the murders robberies and atrocities which had been committed by them <\s>
<s> but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further <\s>
<s> i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all <\s>
<s> and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person <\s>
<s> if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one <\s>
<s> as to the fact it appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the person each has written down with his own hand i am the man <\s>
<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>
<s> men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed <\s>
<s> these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people <\s>
<s> it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actions from no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature <\s>
<s> let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalize and therefore degrade the human being he will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society <\s>
<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>
<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>

<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>

<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>
<s> a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our allies in asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given <\s>
<s> but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reason conciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commanding and repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind <\s>
<s> even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it <\s>
<s> we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life <\s>
<s> it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weakness if it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride <\s>
<s> the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong <\s>
<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>
<s> i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted <\s>
<s> there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the well intentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained <\s>
<s> therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those ill fated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that government to look for it if it were hidden to call it forth and by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights <\s>
<s> or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative <\s>
<s> in whatever circumstances portugal had been placed the paramount right of the portugueze nation or government to appear not merely as a party but a principal ought to have been established as a primary position without the admission of which all proposals to treat would be peremptorily rejected <\s>
<s> but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince <\s>
<s> well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation <\s>
<s> i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption <\s>
<s> nor would the evil be merely negative for the interference of professed friends acting in this manner must have superinduced dispositions and passions which were alien to the condition of the portugueze scattered weeds which could not have been found upon the soil if our ignorant hands had not sown them <\s>
<s> of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the threshold but i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted <\s>
<s> let us then proceed <\s>
<s> by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army <\s>
<s> are to the same effect determining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged <\s>
<s> the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments <\s>
<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>
<s> should be delivered immediately to the portugueze government would the delivering up of them wipe away the affront <\s>
<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>
<s> but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare <\s>
<s> or in a treaty of to day have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday <\s>
<s> eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both <\s>
<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>

<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>

<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>
<s> and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot <\s>
<s> had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other <\s>
<s> nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater <\s>
<s> yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners <\s>
<s> the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected <\s>
<s> a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary <\s>
<s> what was this but implying that it was dishonourable and that it would frustrate the efforts which his country was making and destroy the hopes which it had built upon its own power <\s>
<s> another letter from a magistrate inveighs against the convention as leaving the crimes of the french in portugal unpunished as giving no indemnification for all the murders robberies and atrocities which had been committed by them <\s>
<s> but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further <\s>
<s> i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all <\s>
<s> and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person <\s>
<s> if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one <\s>
<s> as to the fact it appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the person each has written down with his own hand i am the man <\s>
<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>
<s> men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed <\s>
<s> these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people <\s>
<s> it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actions from no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature <\s>
<s> let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalize and therefore degrade the human being he will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society <\s>
<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>
<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>

<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>

<s> therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those ill fated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that government to look for it if it were hidden to call it forth and by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights <\s>
<s> or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative <\s>

<s> but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince <\s>
<s> well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation <\s>
<s> i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption <\s>
<s> nor would the evil be merely negative for the interference of professed friends acting in this manner must have superinduced dispositions and passions which were alien to the condition of the portugueze scattered weeds which could not have been found upon the soil if our ignorant hands had not sown them <\s>
<s> of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the threshold but i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted <\s>
<s> let us then proceed <\s>
<s> by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army <\s>
<s> are to the same effect determining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged <\s>
<s> the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments <\s>
<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>
<s> should be delivered immediately to the portugueze government would the delivering up of them wipe away the affront <\s>
<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>
<s> but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare <\s>
<s> or in a treaty of to day have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday <\s>
<s> eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both <\s>
<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>
<s> it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their power yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away <\s>
<s> and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends <\s>
<s> the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms <\s>
<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>
<s> the nation required that the french should surrender at discretion grant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatience we were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender <\s>
<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>

<s> but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further <\s>
<s> i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all <\s>
<s> and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person <\s>
<s> if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one <\s>
<s> as to the fact it appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the person each has written down with his own hand i am the man <\s>
<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>
<s> men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed <\s>
<s> these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people <\s>
<s> it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actions from no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature <\s>
<s> let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalize and therefore degrade the human being he will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society <\s>
<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>
<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>
<s> a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our allies in asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given <\s>
<s> but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reason conciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commanding and repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind <\s>
<s> even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it <\s>
<s> we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life <\s>
<s> it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weakness if it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride <\s>
<s> the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong <\s>
<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>
<s> i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted <\s>
<s> there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the well intentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained <\s>

<s> of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the threshold but i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted <\s>
<s> let us then proceed <\s>
<s> by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army <\s>
<s> are to the same effect determining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged <\s>
<s> the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments <\s>
<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>
<s> should be delivered immediately to the portugueze government would the delivering up of them wipe away the affront <\s>
<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>
<s> but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare <\s>
<s> or in a treaty of to day have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday <\s>
<s> eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both <\s>
<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>
<s> it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their power yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away <\s>
<s> and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends <\s>
<s> the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms <\s>
<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>
<s> the nation required that the french should surrender at discretion grant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatience we were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender <\s>
<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>
<s> and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot <\s>
<s> had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other <\s>
<s> nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater <\s>
<s> yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners <\s>
<s> the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected <\s>
<s> a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary <\s>

<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>
<s> men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed <\s>
<s> these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people <\s>
<s> it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actions from no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature <\s>
<s> let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalize and therefore degrade the human being he will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society <\s>
<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>
<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>
<s> a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our allies in asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given <\s>
<s> but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reason conciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commanding and repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind <\s>
<s> even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it <\s>
<s> we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life <\s>
<s> it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weakness if it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride <\s>
<s> the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong <\s>
<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>
<s> i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted <\s>
<s> there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the well intentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained <\s>
<s> therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those ill fated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that government to look for it if it were hidden to call it forth and by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights <\s>
<s> or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative <\s>
<s> in whatever circumstances portugal had been placed the paramount right of the portugueze nation or government to appear not merely as a party but a principal ought to have been established as a primary position without the admission of which all proposals to treat would be peremptorily rejected <\s>
<s> but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince <\s>
<s> well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation <\s>
<s> i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption <\s>

<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>

<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>
<s> but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare <\s>
<s> or in a treaty of to day have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday <\s>
<s> eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both <\s>
<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>
<s> it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their power yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away <\s>
<s> and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends <\s>
<s> the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms <\s>
<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>
<s> the nation required that the french should surrender at discretion grant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatience we were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender <\s>
<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>
<s> and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot <\s>
<s> had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other <\s>
<s> nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater <\s>
<s> yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners <\s>
<s> the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected <\s>
<s> a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary <\s>
<s> what was this but implying that it was dishonourable and that it would frustrate the efforts which his country was making and destroy the hopes which it had built upon its own power <\s>
<s> another letter from a magistrate inveighs against the convention as leaving the crimes of the french in portugal unpunished as giving no indemnification for all the murders robberies and atrocities which had been committed by them <\s>
<s> but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further <\s>
<s> i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all <\s>
<s> and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person <\s>
<s> if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one <\s>
<s> as to the fact it appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the person each has written down with his own hand i am the man <\s>
<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>

<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>
<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>
<s> a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our allies in asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given <\s>
<s> but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reason conciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commanding and repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind <\s>
<s> even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it <\s>
<s> we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life <\s>
<s> it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weakness if it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride <\s>
<s> the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong <\s>
<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>
<s> i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted <\s>
<s> there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the well intentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained <\s>
<s> therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those ill fated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that government to look for it if it were hidden to call it forth and by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights <\s>
<s> or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative <\s>
<s> in whatever circumstances portugal had been placed the paramount right of the portugueze nation or government to appear not merely as a party but a principal ought to have been established as a primary position without the admission of which all proposals to treat would be peremptorily rejected <\s>
<s> but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince <\s>
<s> well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation <\s>
<s> i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption <\s>
<s> nor would the evil be merely negative for the interference of professed friends acting in this manner must have superinduced dispositions and passions which were alien to the condition of the portugueze scattered weeds which could not have been found upon the soil if our ignorant hands had not sown them <\s>
<s> of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the threshold but i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted <\s>
<s> let us then proceed <\s>
<s> by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army <\s>
<s> are to the same effect determining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged <\s>
<s> the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments <\s>
<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>
<s> should be delivered immediately to the portugueze government would the delivering up of them wipe away the affront <\s>
<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>

<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>
<s> it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their power yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away <\s>
<s> and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends <\s>
<s> the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms <\s>
<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>
<s> the nation required that the french should surrender at discretion grant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatience we were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender <\s>
<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>
<s> and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot <\s>
<s> had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other <\s>
<s> nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater <\s>
<s> yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners <\s>
<s> the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected <\s>
<s> a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary <\s>
<s> what was this but implying that it was dishonourable and that it would frustrate the efforts which his country was making and destroy the hopes which it had built upon its own power <\s>
<s> another letter from a magistrate inveighs against the convention as leaving the crimes of the french in portugal unpunished as giving no indemnification for all the murders robberies and atrocities which had been committed by them <\s>
<s> but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further <\s>
<s> i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all <\s>
<s> and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person <\s>
<s> if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one <\s>
<s> as to the fact it appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the person each has written down with his own hand i am the man <\s>
<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>
<s> men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed <\s>
<s> these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people <\s>
<s> it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actions from no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature <\s>
<s> let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalize and therefore degrade the human being he will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society <\s>
<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>

<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>
<s> a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our allies in asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given <\s>
<s> but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reason conciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commanding and repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind <\s>
<s> even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it <\s>
<s> we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life <\s>
<s> it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weakness if it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride <\s>
<s> the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong <\s>
<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>
<s> i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted <\s>
<s> there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the well intentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained <\s>
<s> therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those ill fated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that government to look for it if it were hidden to call it forth and by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights <\s>
<s> or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative <\s>
<s> in whatever circumstances portugal had been placed the paramount right of the portugueze nation or government to appear not merely as a party but a principal ought to have been established as a primary position without the admission of which all proposals to treat would be peremptorily rejected <\s>
<s> but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince <\s>
<s> well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation <\s>
<s> i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption <\s>
<s> nor would the evil be merely negative for the interference of professed friends acting in this manner must have superinduced dispositions and passions which were alien to the condition of the portugueze scattered weeds which could not have been found upon the soil if our ignorant hands had not sown them <\s>
<s> of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the threshold but i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted <\s>
<s> let us then proceed <\s>
<s> by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army <\s>
<s> are to the same effect determining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged <\s>
<s> the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments <\s>
<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>
<s> should be delivered immediately to the portugueze government would the delivering up of them wipe away the affront <\s>
<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>
<s> but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare <\s>
<s> or in a treaty of to day have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday <\s>
<s> eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both <\s>
<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>

<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>
<s> it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their power yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away <\s>
<s> and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends <\s>
<s> the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms <\s>
<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>
<s> the nation required that the french should surrender at discretion grant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatience we were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender <\s>
<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>
<s> and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot <\s>
<s> had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other <\s>
<s> nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater <\s>
<s> yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners <\s>
<s> the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected <\s>
<s> a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary <\s>
<s> what was this but implying that it was dishonourable and that it would frustrate the efforts which his country was making and destroy the hopes which it had built upon its own power <\s>
<s> another letter from a magistrate inveighs against the convention as leaving the crimes of the french in portugal unpunished as giving no indemnification for all the murders robberies and atrocities which had been committed by them <\s>
<s> but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further <\s>
<s> i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all <\s>
<s> and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person <\s>
<s> if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one <\s>
<s> as to the fact it appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the person each has written down with his own hand i am the man <\s>
<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>
<s> men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed <\s>
<s> these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people <\s>
<s> it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actions from no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature <\s>
<s> let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalize and therefore degrade the human being he will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society <\s>
<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>
<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>

<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>

<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>
<s> a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our allies in asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given <\s>
<s> but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reason conciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commanding and repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind <\s>
<s> even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it <\s>
<s> we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life <\s>
<s> it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weakness if it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride <\s>
<s> the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong <\s>
<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>
<s> i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted <\s>
<s> there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the well intentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained <\s>
<s> therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those ill fated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that government to look for it if it were hidden to call it forth and by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights <\s>
<s> or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative <\s>
<s> in whatever circumstances portugal had been placed the paramount right of the portugueze nation or government to appear not merely as a party but a principal ought to have been established as a primary position without the admission of which all proposals to treat would be peremptorily rejected <\s>
<s> but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince <\s>
<s> well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation <\s>
<s> i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption <\s>
<s> nor would the evil be merely negative for the interference of professed friends acting in this manner must have superinduced dispositions and passions which were alien to the condition of the portugueze scattered weeds which could not have been found upon the soil if our ignorant hands had not sown them <\s>
<s> of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the threshold but i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted <\s>
<s> let us then proceed <\s>
<s> by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army <\s>
<s> are to the same effect determining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged <\s>
<s> the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments <\s>
<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>
<s> should be delivered immediately to the portugueze government would the delivering up of them wipe away the affront <\s>
<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>
<s> but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare <\s>
<s> or in a treaty of to day have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday <\s>
<s> eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both <\s>
<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>

<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>

<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>
<s> and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot <\s>
<s> had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other <\s>
<s> nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater <\s>
<s> yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners <\s>
<s> the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected <\s>
<s> a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary <\s>
<s> what was this but implying that it was dishonourable and that it would frustrate the efforts which his country was making and destroy the hopes which it had built upon its own power <\s>
<s> another letter from a magistrate inveighs against the convention as leaving the crimes of the french in portugal unpunished as giving no indemnification for all the murders robberies and atrocities which had been committed by them <\s>
<s> but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further <\s>
<s> i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all <\s>
<s> and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person <\s>
<s> if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one <\s>
<s> as to the fact it appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the person each has written down with his own hand i am the man <\s>
<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>
<s> men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed <\s>
<s> these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people <\s>
<s> it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actions from no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature <\s>
<s> let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalize and therefore degrade the human being he will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society <\s>
<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>
<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>

<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>

<s> therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those ill fated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that government to look for it if it were hidden to call it forth and by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights <\s>
<s> or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative <\s>

<s> but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince <\s>
<s> well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation <\s>
<s> i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption <\s>
<s> nor would the evil be merely negative for the interference of professed friends acting in this manner must have superinduced dispositions and passions which were alien to the condition of the portugueze scattered weeds which could not have been found upon the soil if our ignorant hands had not sown them <\s>
<s> of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the threshold but i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted <\s>
<s> let us then proceed <\s>
<s> by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army <\s>
<s> are to the same effect determining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged <\s>
<s> the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments <\s>
<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>
<s> should be delivered immediately to the portugueze government would the delivering up of them wipe away the affront <\s>
<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>
<s> but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare <\s>
<s> or in a treaty of to day have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday <\s>
<s> eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both <\s>
<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>
<s> it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their power yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away <\s>
<s> and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends <\s>
<s> the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms <\s>
<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>
<s> the nation required that the french should surrender at discretion grant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatience we were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender <\s>
<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>

<s> but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further <\s>
<s> i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all <\s>
<s> and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person <\s>
<s> if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one <\s>
<s> as to the fact it appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the person each has written down with his own hand i am the man <\s>
<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>
<s> men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed <\s>
<s> these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people <\s>
<s> it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actions from no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature <\s>
<s> let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalize and therefore degrade the human being he will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society <\s>
<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>
<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>
<s> a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our allies in asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given <\s>
<s> but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reason conciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commanding and repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind <\s>
<s> even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it <\s>
<s> we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life <\s>
<s> it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weakness if it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride <\s>
<s> the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong <\s>
<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>
<s> i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted <\s>
<s> there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the well intentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained <\s>

<s> of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the threshold but i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted <\s>
<s> let us then proceed <\s>
<s> by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army <\s>
<s> are to the same effect determining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged <\s>
<s> the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments <\s>
<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>
<s> should be delivered immediately to the portugueze government would the delivering up of them wipe away the affront <\s>
<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>
<s> but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare <\s>
<s> or in a treaty of to day have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday <\s>
<s> eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both <\s>
<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>
<s> it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their power yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away <\s>
<s> and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends <\s>
<s> the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms <\s>
<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>
<s> the nation required that the french should surrender at discretion grant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatience we were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender <\s>
<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>
<s> and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot <\s>
<s> had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other <\s>
<s> nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater <\s>
<s> yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners <\s>
<s> the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected <\s>
<s> a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary <\s>

<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>
<s> men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed <\s>
<s> these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people <\s>
<s> it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actions from no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature <\s>
<s> let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalize and therefore degrade the human being he will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society <\s>
<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>
<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>
<s> a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our allies in asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given <\s>
<s> but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reason conciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commanding and repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind <\s>
<s> even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it <\s>
<s> we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life <\s>
<s> it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weakness if it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride <\s>
<s> the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong <\s>
<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>
<s> i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted <\s>
<s> there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the well intentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained <\s>
<s> therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those ill fated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that government to look for it if it were hidden to call it forth and by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights <\s>
<s> or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative <\s>
<s> in whatever circumstances portugal had been placed the paramount right of the portugueze nation or government to appear not merely as a party but a principal ought to have been established as a primary position without the admission of which all proposals to treat would be peremptorily rejected <\s>
<s> but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince <\s>
<s> well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation <\s>
<s> i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption <\s>

<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>

<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>
<s> but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare <\s>
<s> or in a treaty of to day have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday <\s>
<s> eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both <\s>
<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>
<s> it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their power yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away <\s>
<s> and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends <\s>
<s> the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms <\s>
<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>
<s> the nation required that the french should surrender at discretion grant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatience we were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender <\s>
<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>
<s> and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot <\s>
<s> had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other <\s>
<s> nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater <\s>
<s> yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners <\s>
<s> the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected <\s>
<s> a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary <\s>
<s> what was this but implying that it was dishonourable and that it would frustrate the efforts which his country was making and destroy the hopes which it had built upon its own power <\s>
<s> another letter from a magistrate inveighs against the convention as leaving the crimes of the french in portugal unpunished as giving no indemnification for all the murders robberies and atrocities which had been committed by them <\s>
<s> but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further <\s>
<s> i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all <\s>
<s> and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person <\s>
<s> if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one <\s>
<s> as to the fact it appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the person each has written down with his own hand i am the man <\s>
<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>

<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>
<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>
<s> a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our allies in asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given <\s>
<s> but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reason conciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commanding and repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind <\s>
<s> even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it <\s>
<s> we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life <\s>
<s> it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weakness if it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride <\s>
<s> the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong <\s>
<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>
<s> i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted <\s>
<s> there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the well intentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained <\s>
<s> therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those ill fated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that government to look for it if it were hidden to call it forth and by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights <\s>
<s> or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative <\s>
<s> in whatever circumstances portugal had been placed the paramount right of the portugueze nation or government to appear not merely as a party but a principal ought to have been established as a primary position without the admission of which all proposals to treat would be peremptorily rejected <\s>
<s> but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince <\s>
<s> well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation <\s>
<s> i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption <\s>
<s> nor would the evil be merely negative for the interference of professed friends acting in this manner must have superinduced dispositions and passions which were alien to the condition of the portugueze scattered weeds which could not have been found upon the soil if our ignorant hands had not sown them <\s>
<s> of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the threshold but i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted <\s>
<s> let us then proceed <\s>
<s> by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army <\s>
<s> are to the same effect determining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged <\s>
<s> the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments <\s>
<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>
<s> should be delivered immediately to the portugueze government would the delivering up of them wipe away the affront <\s>
<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>

<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>
<s> it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their power yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away <\s>
<s> and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends <\s>
<s> the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms <\s>
<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>
<s> the nation required that the french should surrender at discretion grant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatience we were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender <\s>
<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>
<s> and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot <\s>
<s> had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other <\s>
<s> nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater <\s>
<s> yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners <\s>
<s> the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected <\s>
<s> a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary <\s>
<s> what was this but implying that it was dishonourable and that it would frustrate the efforts which his country was making and destroy the hopes which it had built upon its own power <\s>
<s> another letter from a magistrate inveighs against the convention as leaving the crimes of the french in portugal unpunished as giving no indemnification for all the murders robberies and atrocities which had been committed by them <\s>
<s> but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further <\s>
<s> i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all <\s>
<s> and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person <\s>
<s> if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one <\s>
<s> as to the fact it appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the person each has written down with his own hand i am the man <\s>
<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>
<s> men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed <\s>
<s> these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people <\s>
<s> it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actions from no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature <\s>
<s> let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalize and therefore degrade the human being he will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society <\s>
<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>

<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>
<s> a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our allies in asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given <\s>
<s> but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reason conciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commanding and repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind <\s>
<s> even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it <\s>
<s> we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life <\s>
<s> it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weakness if it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride <\s>
<s> the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong <\s>
<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>
<s> i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted <\s>
<s> there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the well intentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained <\s>
<s> therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those ill fated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that government to look for it if it were hidden to call it forth and by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights <\s>
<s> or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative <\s>
<s> in whatever circumstances portugal had been placed the paramount right of the portugueze nation or government to appear not merely as a party but a principal ought to have been established as a primary position without the admission of which all proposals to treat would be peremptorily rejected <\s>
<s> but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince <\s>
<s> well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation <\s>
<s> i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption <\s>
<s> nor would the evil be merely negative for the interference of professed friends acting in this manner must have superinduced dispositions and passions which were alien to the condition of the portugueze scattered weeds which could not have been found upon the soil if our ignorant hands had not sown them <\s>
<s> of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the threshold but i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted <\s>
<s> let us then proceed <\s>
<s> by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army <\s>
<s> are to the same effect determining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged <\s>
<s> the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments <\s>
<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>
<s> should be delivered immediately to the portugueze government would the delivering up of them wipe away the affront <\s>
<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>
<s> but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare <\s>
<s> or in a treaty of to day have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday <\s>
<s> eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both <\s>
<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>

<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>
<s> it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their power yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away <\s>
<s> and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends <\s>
<s> the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms <\s>
<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>
<s> the nation required that the french should surrender at discretion grant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatience we were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender <\s>
<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>
<s> and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot <\s>
<s> had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other <\s>
<s> nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater <\s>
<s> yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners <\s>
<s> the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected <\s>
<s> a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary <\s>
<s> what was this but implying that it was dishonourable and that it would frustrate the efforts which his country was making and destroy the hopes which it had built upon its own power <\s>
<s> another letter from a magistrate inveighs against the convention as leaving the crimes of the french in portugal unpunished as giving no indemnification for all the murders robberies and atrocities which had been committed by them <\s>
<s> but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further <\s>
<s> i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all <\s>
<s> and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person <\s>
<s> if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one <\s>
<s> as to the fact it appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the person each has written down with his own hand i am the man <\s>
<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>
<s> men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed <\s>
<s> these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people <\s>
<s> it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actions from no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature <\s>
<s> let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalize and therefore degrade the human being he will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society <\s>
<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>
<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>

<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>

<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>
<s> a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our allies in asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given <\s>
<s> but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reason conciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commanding and repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind <\s>
<s> even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it <\s>
<s> we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life <\s>
<s> it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weakness if it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride <\s>
<s> the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong <\s>
<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>
<s> i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted <\s>
<s> there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the well intentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained <\s>
<s> therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those ill fated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that government to look for it if it were hidden to call it forth and by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights <\s>
<s> or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative <\s>
<s> in whatever circumstances portugal had been placed the paramount right of the portugueze nation or government to appear not merely as a party but a principal ought to have been established as a primary position without the admission of which all proposals to treat would be peremptorily rejected <\s>
<s> but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince <\s>
<s> well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation <\s>
<s> i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption <\s>
<s> nor would the evil be merely negative for the interference of professed friends acting in this manner must have superinduced dispositions and passions which were alien to the condition of the portugueze scattered weeds which could not have been found upon the soil if our ignorant hands had not sown them <\s>
<s> of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the threshold but i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted <\s>
<s> let us then proceed <\s>
<s> by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army <\s>
<s> are to the same effect determining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged <\s>
<s> the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments <\s>
<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>
<s> should be delivered immediately to the portugueze government would the delivering up of them wipe away the affront <\s>
<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>
<s> but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare <\s>
<s> or in a treaty of to day have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday <\s>
<s> eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both <\s>
<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>

<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>

<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>
<s> and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot <\s>
<s> had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other <\s>
<s> nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater <\s>
<s> yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners <\s>
<s> the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected <\s>
<s> a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary <\s>
<s> what was this but implying that it was dishonourable and that it would frustrate the efforts which his country was making and destroy the hopes which it had built upon its own power <\s>
<s> another letter from a magistrate inveighs against the convention as leaving the crimes of the french in portugal unpunished as giving no indemnification for all the murders robberies and atrocities which had been committed by them <\s>
<s> but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further <\s>
<s> i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all <\s>
<s> and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person <\s>
<s> if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one <\s>
<s> as to the fact it appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the person each has written down with his own hand i am the man <\s>
<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>
<s> men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed <\s>
<s> these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people <\s>
<s> it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actions from no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature <\s>
<s> let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalize and therefore degrade the human being he will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society <\s>
<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>
<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>

<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>

<s> therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those ill fated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that government to look for it if it were hidden to call it forth and by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights <\s>
<s> or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative <\s>

<s> but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince <\s>
<s> well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation <\s>
<s> i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption <\s>
<s> nor would the evil be merely negative for the interference of professed friends acting in this manner must have superinduced dispositions and passions which were alien to the condition of the portugueze scattered weeds which could not have been found upon the soil if our ignorant hands had not sown them <\s>
<s> of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the threshold but i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted <\s>
<s> let us then proceed <\s>
<s> by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army <\s>
<s> are to the same effect determining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged <\s>
<s> the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments <\s>
<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>
<s> should be delivered immediately to the portugueze government would the delivering up of them wipe away the affront <\s>
<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>
<s> but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare <\s>
<s> or in a treaty of to day have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday <\s>
<s> eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both <\s>
<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>
<s> it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their power yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away <\s>
<s> and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends <\s>
<s> the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms <\s>
<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>
<s> the nation required that the french should surrender at discretion grant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatience we were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender <\s>
<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>

<s> but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further <\s>
<s> i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all <\s>
<s> and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person <\s>
<s> if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one <\s>
<s> as to the fact it appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the person each has written down with his own hand i am the man <\s>
<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>
<s> men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed <\s>
<s> these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people <\s>
<s> it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actions from no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature <\s>
<s> let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalize and therefore degrade the human being he will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society <\s>
<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>
<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>
<s> a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our allies in asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given <\s>
<s> but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reason conciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commanding and repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind <\s>
<s> even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it <\s>
<s> we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life <\s>
<s> it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weakness if it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride <\s>
<s> the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong <\s>
<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>
<s> i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted <\s>
<s> there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the well intentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained <\s>

<s> of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the threshold but i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted <\s>
<s> let us then proceed <\s>
<s> by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army <\s>
<s> are to the same effect determining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged <\s>
<s> the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments <\s>
<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>
<s> should be delivered immediately to the portugueze government would the delivering up of them wipe away the affront <\s>
<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>
<s> but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare <\s>
<s> or in a treaty of to day have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday <\s>
<s> eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both <\s>
<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>
<s> it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their power yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away <\s>
<s> and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends <\s>
<s> the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms <\s>
<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>
<s> the nation required that the french should surrender at discretion grant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatience we were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender <\s>
<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>
<s> and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot <\s>
<s> had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other <\s>
<s> nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater <\s>
<s> yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners <\s>
<s> the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected <\s>
<s> a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary <\s>

<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>
<s> men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed <\s>
<s> these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people <\s>
<s> it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actions from no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature <\s>
<s> let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalize and therefore degrade the human being he will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society <\s>
<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>
<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>
<s> a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our allies in asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given <\s>
<s> but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reason conciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commanding and repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind <\s>
<s> even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it <\s>
<s> we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life <\s>
<s> it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weakness if it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride <\s>
<s> the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong <\s>
<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>
<s> i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted <\s>
<s> there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the well intentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained <\s>
<s> therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those ill fated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that government to look for it if it were hidden to call it forth and by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights <\s>
<s> or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative <\s>
<s> in whatever circumstances portugal had been placed the paramount right of the portugueze nation or government to appear not merely as a party but a principal ought to have been established as a primary position without the admission of which all proposals to treat would be peremptorily rejected <\s>
<s> but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince <\s>
<s> well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation <\s>
<s> i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption <\s>

<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>

<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>
<s> but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare <\s>
<s> or in a treaty of to day have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday <\s>
<s> eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both <\s>
<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>
<s> it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their power yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away <\s>
<s> and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends <\s>
<s> the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms <\s>
<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>
<s> the nation required that the french should surrender at discretion grant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatience we were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender <\s>
<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>
<s> and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot <\s>
<s> had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other <\s>
<s> nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater <\s>
<s> yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners <\s>
<s> the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected <\s>
<s> a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary <\s>
<s> what was this but implying that it was dishonourable and that it would frustrate the efforts which his country was making and destroy the hopes which it had built upon its own power <\s>
<s> another letter from a magistrate inveighs against the convention as leaving the crimes of the french in portugal unpunished as giving no indemnification for all the murders robberies and atrocities which had been committed by them <\s>
<s> but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further <\s>
<s> i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all <\s>
<s> and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person <\s>
<s> if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one <\s>
<s> as to the fact it appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the person each has written down with his own hand i am the man <\s>
<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>

<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>
<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>
<s> a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our allies in asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given <\s>
<s> but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reason conciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commanding and repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind <\s>
<s> even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it <\s>
<s> we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life <\s>
<s> it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weakness if it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride <\s>
<s> the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong <\s>
<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>
<s> i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted <\s>
<s> there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the well intentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained <\s>
<s> therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those ill fated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that government to look for it if it were hidden to call it forth and by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights <\s>
<s> or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative <\s>
<s> in whatever circumstances portugal had been placed the paramount right of the portugueze nation or government to appear not merely as a party but a principal ought to have been established as a primary position without the admission of which all proposals to treat would be peremptorily rejected <\s>
<s> but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince <\s>
<s> well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation <\s>
<s> i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption <\s>
<s> nor would the evil be merely negative for the interference of professed friends acting in this manner must have superinduced dispositions and passions which were alien to the condition of the portugueze scattered weeds which could not have been found upon the soil if our ignorant hands had not sown them <\s>
<s> of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the threshold but i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted <\s>
<s> let us then proceed <\s>
<s> by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army <\s>
<s> are to the same effect determining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged <\s>
<s> the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments <\s>
<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>
<s> should be delivered immediately to the portugueze government would the delivering up of them wipe away the affront <\s>
<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>

<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>
<s> it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their power yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away <\s>
<s> and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends <\s>
<s> the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms <\s>
<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>
<s> the nation required that the french should surrender at discretion grant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatience we were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender <\s>
<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>
<s> and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot <\s>
<s> had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other <\s>
<s> nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater <\s>
<s> yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners <\s>
<s> the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected <\s>
<s> a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary <\s>
<s> what was this but implying that it was dishonourable and that it would frustrate the efforts which his country was making and destroy the hopes which it had built upon its own power <\s>
<s> another letter from a magistrate inveighs against the convention as leaving the crimes of the french in portugal unpunished as giving no indemnification for all the murders robberies and atrocities which had been committed by them <\s>
<s> but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further <\s>
<s> i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all <\s>
<s> and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person <\s>
<s> if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one <\s>
<s> as to the fact it appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the person each has written down with his own hand i am the man <\s>
<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>
<s> men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed <\s>
<s> these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people <\s>
<s> it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actions from no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature <\s>
<s> let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalize and therefore degrade the human being he will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society <\s>
<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>

<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>
<s> a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our allies in asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given <\s>
<s> but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reason conciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commanding and repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind <\s>
<s> even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it <\s>
<s> we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life <\s>
<s> it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weakness if it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride <\s>
<s> the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong <\s>
<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>
<s> i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted <\s>
<s> there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the well intentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained <\s>
<s> therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those ill fated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that government to look for it if it were hidden to call it forth and by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights <\s>
<s> or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative <\s>
<s> in whatever circumstances portugal had been placed the paramount right of the portugueze nation or government to appear not merely as a party but a principal ought to have been established as a primary position without the admission of which all proposals to treat would be peremptorily rejected <\s>
<s> but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince <\s>
<s> well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation <\s>
<s> i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption <\s>
<s> nor would the evil be merely negative for the interference of professed friends acting in this manner must have superinduced dispositions and passions which were alien to the condition of the portugueze scattered weeds which could not have been found upon the soil if our ignorant hands had not sown them <\s>
<s> of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the threshold but i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted <\s>
<s> let us then proceed <\s>
<s> by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army <\s>
<s> are to the same effect determining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged <\s>
<s> the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments <\s>
<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>
<s> should be delivered immediately to the portugueze government would the delivering up of them wipe away the affront <\s>
<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>
<s> but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare <\s>
<s> or in a treaty of to day have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday <\s>
<s> eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both <\s>
<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>

<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>
<s> it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their power yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away <\s>
<s> and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends <\s>
<s> the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms <\s>
<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>
<s> the nation required that the french should surrender at discretion grant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatience we were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender <\s>
<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>
<s> and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot <\s>
<s> had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other <\s>
<s> nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater <\s>
<s> yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners <\s>
<s> the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected <\s>
<s> a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary <\s>
<s> what was this but implying that it was dishonourable and that it would frustrate the efforts which his country was making and destroy the hopes which it had built upon its own power <\s>
<s> another letter from a magistrate inveighs against the convention as leaving the crimes of the french in portugal unpunished as giving no indemnification for all the murders robberies and atrocities which had been committed by them <\s>
<s> but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further <\s>
<s> i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all <\s>
<s> and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person <\s>
<s> if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one <\s>
<s> as to the fact it appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the person each has written down with his own hand i am the man <\s>
<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>
<s> men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed <\s>
<s> these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people <\s>
<s> it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actions from no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature <\s>
<s> let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalize and therefore degrade the human being he will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society <\s>
<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>
<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>

<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>

<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>
<s> a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our allies in asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given <\s>
<s> but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reason conciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commanding and repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind <\s>
<s> even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it <\s>
<s> we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life <\s>
<s> it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weakness if it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride <\s>
<s> the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong <\s>
<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>
<s> i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted <\s>
<s> there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the well intentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained <\s>
<s> therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those ill fated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that government to look for it if it were hidden to call it forth and by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights <\s>
<s> or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative <\s>
<s> in whatever circumstances portugal had been placed the paramount right of the portugueze nation or government to appear not merely as a party but a principal ought to have been established as a primary position without the admission of which all proposals to treat would be peremptorily rejected <\s>
<s> but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince <\s>
<s> well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation <\s>
<s> i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption <\s>
<s> nor would the evil be merely negative for the interference of professed friends acting in this manner must have superinduced dispositions and passions which were alien to the condition of the portugueze scattered weeds which could not have been found upon the soil if our ignorant hands had not sown them <\s>
<s> of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the threshold but i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted <\s>
<s> let us then proceed <\s>
<s> by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army <\s>
<s> are to the same effect determining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged <\s>
<s> the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments <\s>
<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>
<s> should be delivered immediately to the portugueze government would the delivering up of them wipe away the affront <\s>
<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>
<s> but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare <\s>
<s> or in a treaty of to day have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday <\s>
<s> eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both <\s>
<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>

<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>

<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>
<s> and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot <\s>
<s> had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other <\s>
<s> nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater <\s>
<s> yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners <\s>
<s> the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected <\s>
<s> a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary <\s>
<s> what was this but implying that it was dishonourable and that it would frustrate the efforts which his country was making and destroy the hopes which it had built upon its own power <\s>
<s> another letter from a magistrate inveighs against the convention as leaving the crimes of the french in portugal unpunished as giving no indemnification for all the murders robberies and atrocities which had been committed by them <\s>
<s> but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further <\s>
<s> i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all <\s>
<s> and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person <\s>
<s> if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one <\s>
<s> as to the fact it appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the person each has written down with his own hand i am the man <\s>
<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>
<s> men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed <\s>
<s> these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people <\s>
<s> it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actions from no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature <\s>
<s> let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalize and therefore degrade the human being he will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society <\s>
<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>
<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>

<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>

<s> therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those ill fated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that government to look for it if it were hidden to call it forth and by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights <\s>
<s> or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative <\s>

<s> but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince <\s>
<s> well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation <\s>
<s> i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption <\s>
<s> nor would the evil be merely negative for the interference of professed friends acting in this manner must have superinduced dispositions and passions which were alien to the condition of the portugueze scattered weeds which could not have been found upon the soil if our ignorant hands had not sown them <\s>
<s> of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the threshold but i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted <\s>
<s> let us then proceed <\s>
<s> by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army <\s>
<s> are to the same effect determining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged <\s>
<s> the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments <\s>
<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>
<s> should be delivered immediately to the portugueze government would the delivering up of them wipe away the affront <\s>
<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>
<s> but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare <\s>
<s> or in a treaty of to day have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday <\s>
<s> eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both <\s>
<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>
<s> it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their power yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away <\s>
<s> and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends <\s>
<s> the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms <\s>
<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>
<s> the nation required that the french should surrender at discretion grant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatience we were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender <\s>
<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>

<s> but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further <\s>
<s> i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all <\s>
<s> and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person <\s>
<s> if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one <\s>
<s> as to the fact it appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the person each has written down with his own hand i am the man <\s>
<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>
<s> men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed <\s>
<s> these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people <\s>
<s> it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actions from no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature <\s>
<s> let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalize and therefore degrade the human being he will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society <\s>
<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>
<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>
<s> a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our allies in asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given <\s>
<s> but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reason conciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commanding and repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind <\s>
<s> even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it <\s>
<s> we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life <\s>
<s> it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weakness if it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride <\s>
<s> the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong <\s>
<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>
<s> i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted <\s>
<s> there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the well intentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained <\s>

<s> of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the threshold but i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted <\s>
<s> let us then proceed <\s>
<s> by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army <\s>
<s> are to the same effect determining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged <\s>
<s> the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments <\s>
<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>
<s> should be delivered immediately to the portugueze government would the delivering up of them wipe away the affront <\s>
<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>
<s> but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare <\s>
<s> or in a treaty of to day have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday <\s>
<s> eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both <\s>
<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>
<s> it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their power yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away <\s>
<s> and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends <\s>
<s> the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms <\s>
<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>
<s> the nation required that the french should surrender at discretion grant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatience we were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender <\s>
<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>
<s> and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot <\s>
<s> had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other <\s>
<s> nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater <\s>
<s> yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners <\s>
<s> the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected <\s>
<s> a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary <\s>

<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>
<s> men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed <\s>
<s> these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people <\s>
<s> it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actions from no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature <\s>
<s> let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalize and therefore degrade the human being he will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society <\s>
<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>
<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>
<s> a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our allies in asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given <\s>
<s> but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reason conciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commanding and repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind <\s>
<s> even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it <\s>
<s> we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life <\s>
<s> it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weakness if it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride <\s>
<s> the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong <\s>
<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>
<s> i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted <\s>
<s> there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the well intentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained <\s>
<s> therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those ill fated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that government to look for it if it were hidden to call it forth and by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights <\s>
<s> or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative <\s>
<s> in whatever circumstances portugal had been placed the paramount right of the portugueze nation or government to appear not merely as a party but a principal ought to have been established as a primary position without the admission of which all proposals to treat would be peremptorily rejected <\s>
<s> but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince <\s>
<s> well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation <\s>
<s> i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption <\s>

<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>

<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>
<s> but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare <\s>
<s> or in a treaty of to day have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday <\s>
<s> eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both <\s>
<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>
<s> it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their power yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away <\s>
<s> and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends <\s>
<s> the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms <\s>
<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>
<s> the nation required that the french should surrender at discretion grant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatience we were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender <\s>
<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>
<s> and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot <\s>
<s> had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other <\s>
<s> nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater <\s>
<s> yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners <\s>
<s> the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected <\s>
<s> a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary <\s>
<s> what was this but implying that it was dishonourable and that it would frustrate the efforts which his country was making and destroy the hopes which it had built upon its own power <\s>
<s> another letter from a magistrate inveighs against the convention as leaving the crimes of the french in portugal unpunished as giving no indemnification for all the murders robberies and atrocities which had been committed by them <\s>
<s> but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further <\s>
<s> i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all <\s>
<s> and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person <\s>
<s> if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one <\s>
<s> as to the fact it appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the person each has written down with his own hand i am the man <\s>
<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>

<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>
<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>
<s> a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our allies in asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given <\s>
<s> but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reason conciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commanding and repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind <\s>
<s> even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it <\s>
<s> we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life <\s>
<s> it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weakness if it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride <\s>
<s> the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong <\s>
<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>
<s> i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted <\s>
<s> there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the well intentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained <\s>
<s> therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those ill fated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that government to look for it if it were hidden to call it forth and by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights <\s>
<s> or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative <\s>
<s> in whatever circumstances portugal had been placed the paramount right of the portugueze nation or government to appear not merely as a party but a principal ought to have been established as a primary position without the admission of which all proposals to treat would be peremptorily rejected <\s>
<s> but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince <\s>
<s> well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation <\s>
<s> i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption <\s>
<s> nor would the evil be merely negative for the interference of professed friends acting in this manner must have superinduced dispositions and passions which were alien to the condition of the portugueze scattered weeds which could not have been found upon the soil if our ignorant hands had not sown them <\s>
<s> of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the threshold but i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted <\s>
<s> let us then proceed <\s>
<s> by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army <\s>
<s> are to the same effect determining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged <\s>
<s> the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments <\s>
<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>
<s> should be delivered immediately to the portugueze government would the delivering up of them wipe away the affront <\s>
<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>

<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>
<s> it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their power yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away <\s>
<s> and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends <\s>
<s> the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms <\s>
<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>
<s> the nation required that the french should surrender at discretion grant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatience we were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender <\s>
<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>
<s> and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot <\s>
<s> had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other <\s>
<s> nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater <\s>
<s> yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners <\s>
<s> the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected <\s>
<s> a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary <\s>
<s> what was this but implying that it was dishonourable and that it would frustrate the efforts which his country was making and destroy the hopes which it had built upon its own power <\s>
<s> another letter from a magistrate inveighs against the convention as leaving the crimes of the french in portugal unpunished as giving no indemnification for all the murders robberies and atrocities which had been committed by them <\s>
<s> but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further <\s>
<s> i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all <\s>
<s> and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person <\s>
<s> if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one <\s>
<s> as to the fact it appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the person each has written down with his own hand i am the man <\s>
<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>
<s> men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed <\s>
<s> these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people <\s>
<s> it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actions from no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature <\s>
<s> let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalize and therefore degrade the human being he will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society <\s>
<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>

<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>
<s> a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our allies in asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given <\s>
<s> but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reason conciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commanding and repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind <\s>
<s> even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it <\s>
<s> we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life <\s>
<s> it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weakness if it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride <\s>
<s> the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong <\s>
<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>
<s> i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted <\s>
<s> there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the well intentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained <\s>
<s> therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those ill fated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that government to look for it if it were hidden to call it forth and by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights <\s>
<s> or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative <\s>
<s> in whatever circumstances portugal had been placed the paramount right of the portugueze nation or government to appear not merely as a party but a principal ought to have been established as a primary position without the admission of which all proposals to treat would be peremptorily rejected <\s>
<s> but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince <\s>
<s> well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation <\s>
<s> i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption <\s>
<s> nor would the evil be merely negative for the interference of professed friends acting in this manner must have superinduced dispositions and passions which were alien to the condition of the portugueze scattered weeds which could not have been found upon the soil if our ignorant hands had not sown them <\s>
<s> of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the threshold but i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted <\s>
<s> let us then proceed <\s>
<s> by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army <\s>
<s> are to the same effect determining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged <\s>
<s> the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments <\s>
<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>
<s> should be delivered immediately to the portugueze government would the delivering up of them wipe away the affront <\s>
<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>
<s> but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare <\s>
<s> or in a treaty of to day have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday <\s>
<s> eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both <\s>
<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>

<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>
<s> it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their power yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away <\s>
<s> and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends <\s>
<s> the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms <\s>
<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>
<s> the nation required that the french should surrender at discretion grant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatience we were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender <\s>
<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>
<s> and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot <\s>
<s> had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other <\s>
<s> nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater <\s>
<s> yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners <\s>
<s> the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected <\s>
<s> a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary <\s>
<s> what was this but implying that it was dishonourable and that it would frustrate the efforts which his country was making and destroy the hopes which it had built upon its own power <\s>
<s> another letter from a magistrate inveighs against the convention as leaving the crimes of the french in portugal unpunished as giving no indemnification for all the murders robberies and atrocities which had been committed by them <\s>
<s> but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further <\s>
<s> i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all <\s>
<s> and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person <\s>
<s> if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one <\s>
<s> as to the fact it appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the person each has written down with his own hand i am the man <\s>
<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>
<s> men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed <\s>
<s> these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people <\s>
<s> it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actions from no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature <\s>
<s> let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalize and therefore degrade the human being he will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society <\s>
<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>
<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>

<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>

<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>
<s> a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our allies in asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given <\s>
<s> but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reason conciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commanding and repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind <\s>
<s> even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it <\s>
<s> we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life <\s>
<s> it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weakness if it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride <\s>
<s> the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong <\s>
<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>
<s> i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted <\s>
<s> there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the well intentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained <\s>
<s> therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those ill fated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that government to look for it if it were hidden to call it forth and by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights <\s>
<s> or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative <\s>
<s> in whatever circumstances portugal had been placed the paramount right of the portugueze nation or government to appear not merely as a party but a principal ought to have been established as a primary position without the admission of which all proposals to treat would be peremptorily rejected <\s>
<s> but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince <\s>
<s> well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation <\s>
<s> i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption <\s>
<s> nor would the evil be merely negative for the interference of professed friends acting in this manner must have superinduced dispositions and passions which were alien to the condition of the portugueze scattered weeds which could not have been found upon the soil if our ignorant hands had not sown them <\s>
<s> of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the threshold but i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted <\s>
<s> let us then proceed <\s>
<s> by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army <\s>
<s> are to the same effect determining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged <\s>
<s> the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments <\s>
<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>
<s> should be delivered immediately to the portugueze government would the delivering up of them wipe away the affront <\s>
<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>
<s> but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare <\s>
<s> or in a treaty of to day have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday <\s>
<s> eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both <\s>
<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>

<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>

<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>
<s> and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot <\s>
<s> had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other <\s>
<s> nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater <\s>
<s> yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners <\s>
<s> the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected <\s>
<s> a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary <\s>
<s> what was this but implying that it was dishonourable and that it would frustrate the efforts which his country was making and destroy the hopes which it had built upon its own power <\s>
<s> another letter from a magistrate inveighs against the convention as leaving the crimes of the french in portugal unpunished as giving no indemnification for all the murders robberies and atrocities which had been committed by them <\s>
<s> but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further <\s>
<s> i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all <\s>
<s> and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person <\s>
<s> if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one <\s>
<s> as to the fact it appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the person each has written down with his own hand i am the man <\s>
<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>
<s> men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed <\s>
<s> these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people <\s>
<s> it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actions from no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature <\s>
<s> let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalize and therefore degrade the human being he will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society <\s>
<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>
<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>

<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>

<s> therefore by the strongest obligations we were bound to be studious of a delicate and respectful bearing towards those ill fated nations our allies and consequently if the government of the portugueze though weak in power possessed their affections and was strong in right it was incumbent upon us to turn our first thoughts to that government to look for it if it were hidden to call it forth and by our power combined with that of the people to assert its rights <\s>
<s> or if the government were dissolved and had no existence it was our duty in such an emergency to have resorted to the nation expressing its will through the most respectable and conspicuous authority through that which seemed to have the best right to stand forth as its representative <\s>

<s> but the portugueze had a government they had a lawful prince in brazil and a regency appointed by him at home and generals at the head of considerable bodies of troops appointed also by the regency or the prince <\s>
<s> well then might one of those generals enter a formal protest against the treaty on account of its being totally void of that deference due to the prince regent or the government that represents him as being hostile to the sovereign authority and independence of that government and as being against the honour safety and independence of the nation <\s>
<s> i have already reminded the reader of the benign and happy influences which might have attended upon a different conduct how much good we might have added to that already in existence how far we might have assisted in strengthening among our allies those powers and in developing those virtues which were producing themselves by a natural process and to which these breathings of insult must have been a deadly check and interruption <\s>
<s> nor would the evil be merely negative for the interference of professed friends acting in this manner must have superinduced dispositions and passions which were alien to the condition of the portugueze scattered weeds which could not have been found upon the soil if our ignorant hands had not sown them <\s>
<s> of this i will not now speak for i have already detained the reader too long at the threshold but i have put the master key into his possession and every chamber which he opens will be found loathsome as the one which he last quitted <\s>
<s> let us then proceed <\s>
<s> by the first article of the convention it is covenanted that all the places and forts in the kingdom of portugal occupied by the french troops shall be delivered to the british army <\s>
<s> are to the same effect determining the surrender of portugueze fortified places stores and ships to the english forces but not a word of their being to be holden in trust for the prince regent or his government to whom they belonged <\s>
<s> the same neglect or contempt of justice and decency is shewn here as in the preamble to these instruments <\s>
<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>
<s> should be delivered immediately to the portugueze government would the delivering up of them wipe away the affront <\s>
<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>
<s> but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare <\s>
<s> or in a treaty of to day have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday <\s>
<s> eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both <\s>
<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>
<s> it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their power yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away <\s>
<s> and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends <\s>
<s> the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms <\s>
<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>
<s> the nation required that the french should surrender at discretion grant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatience we were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender <\s>
<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>

<s> it was further shewn afterwards by the act of hoisting the british flag instead of the portugueze upon these forts when they were first taken possession of by the british forces <\s>
<s> it is no excuse to say that this was not intended <\s>
<s> such inattentions are among the most grievous faults which can be committed and are impossible when the affections and understandings of men are of that quality and in that state which are required for a service in which there is any thing noble or virtuous <\s>
<s> again suppose that it was the purpose of the generals who signed and ratified a convention containing the articles in question that the forts and ships c <\s>

<s> would it not rather appear after the omission to recognize the right that we had ostentatiously taken upon us to bestow as a boon that which they felt to be their own <\s>
<s> passing by as already deliberated and decided upon those conditions articles ii <\s>
<s> and iii by which it is stipulated that the french army shall not be considered as prisoners of war shall be conveyed with arms c <\s>
<s> but have they on this account ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare <\s>
<s> or in a treaty of to day have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday <\s>
<s> eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator have they ever sacrificed the one to the other or in the blind effort lost both <\s>
<s> above all in their readiness to flourish with the pen have they ever overlooked the sword the symbol of their power and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory <\s>
<s> i notice this assumption of a double character on the part of the french not to lament over it and its consequences but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own generals and to explain how far men whom we have no reason to believe other than brave have through the influence of such example lost sight of their primary duties apeing instead of imitating and following only to be misled <\s>
<s> it is indeed deplorable that our generals from this infirmity or from any other cause did not assume that lofty deportment which the character and relative strength of the two armies authorized them and the nature of the service upon which they were sent enjoined them to assume that they were in such haste to treat that with such an enemy let me say at once and in such circumstances they should have treated at all <\s>
<s> is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was how he came into that country and what he had done there <\s>
<s> from the manifesto of the portugueze government issued at rio janeiro and from other official papers they might have learned what was notorious to all europe that this body of men commissioned by bonaparte in the time of profound peace without a declaration of war had invaded portugal under the command of junot who had perfidiously entered the country as the general of a friendly and allied power assuring the people as he advanced that he came to protect their sovereign against an invasion of the english and that when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom which offered no resistance and had expelled its lawful sovereign he wrung from it unheard of contributions ravaged it cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege and that when this unoffending people unable to endure any longer rose up against the tyrant he had given their towns and villages to the flames and put the whole country thus resisting under military execution setting aside all natural sympathy with the portugueze and spanish nations and all prudential considerations of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with it is plain that the french had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges or to those modes of intercourse which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war <\s>
<s> they were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers and the outward frame of an army <\s>
<s> during their occupation of portugal the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them but as a plea for some enormity to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country <\s>
<s> pillage sacrilege and murder sweeping murder and individual assassination had been proved against them by voices from every quarter <\s>
<s> they had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war and from every species of community acknowledged by reason <\s>
<s> but even should any one be so insensible as to question this he will not at all events deny that the french ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character <\s>
<s> for surely they never considered themselves merely as an army <\s>
<s> they had dissolved the established authorities of portugal and had usurped the civil power of the government and it was in this compound capacity under this twofold monstrous shape that they had exercised over the religion and property of the country the most grievous oppressions <\s>
<s> what then remained to protect them but their power right they had none and power <\s>
<s> it is a mortifying consideration but i will ask if bonaparte nor do i mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour had been in the place of sir hew dalrymple what would he have thought of their power yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away <\s>
<s> and this leads me from the contemplation of their errors in the estimate and application of means to the contemplation of their heavier errors and worse blindness in regard to ends <\s>
<s> the british generals acted as if they had no purpose but that the enemy should be removed from the country in which they were upon any terms <\s>
<s> now the evacuation of portugal was not the prime object but the manner in which that event was to be brought about this ought to have been deemed first both in order and importance the french were to be subdued their ferocious warfare and heinous policy to be confounded and in this way and no other was the deliverance of that country to be accomplished <\s>
<s> it was not for the soil or for the cities and forts that portugal was valued but for the human feeling which was there for the rights of human nature which might be there conspicuously asserted for a triumph over injustice and oppression there to be achieved which could neither be concealed nor disguised and which should penetrate the darkest corner of the dark continent of europe by its splendour <\s>
<s> we combated for victory in the empire of reason for strongholds in the imagination <\s>
<s> lisbon and portugal as city and soil were chiefly prized by us as a language but our generals mistook the counters of the game for the stake played for <\s>
<s> the nation required that the french should surrender at discretion grant that the victory of vimiera had excited some unreasonable impatience we were not so overweening as to demand that the enemy should surrender within a given time but that they should surrender <\s>
<s> every thing short of this was felt to be below the duties of the occasion not only no service but a grievous injury <\s>
<s> only as far as there was a prospect of forcing the enemy to an unconditional submission did the british nation deem that they had a right to interfere if that prospect failed they expected that their army would know that it became it to retire and take care of itself <\s>
<s> but our generals have told us that the convention would not have been admitted if they had not judged it right to effect even upon these terms the evacuation of portugal as ministerial to their future services in spain <\s>
<s> if this had been a common war between two established governments measuring with each other their regular resources there might have been some appearance of force in this plea <\s>
<s> but who does not cry out at once that the affections and opinions that is the souls of the people of spain and portugal must be the inspiration and the power if this labour is to be brought to a happy end <\s>
<s> therefore it was worse than folly to think of supporting spain by physical strength at the expence of moral <\s>
<s> besides she was strong in men she never earnestly solicited troops from us some of the provinces had even refused them when offered and all had been lukewarm in the acceptance of them <\s>
<s> the spaniards could not ultimately be benefited but by allies acting under the same impulses of honour roused by a sense of their wrongs and sharing their loves and hatreds above all their passion for justice <\s>
<s> they had themselves given an example at baylen proclaiming to all the world what ought to be aimed at by those who would uphold their cause and be associated in arms with them <\s>
<s> and was the law of justice which spaniards spanish peasantry i might almost say would not relax in favour of dupont to be relaxed by a british army in favour of junot <\s>
<s> had the french commander at lisbon or his army proved themselves less perfidious less cruel or less rapacious than the other <\s>
<s> nay did not the pride and crimes of junot call for humiliation and punishment far more importunately inasmuch as his power to do harm and therefore his will keeping pace with it had been greater <\s>
<s> yet in the noble letter of the governor of cadiz to dupont he expressly tells him that his conduct and that of his army had been such that they owed their lives only to that honour which forbad the spanish army to become executioners <\s>
<s> the portugueze also as appears from various letters produced before the board of inquiry have shewn to our generals as boldly as their respect for the british nation would permit them to do what they expected <\s>
<s> a portugueze general who was also a member of the regency appointed by the prince regent says in a protest addressed to sir hew dalrymple that he had been able to drive the french out of the provinces of algarve and alentejo and therefore he could not be convinced that such a convention was necessary <\s>
<s> what was this but implying that it was dishonourable and that it would frustrate the efforts which his country was making and destroy the hopes which it had built upon its own power <\s>
<s> another letter from a magistrate inveighs against the convention as leaving the crimes of the french in portugal unpunished as giving no indemnification for all the murders robberies and atrocities which had been committed by them <\s>
<s> but i feel that i shall be wanting in respect to my countrymen if i pursue this argument further <\s>
<s> i blush that it should be necessary to speak upon the subject at all <\s>
<s> and these are men and things which we have been reproved for condemning because evidence was wanting both as to fact and person <\s>
<s> if there ever was a case which could not in any rational sense of the word be prejudged this is one <\s>
<s> as to the fact it appears and sheds from its own body like the sun in heaven the light by which it is seen as to the person each has written down with his own hand i am the man <\s>
<s> condemnation of actions and men like these is not in the minds of a people thanks to the divine being and to human nature a matter of choice it is like a physical necessity as the hand must be burned which is thrust into the furnace the body chilled which stands naked in the freezing north wind <\s>
<s> i am entitled to make this assertion here when the moral depravity of the convention of which i shall have to speak hereafter has not even been touched upon <\s>
<s> nor let it be blamed in any man though his station be in private life that upon this occasion he speaks publicly and gives a decisive opinion concerning that part of this public event and those measures which are more especially military <\s>
<s> all have a right to speak and to make their voices heard as far as they have power <\s>
<s> for these are times in which the conduct of military men concerns us perhaps more intimately than that of any other class when the business of arms comes unhappily too near to the fire side when the character and duties of a soldier ought to be understood by every one who values his liberty and bears in mind how soon he may have to fight for it <\s>
<s> men will and ought to speak upon things in which they are so deeply interested how else are right notions to spread or is error to be destroyed <\s>
<s> these are times also in which if we may judge from the proceedings and result of the court of inquiry the heads of the army more than at any other period stand in need of being taught wisdom by the voice of the people <\s>
<s> it is their own interest both as men and as soldiers that the people should speak fervently and fearlessly of their actions from no other quarter can they be so powerfully reminded of the duties which they owe to themselves to their country and to human nature <\s>
<s> let any one read the evidence given before that court and he will there see how much the intellectual and moral constitution of many of our military officers has suffered by a profession which if not counteracted by admonitions willingly listened to and by habits of meditation does more than any other denaturalize and therefore degrade the human being he will note with sorrow how faint are their sympathies with the best feelings and how dim their apprehension of some of the most awful truths relating to the happiness and dignity of man in society <\s>
<s> but on this i do not mean to insist at present it is too weighty a subject to be treated incidentally and my purpose is not to invalidate the authority of military men positively considered upon a military question but comparatively to maintain that there are military transactions upon which the people have a right to be heard and upon which their authority is entitled to far more respect than any man or number of men can lay claim to who speak merely with the ordinary professional views of soldiership that there are such military transactions and that this is one of them <\s>
<s> the condemnation which the people of these islands pronounced upon the convention of cintra considered as to its main military results that is as a treaty by which it was established that the russian fleet should be surrendered on the terms specified and by which not only the obligation of forcing the french army to an unconditional surrender was abandoned but its restoration in freedom and triumph to its own country was secured the condemnation pronounced by the people upon a treaty by virtue of which these things were to be done i have recorded accounted for and thereby justified i will now proceed to another division of the subject on which i feel a still more earnest wish to speak because though in itself of the highest importance it has been comparatively neglected mean the political injustice and moral depravity which are stamped upon the front of this agreement and pervade every regulation which it contains <\s>
<s> i shall shew that our generals and with them our ministers as far as they might have either given directions to this effect or have countenanced what has been done when it was their paramount duty to maintain at all hazards the noblest principles in unsuspected integrity because upon the summons of these and in defence of them their allies had risen and by these alone could stand not only did not perform this duty but descended as far below the level of ordinary principles as they ought to have mounted above it imitating not the majesty of the oak with which it lifts its branches towards the heavens but the vigour with which in the language of the poet it strikes its roots downwards towards hell radice in tartara tendit <\s>
<s> the armistice is the basis of the convention and in the first article we find it agreed that there shall be a suspension of hostilities between the forces of his britannic majesty and those of his imperial and royal majesty napoleon i <\s>
<s> i will ask if it be the practice of military officers in instruments of this kind to acknowledge in the person of the head of the government with which they are at war titles which their own government for which they are acting has not acknowledged <\s>
<s> if this be the practice which i will not stop to determine it is grossly improper and ought to be abolished <\s>
<s> our generals however had entered portugal as allies of a government by which this title had been acknowledged and they might have pleaded this circumstance in mitigation of their offence but surely not in an instrument where we not only look in vain for the name of the portugueze sovereign or of the government which he appointed or of any heads or representatives of the portugueze armies or people as a party in the contract but where it is stipulated in the 4th article that the british general shall engage to include the portugueze armies in this convention <\s>
<s> what an outrage we enter the portugueze territory as allies and without their consent or even consulting them we proceed to form the basis of an agreement relating not to the safety or interests of our own army but to portugueze territory portugueze persons liberties and rights and engage out of our own will and power to include the portugueze army they or their government willing or not within the obligation of this agreement <\s>
<s> i place these things in contrast viz <\s>
<s> the acknowledgement of bonaparte as emperor and king and the utter neglect of the portugueze sovereign and portugueze authorities to shew in what spirit and temper these agreements were entered upon <\s>
<s> i will not here insist upon what was our duty on this occasion to the portugueze as dictated by those sublime precepts of justice which it has been proved that they and the spaniards had risen to defend and without feeling the force and sanctity of which they neither could have risen nor can oppose to their enemy resistance which has any hope in it but i will ask of any man who is not dead to the common feelings of his social nature and besotted in understanding if this be not a cruel mockery and which must have been felt unless it were repelled with hatred and scorn as a heart breaking insult <\s>
<s> moreover this conduct acknowledges by implication that principle which by his actions the enemy has for a long time covertly maintained and now openly and insolently avows in his words that power is the measure of right and it is in a steady adherence to this abominable doctrine that his strength mainly lies <\s>
<s> i do maintain then that as far as the conduct of our generals in framing these instruments tends to reconcile men to this course of action and to sanction this principle they are virtually his allies their weapons may be against him but he will laugh at their weapons for he knows though they themselves do not that their souls are for him <\s>
<s> look at the preamble to the armistice <\s>
<s> in what is omitted and what is inserted the french ruler could not have fashioned it more for his own purpose if he had traced it with his own hand <\s>
<s> we have then trampled upon a fundamental principle of justice and countenanced a prime maxim of iniquity thus adding in an unexampled degree the foolishness of impolicy to the heinousness of guilt <\s>
<s> a conduct thus grossly unjust and impolitic without having the hatred which it inspires neutralised by the contempt is made contemptible by utterly wanting that colour of right which authority and power put forth in defence of our allies in asserting their just claims and avenging their injuries might have given <\s>
<s> but we instead of triumphantly displaying our power towards our enemies have ostentatiously exercised it upon our friends reversing here as every where the practice of sense and reason conciliatory even to abject submission where we ought to have been haughty and commanding and repulsive and tyrannical where we ought to have been gracious and kind <\s>
<s> even a common law of good breeding would have served us here had we known how to apply it <\s>
<s> we ought to have endeavoured to raise the portugueze in their own estimation by concealing our power in comparison with theirs dealing with them in the spirit of those mild and humane delusions which spread such a genial grace over the intercourse and add so much to the influence of love in the concerns of private life <\s>
<s> it is a common saying presume that a man is dishonest and that is the readiest way to make him so in like manner it may be said presume that a nation is weak and that is the surest course to bring it to weakness if it be not rouzed to prove its strength by applying it to the humiliation of your pride <\s>
<s> the portugueze had been weak and in connection with their allies the spaniards they were prepared to become strong <\s>
<s> it was therefore doubly incumbent upon us to foster and encourage them to look favourably upon their efforts generously to give them credit upon their promises to hope with them and for them and thus anticipating and foreseeing we should by a natural operation of love have contributed to create the merits which were anticipated and foreseen <\s>
<s> i apply these rules taken from the intercourse between individuals to the conduct of large bodies of men or of nations towards each other because these are nothing but aggregates of individuals and because the maxims of all just law and the measures of all sane practice are only an enlarged or modified application of those dispositions of love and those principles of reason by which the welfare of individuals in their connection with each other is promoted <\s>
<s> there was also here a still more urgent call for these courteous and humane principles as guides of conduct because in exact proportion to the physical weakness of governments and to the distraction and confusion which cannot but prevail when a people is struggling for independence and liberty are the well intentioned and the wise among them remitted for their support to those benign elementary feelings of society for the preservation and cherishing of which among other important objects government was from the beginning ordained <\s>

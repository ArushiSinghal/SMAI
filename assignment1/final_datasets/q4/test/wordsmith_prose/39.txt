<s> the appointment i feel however imposes duties which far advanced in life as i am i cannot venture to undertake and therefore must beg leave to decline the acceptance of an offer that i shall always remember with no unbecoming pride <\s>
<s> her majesty will not i trust disapprove of a determination forced upon me by reflections which it is impossible for me to set aside <\s>

<s> had i been several years younger i should have accepted the office with pride and pleasure but on friday i shall enter god willing my 74th year and on account of so advanced an age i begged permission to decline it not venturing to undertake its duties <\s>
<s> for though as you are aware the formal task work of new year and birthday odes was abolished 194 when the appointment was given to mr <\s>
<s> southey he still considered himself obliged in conscience to produce and did produce verses some of very great merit upon important public occasions <\s>
<s> he failed to do so upon the queen's coronation and i know that this omission caused him no little uneasiness <\s>
<s> the same might happen to myself upon some important occasion and i should be uneasy under the possibility i hope therefore that neither you nor lord lonsdale nor any of my friends will blame me for what i have done <\s>
<s> 194 southey's account in his life and correspondence renders this statement questionable <\s>
<s> i was slow to send copies of grace darling about except to female friends lest i should seem to attach too much importance to the production though it was on a subject which interested the whole nation <\s>

<s> my dear sir i hope you may be induced to reconsider your decision with regard to the appointment of poet laureate <\s>

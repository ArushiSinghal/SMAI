<s> these were the particulars about three miles beyond keswick on the ambleside road is a small bridge from the top of which we got sight of the mail coach coming towards us at about forty yards distance just before the road begins to descend a narrow steep and winding slope <\s>
<s> nothing was left for j who drove the gig in which we were but to cross the bridge and as the road narrowed up the slope that was in our front to draw up as close to the wall on our left our side of the road as possible <\s>
<s> this he did both of us hoping that the coachman would slacken his pace down the hill and pass us as far from our wheel as the road would allow <\s>
<s> but he did neither <\s>
<s> on the contrary he drove furiously down the hill and though as we afterwards ascertained by the track of his wheels he had a yard width of road to spare he made no use of it <\s>
<s> in consequence of this recklessness and his want of skill the wheel of his coach struck our wheel most violently drove back our horse and gig some yards and then sent us all together through a small gap in the wall with the stones of the wall tumbling about us into a plantation that lay a yard perpendicular below the level of the road from which the horse and gig with us in it had been driven <\s>
<s> the shafts were broken off close to the carriage and we were partly thrown and partly leaped out <\s>
<s> after breaking the traces the horse leaped back into the road and galloped off the shafts and traces sticking to him nor did the poor creature stop till he reached the turnpike at grasmere seven miles from the spot where the mischief was done <\s>
<s> we sent by the coach for a chaise to take us to rydal and hired a cart to take the broken gig to be mended at keswick <\s>
<s> the mercy was that the violent shock from the coach did not tear off our wheel for if this had been done j and probably i also must have fallen under the hind wheels of the coach and in all likelihood been killed <\s>
<s> we have since learned that the coachman had only just come upon the road which is in a great many places very dangerous and that he was wholly unpractised in driving four in hand <\s>

<s> these were the particulars about three miles beyond keswick on the ambleside road is a small bridge from the top of which we got sight of the mail coach coming towards us at about forty yards distance just before the road begins to descend a narrow steep and winding slope <\s>
<s> nothing was left for j who drove the gig in which we were but to cross the bridge and as the road narrowed up the slope that was in our front to draw up as close to the wall on our left our side of the road as possible <\s>
<s> this he did both of us hoping that the coachman would slacken his pace down the hill and pass us as far from our wheel as the road would allow <\s>
<s> but he did neither <\s>
<s> on the contrary he drove furiously down the hill and though as we afterwards ascertained by the track of his wheels he had a yard width of road to spare he made no use of it <\s>
<s> in consequence of this recklessness and his want of skill the wheel of his coach struck our wheel most violently drove back our horse and gig some yards and then sent us all together through a small gap in the wall with the stones of the wall tumbling about us into a plantation that lay a yard perpendicular below the level of the road from which the horse and gig with us in it had been driven <\s>
<s> the shafts were broken off close to the carriage and we were partly thrown and partly leaped out <\s>
<s> after breaking the traces the horse leaped back into the road and galloped off the shafts and traces sticking to him nor did the poor creature stop till he reached the turnpike at grasmere seven miles from the spot where the mischief was done <\s>
<s> we sent by the coach for a chaise to take us to rydal and hired a cart to take the broken gig to be mended at keswick <\s>
<s> the mercy was that the violent shock from the coach did not tear off our wheel for if this had been done j and probably i also must have fallen under the hind wheels of the coach and in all likelihood been killed <\s>
<s> we have since learned that the coachman had only just come upon the road which is in a great many places very dangerous and that he was wholly unpractised in driving four in hand <\s>

<s> these were the particulars about three miles beyond keswick on the ambleside road is a small bridge from the top of which we got sight of the mail coach coming towards us at about forty yards distance just before the road begins to descend a narrow steep and winding slope <\s>
<s> nothing was left for j who drove the gig in which we were but to cross the bridge and as the road narrowed up the slope that was in our front to draw up as close to the wall on our left our side of the road as possible <\s>
<s> this he did both of us hoping that the coachman would slacken his pace down the hill and pass us as far from our wheel as the road would allow <\s>
<s> but he did neither <\s>
<s> on the contrary he drove furiously down the hill and though as we afterwards ascertained by the track of his wheels he had a yard width of road to spare he made no use of it <\s>
<s> in consequence of this recklessness and his want of skill the wheel of his coach struck our wheel most violently drove back our horse and gig some yards and then sent us all together through a small gap in the wall with the stones of the wall tumbling about us into a plantation that lay a yard perpendicular below the level of the road from which the horse and gig with us in it had been driven <\s>
<s> the shafts were broken off close to the carriage and we were partly thrown and partly leaped out <\s>
<s> after breaking the traces the horse leaped back into the road and galloped off the shafts and traces sticking to him nor did the poor creature stop till he reached the turnpike at grasmere seven miles from the spot where the mischief was done <\s>
<s> we sent by the coach for a chaise to take us to rydal and hired a cart to take the broken gig to be mended at keswick <\s>
<s> the mercy was that the violent shock from the coach did not tear off our wheel for if this had been done j and probably i also must have fallen under the hind wheels of the coach and in all likelihood been killed <\s>
<s> we have since learned that the coachman had only just come upon the road which is in a great many places very dangerous and that he was wholly unpractised in driving four in hand <\s>

<s> these were the particulars about three miles beyond keswick on the ambleside road is a small bridge from the top of which we got sight of the mail coach coming towards us at about forty yards distance just before the road begins to descend a narrow steep and winding slope <\s>
<s> nothing was left for j who drove the gig in which we were but to cross the bridge and as the road narrowed up the slope that was in our front to draw up as close to the wall on our left our side of the road as possible <\s>
<s> this he did both of us hoping that the coachman would slacken his pace down the hill and pass us as far from our wheel as the road would allow <\s>
<s> but he did neither <\s>
<s> on the contrary he drove furiously down the hill and though as we afterwards ascertained by the track of his wheels he had a yard width of road to spare he made no use of it <\s>
<s> in consequence of this recklessness and his want of skill the wheel of his coach struck our wheel most violently drove back our horse and gig some yards and then sent us all together through a small gap in the wall with the stones of the wall tumbling about us into a plantation that lay a yard perpendicular below the level of the road from which the horse and gig with us in it had been driven <\s>
<s> the shafts were broken off close to the carriage and we were partly thrown and partly leaped out <\s>
<s> after breaking the traces the horse leaped back into the road and galloped off the shafts and traces sticking to him nor did the poor creature stop till he reached the turnpike at grasmere seven miles from the spot where the mischief was done <\s>
<s> we sent by the coach for a chaise to take us to rydal and hired a cart to take the broken gig to be mended at keswick <\s>
<s> the mercy was that the violent shock from the coach did not tear off our wheel for if this had been done j and probably i also must have fallen under the hind wheels of the coach and in all likelihood been killed <\s>
<s> we have since learned that the coachman had only just come upon the road which is in a great many places very dangerous and that he was wholly unpractised in driving four in hand <\s>

<s> these were the particulars about three miles beyond keswick on the ambleside road is a small bridge from the top of which we got sight of the mail coach coming towards us at about forty yards distance just before the road begins to descend a narrow steep and winding slope <\s>
<s> nothing was left for j who drove the gig in which we were but to cross the bridge and as the road narrowed up the slope that was in our front to draw up as close to the wall on our left our side of the road as possible <\s>
<s> this he did both of us hoping that the coachman would slacken his pace down the hill and pass us as far from our wheel as the road would allow <\s>
<s> but he did neither <\s>
<s> on the contrary he drove furiously down the hill and though as we afterwards ascertained by the track of his wheels he had a yard width of road to spare he made no use of it <\s>
<s> in consequence of this recklessness and his want of skill the wheel of his coach struck our wheel most violently drove back our horse and gig some yards and then sent us all together through a small gap in the wall with the stones of the wall tumbling about us into a plantation that lay a yard perpendicular below the level of the road from which the horse and gig with us in it had been driven <\s>
<s> the shafts were broken off close to the carriage and we were partly thrown and partly leaped out <\s>
<s> after breaking the traces the horse leaped back into the road and galloped off the shafts and traces sticking to him nor did the poor creature stop till he reached the turnpike at grasmere seven miles from the spot where the mischief was done <\s>
<s> we sent by the coach for a chaise to take us to rydal and hired a cart to take the broken gig to be mended at keswick <\s>
<s> the mercy was that the violent shock from the coach did not tear off our wheel for if this had been done j and probably i also must have fallen under the hind wheels of the coach and in all likelihood been killed <\s>
<s> we have since learned that the coachman had only just come upon the road which is in a great many places very dangerous and that he was wholly unpractised in driving four in hand <\s>

<s> these were the particulars about three miles beyond keswick on the ambleside road is a small bridge from the top of which we got sight of the mail coach coming towards us at about forty yards distance just before the road begins to descend a narrow steep and winding slope <\s>
<s> nothing was left for j who drove the gig in which we were but to cross the bridge and as the road narrowed up the slope that was in our front to draw up as close to the wall on our left our side of the road as possible <\s>
<s> this he did both of us hoping that the coachman would slacken his pace down the hill and pass us as far from our wheel as the road would allow <\s>
<s> but he did neither <\s>
<s> on the contrary he drove furiously down the hill and though as we afterwards ascertained by the track of his wheels he had a yard width of road to spare he made no use of it <\s>
<s> in consequence of this recklessness and his want of skill the wheel of his coach struck our wheel most violently drove back our horse and gig some yards and then sent us all together through a small gap in the wall with the stones of the wall tumbling about us into a plantation that lay a yard perpendicular below the level of the road from which the horse and gig with us in it had been driven <\s>
<s> the shafts were broken off close to the carriage and we were partly thrown and partly leaped out <\s>
<s> after breaking the traces the horse leaped back into the road and galloped off the shafts and traces sticking to him nor did the poor creature stop till he reached the turnpike at grasmere seven miles from the spot where the mischief was done <\s>
<s> we sent by the coach for a chaise to take us to rydal and hired a cart to take the broken gig to be mended at keswick <\s>
<s> the mercy was that the violent shock from the coach did not tear off our wheel for if this had been done j and probably i also must have fallen under the hind wheels of the coach and in all likelihood been killed <\s>
<s> we have since learned that the coachman had only just come upon the road which is in a great many places very dangerous and that he was wholly unpractised in driving four in hand <\s>

<s> these were the particulars about three miles beyond keswick on the ambleside road is a small bridge from the top of which we got sight of the mail coach coming towards us at about forty yards distance just before the road begins to descend a narrow steep and winding slope <\s>
<s> nothing was left for j who drove the gig in which we were but to cross the bridge and as the road narrowed up the slope that was in our front to draw up as close to the wall on our left our side of the road as possible <\s>
<s> this he did both of us hoping that the coachman would slacken his pace down the hill and pass us as far from our wheel as the road would allow <\s>
<s> but he did neither <\s>
<s> on the contrary he drove furiously down the hill and though as we afterwards ascertained by the track of his wheels he had a yard width of road to spare he made no use of it <\s>
<s> in consequence of this recklessness and his want of skill the wheel of his coach struck our wheel most violently drove back our horse and gig some yards and then sent us all together through a small gap in the wall with the stones of the wall tumbling about us into a plantation that lay a yard perpendicular below the level of the road from which the horse and gig with us in it had been driven <\s>
<s> the shafts were broken off close to the carriage and we were partly thrown and partly leaped out <\s>
<s> after breaking the traces the horse leaped back into the road and galloped off the shafts and traces sticking to him nor did the poor creature stop till he reached the turnpike at grasmere seven miles from the spot where the mischief was done <\s>
<s> we sent by the coach for a chaise to take us to rydal and hired a cart to take the broken gig to be mended at keswick <\s>
<s> the mercy was that the violent shock from the coach did not tear off our wheel for if this had been done j and probably i also must have fallen under the hind wheels of the coach and in all likelihood been killed <\s>
<s> we have since learned that the coachman had only just come upon the road which is in a great many places very dangerous and that he was wholly unpractised in driving four in hand <\s>

<s> these were the particulars about three miles beyond keswick on the ambleside road is a small bridge from the top of which we got sight of the mail coach coming towards us at about forty yards distance just before the road begins to descend a narrow steep and winding slope <\s>
<s> nothing was left for j who drove the gig in which we were but to cross the bridge and as the road narrowed up the slope that was in our front to draw up as close to the wall on our left our side of the road as possible <\s>
<s> this he did both of us hoping that the coachman would slacken his pace down the hill and pass us as far from our wheel as the road would allow <\s>
<s> but he did neither <\s>
<s> on the contrary he drove furiously down the hill and though as we afterwards ascertained by the track of his wheels he had a yard width of road to spare he made no use of it <\s>
<s> in consequence of this recklessness and his want of skill the wheel of his coach struck our wheel most violently drove back our horse and gig some yards and then sent us all together through a small gap in the wall with the stones of the wall tumbling about us into a plantation that lay a yard perpendicular below the level of the road from which the horse and gig with us in it had been driven <\s>
<s> the shafts were broken off close to the carriage and we were partly thrown and partly leaped out <\s>
<s> after breaking the traces the horse leaped back into the road and galloped off the shafts and traces sticking to him nor did the poor creature stop till he reached the turnpike at grasmere seven miles from the spot where the mischief was done <\s>
<s> we sent by the coach for a chaise to take us to rydal and hired a cart to take the broken gig to be mended at keswick <\s>
<s> the mercy was that the violent shock from the coach did not tear off our wheel for if this had been done j and probably i also must have fallen under the hind wheels of the coach and in all likelihood been killed <\s>
<s> we have since learned that the coachman had only just come upon the road which is in a great many places very dangerous and that he was wholly unpractised in driving four in hand <\s>

<s> these were the particulars about three miles beyond keswick on the ambleside road is a small bridge from the top of which we got sight of the mail coach coming towards us at about forty yards distance just before the road begins to descend a narrow steep and winding slope <\s>
<s> nothing was left for j who drove the gig in which we were but to cross the bridge and as the road narrowed up the slope that was in our front to draw up as close to the wall on our left our side of the road as possible <\s>
<s> this he did both of us hoping that the coachman would slacken his pace down the hill and pass us as far from our wheel as the road would allow <\s>
<s> but he did neither <\s>
<s> on the contrary he drove furiously down the hill and though as we afterwards ascertained by the track of his wheels he had a yard width of road to spare he made no use of it <\s>
<s> in consequence of this recklessness and his want of skill the wheel of his coach struck our wheel most violently drove back our horse and gig some yards and then sent us all together through a small gap in the wall with the stones of the wall tumbling about us into a plantation that lay a yard perpendicular below the level of the road from which the horse and gig with us in it had been driven <\s>
<s> the shafts were broken off close to the carriage and we were partly thrown and partly leaped out <\s>
<s> after breaking the traces the horse leaped back into the road and galloped off the shafts and traces sticking to him nor did the poor creature stop till he reached the turnpike at grasmere seven miles from the spot where the mischief was done <\s>
<s> we sent by the coach for a chaise to take us to rydal and hired a cart to take the broken gig to be mended at keswick <\s>
<s> the mercy was that the violent shock from the coach did not tear off our wheel for if this had been done j and probably i also must have fallen under the hind wheels of the coach and in all likelihood been killed <\s>
<s> we have since learned that the coachman had only just come upon the road which is in a great many places very dangerous and that he was wholly unpractised in driving four in hand <\s>

<s> in the course of it he expressed to me the feelings of reverence which prevented him from venturing to lay his hand on what he always thought a subject too high for him and he accompanied this with the earnest protest that his works as well as those of any other poet should not be considered as developing all the influences which his own heart recognised but rather those which he considered himself able as an artist to display to advantage and which he thought most applicable to the wants and admitted by the usages of the world at large <\s>
<s> this was followed by a most interesting discussion upon milton cowper the general progress of religion as an element of poetry and the gradual steps by which it must advance to a power comprehensive and universally admitted steps which are defined in their order by the constitution of the human mind and which must proceed with vastly more slowness in the case of the progress made by collective minds than it does in an individual soul 172 114 <\s>

<s> i hope dear lady frederick that nothing will prevent my appearance at lowther towards the end of next week <\s>
<s> but i have for these last few years been visited always with a serious inflammation in my eyes about this season of the year which causes me to have fears about the fulfilment of any engagement however agreeable <\s>
<s> pray thank lord lonsdale on my part for his thinking of me upon this occasion <\s>
<s> on monday morning a little before nine a beautiful and bright day the queen dowager and her sister appeared at rydal <\s>
<s> i met them at the lower waterfall with which her majesty seemed much pleased <\s>
<s> upon hearing that it was not more than half a mile to the higher fall she said briskly she would go though lord denbigh and lord howe felt that they were pressed for time having to go upon keswick lake and thence to paterdale <\s>
<s> i walked by the queen's side up to the higher waterfall and she seemed to be struck much with the beauty of the scenery <\s>
<s> her step was exceedingly light but i learned that her health is not good or rather that she still suffers from the state of her constitution which caused her to go abroad <\s>
<s> upon quitting the park of rydal nearly opposite our own gate the queen was saluted with a pretty rural spectacle nearly fifty children drawn up in avenue with bright garlands in their hands three large flags flying and a band of music <\s>
<s> they had come from ambleside and the garlands were such as are annually prepared at this season for a ceremony called the rush bearing and the parish clerk of ambleside hit upon this way of showing at rydal the same respect to the queen which had been previously shown at ambleside <\s>
<s> i led the queen to the principal points of view in our little domain particularly to that through the summer house which shows the lake of rydal to such advantage <\s>
<s> the queen talked more than once about having a cottage among the lakes which of course was nothing more than a natural way of giving vent to the pleasure which she had in the country <\s>
<s> you will think i fear that i have dwelt already too long upon the subject and i shall therefore only add that all went off satisfactorily and that every one was delighted with her majesty's demeanour <\s>
<s> lord and lady sheffield were the only persons of her suite whom i had seen before <\s>
<s> lord howe was pleased with the sight of the pictures from his friend sir george beaumont's pencil and showed them to the queen who having sat some little time in the house took her leave cordially shaking mrs <\s>
<s> wordsworth by the hand as a friend of her own rank might have done <\s>
<s> she had also inquired for dora who was introduced to her <\s>
<s> i hope she will come again into the country and visit lowther <\s>
<s> pray excuse the above long story which i should not have ventured upon but that you expressed a wish upon the subject <\s>
<s> i hope and do not doubt that you all enjoy it my dear lady frederick as we are doing <\s>
<s> i ought not to forget that two days ago i went over to see mr <\s>
<s> southey or rather mrs <\s>
<s> southey for he is past taking pleasure in the presence of any of his friends <\s>
<s> he did not recognise me till he was told <\s>
<s> then his eyes flashed for a moment with their former brightness but he sank into the state in which i had found him patting with both hands his books affectionately like a child <\s>

<s> but ours is not an age of this character and after having seen such a long series of misconduct so many unjustifiable attempts made and sometimes carried into effect good endeavours frustrated disinterested wishes thwarted and benevolent hopes disappointed it is reasonable that we should endeavour to ascertain to what cause these evils are to be ascribed <\s>
<s> i have directed the attention of the reader to one primary cause and can he doubt of its existence and of the operation which i have attributed to it <\s>
<s> in the course of the last thirty years we have seen two wars waged against liberty the american war and the war against the french people in the early stages of their revolution <\s>
<s> in the latter instance the emigrants and the continental powers and the british did in all their expectations and in every movement of their efforts manifest a common ignorance originating in the same source <\s>
<s> and for what more especially belongs to ourselves at this time we may affirm that the same presumptuous irreverence of the principles of justice and blank insensibility to the affections of human nature which determined the conduct of our government in those two wars against liberty have continued to accompany its exertions in the present struggle for liberty and have rendered them fruitless <\s>
<s> the british government deems no doubt on its own part that its intentions are good <\s>
<s> it must not deceive itself nor must we deceive ourselves <\s>
<s> intentions thoroughly good could not mingle with the unblessed actions which we have witnessed <\s>
<s> a disinterested and pure intention is a light that guides as well as cheers and renders desperate lapses impossible <\s>
<s> our duty is our aim ought to be to employ the true means of liberty and virtue for the ends of liberty and virtue <\s>
<s> in such policy thoroughly understood there is fitness and concord and rational subordination it deserves a higher name organization health and grandeur <\s>
<s> contrast in a single instance the two processes and the qualifications which they require <\s>
<s> the ministers of that period found it an easy task to hire a band of hessians and to send it across the atlantic that they might assist in bringing the americans according to the phrase then prevalent to reason <\s>
<s> the force with which these troops would attack was gross tangible and might be calculated but the spirit of resistance which their presence would create was subtle ethereal mighty and incalculable <\s>
<s> accordingly from the moment when these foreigners landed men who had no interest no business in the quarrel but what the wages of their master bound him to and he imposed upon his miserable slaves nay from the first rumour of their destination the success of the british was as hath since been affirmed by judicious americans impossible <\s>
<s> the british government of the present day have been seduced as we have seen by the same commonplace facilities on the one side and have been equally blind on the other <\s>
<s> a physical auxiliar force of thirty five thousand men is to be added to the army of spain but the moral energy which thereby might be taken away from the principal is overlooked or slighted the material being too fine for their calculation <\s>
<s> what does it avail to graft a bough upon a tree if this be done so ignorantly and rashly that the trunk which can alone supply the sap by which the whole must flourish receives a deadly wound <\s>
<s> palpable effects of the convention of cintra and self contradicting consequences even in the matter especially aimed at may be seen in the necessity which it entailed of leaving 8,000 british troops to protect portugueze traitors from punishment by the laws of their country <\s>
<s> a still more serious and fatal contradiction lies in this that the english army was made an instrument of injustice and was dishonoured in order that it might be hurried forward to uphold a cause which could have no life but by justice and honour <\s>
<s> the nation knows how that army languished in the heart of spain that it accomplished nothing except its retreat is sure what great service it might have performed if it had moved from a different impulse we have shewn <\s>
<s> it surely then behoves those who are in authority to look to the state of their own minds <\s>
<s> there is indeed an inherent impossibility that they should be equal to the arduous duties which have devolved upon them but it is not unreasonable to hope that something higher might be aimed at and that the people might see upon great occasions in the practice of its rulers a more adequate reflection of its own wisdom and virtue <\s>
<s> our rulers i repeat must begin with their own minds <\s>
<s> this is a precept of immediate urgency and if attended to might be productive of immediate good <\s>
<s> i will follow it with further conclusions directly referring to future conduct <\s>
<s> i will not suppose that any ministry of this country can be so abject so insensible and unwise as to abandon the spaniards and portugueze while there is a patriot in arms or if the people should for a time be subjugated to deny them assistance the moment they rise to require it again <\s>
<s> i cannot think so unfavourably of my country as to suppose this possible <\s>
<s> let men in power however take care and let the nation be equally careful not to receive any reports from our army of the disposition of the spanish people without mistrust <\s>
<s> the british generals who were in portugal the whole body of them 21 according to the statement of sir hew dalrymple approved of the convention of cintra and have thereby shewn that their communications are not to be relied upon in this case <\s>
<s> and indeed there is not any information which we can receive upon this subject that is so little trustworthy as that which comes from our army or from any part of it <\s>
<s> the opportunities of notice afforded to soldiers in actual service must necessarily be very limited and a thousand things stand in the way of their power to make a right use of these <\s>
<s> but a retreating army in the country of an ally harrassed and dissatisfied willing to find a reason for its failures in any thing but itself and actually not without much solid ground for complaint retreating sometimes perhaps fugitive and in its disorder tempted and even forced to commit offences upon the people of the district through which it passes while they in their turn are filled with fear and inconsiderate anger an army in such a condition must needs be incapable of seeing objects as they really are and at the same time all things must change in its presence and put on their most unfavourable appearances <\s>
<s> 21 from this number however must be excepted the gallant and patriotic general ferguson <\s>
<s> for that officer has had the virtue publicly and in the most emphatic manner upon two occasions to reprobate the whole transaction <\s>
<s> deeming it then not to be doubted that the british government will continue its endeavours to support its allies one or other of two maxims of policy follows obviously from the painful truths which we have been considering either first that we should put forth to the utmost our strength as a military power strain it to the very last point and prepare no erect mind will start at the proposition to pour into the peninsula a force of two hundred thousand men or more and make ourselves for a time upon spanish ground principals in the contest or secondly that we should direct our attention to giving support rather in things than in men <\s>
<s> the former plan though requiring a great effort and many sacrifices is i have no doubt practicable its difficulties would yield to a bold and energetic ministry in despite of the present constitution of parliament <\s>
<s> the militia if they had been called upon at the beginning of the rising in the peninsula would i believe almost to a man have offered their services so would many of the volunteers in their individual capacity <\s>
<s> they would do so still <\s>
<s> the advantages of this plan would be that the power which would attend it must if judiciously directed insure unity of effort taming down by its dignity the discords which usually prevail among allied armies and subordinating to itself the affections of the spanish and portugueze by the palpable service which it was rendering to their country <\s>
<s> a further encouragement for adopting this plan he will find who perceives that the military power of our enemy is not in substance so formidable by many many degrees of terror as outwardly it appears to be <\s>
<s> the last campaign has not been wholly without advantage since it has proved that the french troops are indebted for their victories to the imbecility of their opponents far more than to their own discipline or courage or even to the skill and talents of their generals <\s>
<s> there is a superstition hanging over us which the efforts of our army not to speak of the spaniards have i hope removed but their mighty numbers in that is a delusion of another kind <\s>
<s> accordingly they are disregarded in some instances and sink insensibly into neglect with the general improvement of society <\s>
<s> but they often survive when they have become an oppression and a hindrance which cannot be cast off decisively but by an impulse rising either from the absolute knowledge of good and great men or from the partial insight which is given to superior minds though of a vitiated moral constitution or lastly from that blind energy and those habits of daring which are often found in men who checked by no restraint of morality suffer their evil passions to gain extraordinary strength in extraordinary circumstances <\s>

<s> a further encouragement for adopting this plan he will find who perceives that the military power of our enemy is not in substance so formidable by many many degrees of terror as outwardly it appears to be <\s>
<s> the last campaign has not been wholly without advantage since it has proved that the french troops are indebted for their victories to the imbecility of their opponents far more than to their own discipline or courage or even to the skill and talents of their generals <\s>

<s> accordingly they are disregarded in some instances and sink insensibly into neglect with the general improvement of society <\s>
<s> but they often survive when they have become an oppression and a hindrance which cannot be cast off decisively but by an impulse rising either from the absolute knowledge of good and great men or from the partial insight which is given to superior minds though of a vitiated moral constitution or lastly from that blind energy and those habits of daring which are often found in men who checked by no restraint of morality suffer their evil passions to gain extraordinary strength in extraordinary circumstances <\s>
<s> by any of these forces may the tyranny be broken through <\s>

<s> i wish then that we could so far imitate our enemies as like them to shake off these bonds but not like them from the worst but from the worthiest impulse <\s>

<s> there is a kindliness as they feel in the nature of advancement and prosperity is their genius <\s>

<s> it is the fallen spirit triumphant in misdeeds which was formerly a blessed angel <\s>
<s> if then to return to ourselves there be such strong obstacles in the way of our drawing benefit either from the maxims of policy or the principles of justice what hope remains that the british nation should repair by its future conduct the injury which has been done we cannot advance a step towards a rational answer to this question without previously adverting to the original sources of our miscarriages which are these first a want in the minds of the members of government and public functionaries of knowledge indispensible for this service and secondly a want of power in the same persons acting in their corporate capacities to give effect to the knowledge which individually they possess of the latter source of weakness this inability as caused by decay in the machine of government and by illegitimate forces which are checking and controuling its constitutional motions i have not spoken nor shall i now speak for i have judged it best to suspend my task for a while and this subject being in its nature delicate ought not to be lightly or transiently touched <\s>
<s> besides no immediate effect can be expected from the soundest and most unexceptionable doctrines which might be laid down for the correcting of this evil the former source of weakness namely the want of appropriate and indispensible knowledge has in the past investigation been reached and shall be further laid open not without a hope of some result of immediate good by a direct application to the mind and in full confidence that the best and surest way to render operative that knowledge which is already possessed is to increase the stock of knowledge <\s>
<s> here let me avow that i undertook this present labour as a serious duty rather that it was forced and has been unremittingly pressed upon me by a perception of justice united with strength of feeling in a word by that power of conscience calm or impassioned to which throughout i have done reverence as the animating spirit of the cause <\s>
<s> my work was begun and prosecuted under this controul and with the accompanying satisfaction that no charge of presumption could by a thinking mind be brought against me though i had taken upon myself to offer instruction to men who if they possess not talents and acquirements have no title to the high stations which they hold who also by holding those stations are understood to obtain certain benefit of experience and of knowledge not otherwise to be gained and who have a further claim to deference founded upon reputation even when it is spurious as much of the reputation of men high in power must necessarily be their errors being veiled and palliated by the authority attached to their office while that same authority gives more than due weight and effect to their wiser opinions <\s>
<s> yet notwithstanding all this i did not fear the censure of having unbecomingly obtruded counsels or remonstrances <\s>
<s> for there can be no presumption upon a call so affecting as the present in an attempt to assert the sanctity and to display the efficacy of principles and passions which are the natural birth right of man to some share of which all are born but an inheritance which may be alienated or consumed and by none more readily and assuredly than by those who are most eager for the praise of policy of prudence of sagacity and of all those qualities which are the darling virtues of the worldly wise <\s>
<s> moreover the evidence to which i have made appeal in order to establish the truth is not locked up in cabinets but is accessible to all as it exists in the bosoms of men in the appearances and intercourse of daily life in the details of passing events and in general history <\s>
<s> and more especially is its right import within the reach of him who taking no part in public measures and having no concern in the changes of things but as they affect what is most precious in his country and humanity will doubtless be more alive to those genuine sensations which are the materials of sound judgment <\s>
<s> nor is it to be overlooked that such a man may have more leisure and probably will have a stronger inclination to communicate with the records of past ages <\s>
<s> deeming myself justified then in what has been said i will continue to lay open and in some degree to account for those privations in the materials of judgment and those delusions of opinion and infirmities of mind to which practical statesmen and particularly such as are high in office are more than other men subject as containing an answer to that question so interesting at this juncture how far is it in our power to make amends for the harm done <\s>
<s> after the view of things which has been taken we may confidently affirm that nothing but a knowledge of human nature directing the operations of our government can give it a right to an intimate association with a cause which is that of human nature <\s>
<s> i say an intimate association founded on the right of thorough knowledge to contradistinguish this best mode of exertion from another which might found its right upon a vast and commanding military power put forth with manifestation of sincere intentions to benefit our allies from a conviction merely of policy that their liberty independence and honour are our genuine gain to distinguish the pure brotherly connection from this other in its appearance at least more magisterial which such a power guided by such intention uniformly displayed might authorize <\s>
<s> but of the former connection which supposes the main military effort to be made even at present by the people of the peninsula on whom the moral interest more closely presses and of the knowledge which it demands i have hitherto spoken and have further to speak <\s>
<s> it is plain ?priori that the minds of statesmen and courtiers are unfavourable to the growth of this knowledge <\s>
<s> for they are in a situation exclusive and artificial which has the further disadvantage that it does not separate men from men by collateral partitions which leave along with difference a sense of equality that they who are divided are yet upon the same level but by a degree of superiority which can scarcely fail to be accompanied with more or less of pride <\s>
<s> this situation therefore must be eminently unfavourable for the reception and establishment of that knowledge which is founded not upon things but upon sensations sensations which are general and under general influences and this it is which makes them what they are and gives them their importance ); not upon things which may be brought but upon sensations which must be met <\s>
<s> passing by the kindred and usually accompanying influence of birth in a certain rank and where education has been pre defined from childhood for the express purpose of future political power the tendency of such education to warp and therefore weaken the intellect we may join at once with the privation which i have been noticing a delusion equally common <\s>
<s> it is this that practical statesmen assume too much credit to themselves for their ability to see into the motives and manage the selfish passions of their immediate agents and dependants and for the skill with which they baffle or resist the aims of their opponents <\s>
<s> a promptness in looking through the most superficial part of the characters of those men who by the very circumstance of their contending ambitiously for the rewards and honours of government are separated from the mass of the society to which they belong is mistaken for a knowledge of human kind <\s>
<s> hence where higher knowledge is a prime requisite they not only are unfurnished but being unconscious that they are so they look down contemptuously upon those who endeavour to supply in some degree their want the instincts of natural and social man the deeper emotions the simpler feelings the spacious range of the disinterested imagination the pride in country for country's sake when to serve has not been a formal profession and the mind is therefore left in a state of dignity only to be surpassed by having served nobly and generously the instantaneous accomplishment in which they start up who upon a searching call stir for the land which they love not from personal motives but for a reward which is undefined and cannot be missed the solemn fraternity which a great nation composes gathered together in a stormy season under the shade of ancestral feeling the delicacy of moral honour which pervades the minds of a people when despair has been suddenly thrown off and expectations are lofty the apprehensiveness to a touch unkindly or irreverent where sympathy is at once exacted as a tribute and welcomed as a gift the power of injustice and inordinate calamity to transmute to invigorate and to govern to sweep away the barriers of opinion to reduce under submission passions purely evil to exalt the nature of indifferent qualities and to render them fit companions for the absolute virtues with which they are summoned to associate to consecrate passions which if not bad in themselves are of such temper that in the calm of ordinary life they are rightly deemed so to correct and embody these passions and without weakening them nay with tenfold addition to their strength to make them worthy of taking their place as the advanced guard of hope when a sublime movement of deliverance is to be originated these arrangements and resources of nature these ways and means of society have so little connection with those others upon which a ruling minister of a long established government is accustomed to depend these elements as it were of a universe functions of a living body are so opposite in their mode of action to the formal machine which it has been his pride to manage that he has but a faint perception of their immediate efficacy knows not the facility with which they assimilate with other powers nor the property by which such of them as from necessity of nature must change or pass away will under wise and fearless management surely generate lawful successors to fill their place when their appropriate work is performed <\s>
<s> nay of the majority of men who are usually found in high stations under old governments it may without injustice be said that when they look about them in times alas <\s>
<s> too rare which present the glorious product of such agency to their eyes they have not a right to say with a dejected man in the midst of the woods the rivers the mountains the sunshine and shadows of some transcendant landscape i see not feel how beautiful they are these spectators neither see nor feel <\s>

<s> but whatever may be the cause the fact is certain that there is an unconquerable tendency in all power save that of knowledge acting by and through knowledge to injure the mind of him who exercises that power so much so that best natures cannot escape the evil of such alliance <\s>

<s> to prevent misconception and to silence at least to throw discredit upon the clamours of ignorance i have thought proper thus in some sort to strike a balance between the claims of men of routine and men of original and accomplished minds to the management of state affairs in ordinary circumstances <\s>
<s> but ours is not an age of this character and after having seen such a long series of misconduct so many unjustifiable attempts made and sometimes carried into effect good endeavours frustrated disinterested wishes thwarted and benevolent hopes disappointed it is reasonable that we should endeavour to ascertain to what cause these evils are to be ascribed <\s>
<s> i have directed the attention of the reader to one primary cause and can he doubt of its existence and of the operation which i have attributed to it <\s>
<s> in the course of the last thirty years we have seen two wars waged against liberty the american war and the war against the french people in the early stages of their revolution <\s>
<s> in the latter instance the emigrants and the continental powers and the british did in all their expectations and in every movement of their efforts manifest a common ignorance originating in the same source <\s>
<s> and for what more especially belongs to ourselves at this time we may affirm that the same presumptuous irreverence of the principles of justice and blank insensibility to the affections of human nature which determined the conduct of our government in those two wars against liberty have continued to accompany its exertions in the present struggle for liberty and have rendered them fruitless <\s>
<s> the british government deems no doubt on its own part that its intentions are good <\s>
<s> it must not deceive itself nor must we deceive ourselves <\s>
<s> intentions thoroughly good could not mingle with the unblessed actions which we have witnessed <\s>
<s> a disinterested and pure intention is a light that guides as well as cheers and renders desperate lapses impossible <\s>
<s> our duty is our aim ought to be to employ the true means of liberty and virtue for the ends of liberty and virtue <\s>
<s> in such policy thoroughly understood there is fitness and concord and rational subordination it deserves a higher name organization health and grandeur <\s>
<s> contrast in a single instance the two processes and the qualifications which they require <\s>
<s> the ministers of that period found it an easy task to hire a band of hessians and to send it across the atlantic that they might assist in bringing the americans according to the phrase then prevalent to reason <\s>
<s> the force with which these troops would attack was gross tangible and might be calculated but the spirit of resistance which their presence would create was subtle ethereal mighty and incalculable <\s>
<s> accordingly from the moment when these foreigners landed men who had no interest no business in the quarrel but what the wages of their master bound him to and he imposed upon his miserable slaves nay from the first rumour of their destination the success of the british was as hath since been affirmed by judicious americans impossible <\s>
<s> the british government of the present day have been seduced as we have seen by the same commonplace facilities on the one side and have been equally blind on the other <\s>
<s> a physical auxiliar force of thirty five thousand men is to be added to the army of spain but the moral energy which thereby might be taken away from the principal is overlooked or slighted the material being too fine for their calculation <\s>
<s> what does it avail to graft a bough upon a tree if this be done so ignorantly and rashly that the trunk which can alone supply the sap by which the whole must flourish receives a deadly wound <\s>
<s> palpable effects of the convention of cintra and self contradicting consequences even in the matter especially aimed at may be seen in the necessity which it entailed of leaving 8,000 british troops to protect portugueze traitors from punishment by the laws of their country <\s>
<s> a still more serious and fatal contradiction lies in this that the english army was made an instrument of injustice and was dishonoured in order that it might be hurried forward to uphold a cause which could have no life but by justice and honour <\s>
<s> the nation knows how that army languished in the heart of spain that it accomplished nothing except its retreat is sure what great service it might have performed if it had moved from a different impulse we have shewn <\s>
<s> it surely then behoves those who are in authority to look to the state of their own minds <\s>
<s> there is indeed an inherent impossibility that they should be equal to the arduous duties which have devolved upon them but it is not unreasonable to hope that something higher might be aimed at and that the people might see upon great occasions in the practice of its rulers a more adequate reflection of its own wisdom and virtue <\s>
<s> our rulers i repeat must begin with their own minds <\s>
<s> this is a precept of immediate urgency and if attended to might be productive of immediate good <\s>
<s> i will follow it with further conclusions directly referring to future conduct <\s>
<s> i will not suppose that any ministry of this country can be so abject so insensible and unwise as to abandon the spaniards and portugueze while there is a patriot in arms or if the people should for a time be subjugated to deny them assistance the moment they rise to require it again <\s>
<s> i cannot think so unfavourably of my country as to suppose this possible <\s>
<s> let men in power however take care and let the nation be equally careful not to receive any reports from our army of the disposition of the spanish people without mistrust <\s>
<s> the british generals who were in portugal the whole body of them 21 according to the statement of sir hew dalrymple approved of the convention of cintra and have thereby shewn that their communications are not to be relied upon in this case <\s>
<s> and indeed there is not any information which we can receive upon this subject that is so little trustworthy as that which comes from our army or from any part of it <\s>
<s> the opportunities of notice afforded to soldiers in actual service must necessarily be very limited and a thousand things stand in the way of their power to make a right use of these <\s>
<s> but a retreating army in the country of an ally harrassed and dissatisfied willing to find a reason for its failures in any thing but itself and actually not without much solid ground for complaint retreating sometimes perhaps fugitive and in its disorder tempted and even forced to commit offences upon the people of the district through which it passes while they in their turn are filled with fear and inconsiderate anger an army in such a condition must needs be incapable of seeing objects as they really are and at the same time all things must change in its presence and put on their most unfavourable appearances <\s>
<s> 21 from this number however must be excepted the gallant and patriotic general ferguson <\s>

<s> a still more serious and fatal contradiction lies in this that the english army was made an instrument of injustice and was dishonoured in order that it might be hurried forward to uphold a cause which could have no life but by justice and honour <\s>

<s> there is indeed an inherent impossibility that they should be equal to the arduous duties which have devolved upon them but it is not unreasonable to hope that something higher might be aimed at and that the people might see upon great occasions in the practice of its rulers a more adequate reflection of its own wisdom and virtue <\s>
<s> our rulers i repeat must begin with their own minds <\s>
<s> this is a precept of immediate urgency and if attended to might be productive of immediate good <\s>
<s> i will follow it with further conclusions directly referring to future conduct <\s>
<s> i will not suppose that any ministry of this country can be so abject so insensible and unwise as to abandon the spaniards and portugueze while there is a patriot in arms or if the people should for a time be subjugated to deny them assistance the moment they rise to require it again <\s>
<s> i cannot think so unfavourably of my country as to suppose this possible <\s>
<s> let men in power however take care and let the nation be equally careful not to receive any reports from our army of the disposition of the spanish people without mistrust <\s>
<s> the british generals who were in portugal the whole body of them 21 according to the statement of sir hew dalrymple approved of the convention of cintra and have thereby shewn that their communications are not to be relied upon in this case <\s>
<s> and indeed there is not any information which we can receive upon this subject that is so little trustworthy as that which comes from our army or from any part of it <\s>
<s> the opportunities of notice afforded to soldiers in actual service must necessarily be very limited and a thousand things stand in the way of their power to make a right use of these <\s>
<s> but a retreating army in the country of an ally harrassed and dissatisfied willing to find a reason for its failures in any thing but itself and actually not without much solid ground for complaint retreating sometimes perhaps fugitive and in its disorder tempted and even forced to commit offences upon the people of the district through which it passes while they in their turn are filled with fear and inconsiderate anger an army in such a condition must needs be incapable of seeing objects as they really are and at the same time all things must change in its presence and put on their most unfavourable appearances <\s>
<s> 21 from this number however must be excepted the gallant and patriotic general ferguson <\s>
<s> for that officer has had the virtue publicly and in the most emphatic manner upon two occasions to reprobate the whole transaction <\s>
<s> deeming it then not to be doubted that the british government will continue its endeavours to support its allies one or other of two maxims of policy follows obviously from the painful truths which we have been considering either first that we should put forth to the utmost our strength as a military power strain it to the very last point and prepare no erect mind will start at the proposition to pour into the peninsula a force of two hundred thousand men or more and make ourselves for a time upon spanish ground principals in the contest or secondly that we should direct our attention to giving support rather in things than in men <\s>
<s> the former plan though requiring a great effort and many sacrifices is i have no doubt practicable its difficulties would yield to a bold and energetic ministry in despite of the present constitution of parliament <\s>
<s> the militia if they had been called upon at the beginning of the rising in the peninsula would i believe almost to a man have offered their services so would many of the volunteers in their individual capacity <\s>
<s> they would do so still <\s>
<s> the advantages of this plan would be that the power which would attend it must if judiciously directed insure unity of effort taming down by its dignity the discords which usually prevail among allied armies and subordinating to itself the affections of the spanish and portugueze by the palpable service which it was rendering to their country <\s>
<s> a further encouragement for adopting this plan he will find who perceives that the military power of our enemy is not in substance so formidable by many many degrees of terror as outwardly it appears to be <\s>
<s> the last campaign has not been wholly without advantage since it has proved that the french troops are indebted for their victories to the imbecility of their opponents far more than to their own discipline or courage or even to the skill and talents of their generals <\s>
<s> there is a superstition hanging over us which the efforts of our army not to speak of the spaniards have i hope removed but their mighty numbers in that is a delusion of another kind <\s>
<s> accordingly they are disregarded in some instances and sink insensibly into neglect with the general improvement of society <\s>
<s> but they often survive when they have become an oppression and a hindrance which cannot be cast off decisively but by an impulse rising either from the absolute knowledge of good and great men or from the partial insight which is given to superior minds though of a vitiated moral constitution or lastly from that blind energy and those habits of daring which are often found in men who checked by no restraint of morality suffer their evil passions to gain extraordinary strength in extraordinary circumstances <\s>
<s> by any of these forces may the tyranny be broken through <\s>
<s> we have seen in the conduct of our countrymen to what degree it tempts to weak actions and furnishes excuse for them admitted by those who sit as judges <\s>
<s> i wish then that we could so far imitate our enemies as like them to shake off these bonds but not like them from the worst but from the worthiest impulse <\s>
<s> if this were done we should have learned how much of their practice would harmonize with justice have learned to distinguish between those rules which ought to be wholly abandoned and those which deserve to be retained and should have known when and to what point they ought to be trusted but how is this to be <\s>
<s> power of mind is wanting where there is power of place <\s>
<s> even we cannot as a beginning of a new journey force or win our way into the current of success the flattering motion of which would awaken intellectual courage the only substitute which is able to perform any arduous part of the secondary work of heroic wisdom i mean execute happily any of its prudential regulations <\s>
<s> in the person of our enemy and his chieftains we have living example how wicked men of ordinary talents are emboldened by success <\s>
<s> there is a kindliness as they feel in the nature of advancement and prosperity is their genius <\s>
<s> but let us know and remember that this prosperity with all the terrible features which it has gradually assumed is a child of noble parents liberty and philanthropic love <\s>
<s> perverted as the creature is which it has grown up to rather into which it has passed from no inferior stock could it have issued <\s>
<s> it is the fallen spirit triumphant in misdeeds which was formerly a blessed angel <\s>
<s> if then to return to ourselves there be such strong obstacles in the way of our drawing benefit either from the maxims of policy or the principles of justice what hope remains that the british nation should repair by its future conduct the injury which has been done we cannot advance a step towards a rational answer to this question without previously adverting to the original sources of our miscarriages which are these first a want in the minds of the members of government and public functionaries of knowledge indispensible for this service and secondly a want of power in the same persons acting in their corporate capacities to give effect to the knowledge which individually they possess of the latter source of weakness this inability as caused by decay in the machine of government and by illegitimate forces which are checking and controuling its constitutional motions i have not spoken nor shall i now speak for i have judged it best to suspend my task for a while and this subject being in its nature delicate ought not to be lightly or transiently touched <\s>
<s> besides no immediate effect can be expected from the soundest and most unexceptionable doctrines which might be laid down for the correcting of this evil the former source of weakness namely the want of appropriate and indispensible knowledge has in the past investigation been reached and shall be further laid open not without a hope of some result of immediate good by a direct application to the mind and in full confidence that the best and surest way to render operative that knowledge which is already possessed is to increase the stock of knowledge <\s>
<s> here let me avow that i undertook this present labour as a serious duty rather that it was forced and has been unremittingly pressed upon me by a perception of justice united with strength of feeling in a word by that power of conscience calm or impassioned to which throughout i have done reverence as the animating spirit of the cause <\s>
<s> my work was begun and prosecuted under this controul and with the accompanying satisfaction that no charge of presumption could by a thinking mind be brought against me though i had taken upon myself to offer instruction to men who if they possess not talents and acquirements have no title to the high stations which they hold who also by holding those stations are understood to obtain certain benefit of experience and of knowledge not otherwise to be gained and who have a further claim to deference founded upon reputation even when it is spurious as much of the reputation of men high in power must necessarily be their errors being veiled and palliated by the authority attached to their office while that same authority gives more than due weight and effect to their wiser opinions <\s>
<s> yet notwithstanding all this i did not fear the censure of having unbecomingly obtruded counsels or remonstrances <\s>
<s> for there can be no presumption upon a call so affecting as the present in an attempt to assert the sanctity and to display the efficacy of principles and passions which are the natural birth right of man to some share of which all are born but an inheritance which may be alienated or consumed and by none more readily and assuredly than by those who are most eager for the praise of policy of prudence of sagacity and of all those qualities which are the darling virtues of the worldly wise <\s>
<s> moreover the evidence to which i have made appeal in order to establish the truth is not locked up in cabinets but is accessible to all as it exists in the bosoms of men in the appearances and intercourse of daily life in the details of passing events and in general history <\s>
<s> and more especially is its right import within the reach of him who taking no part in public measures and having no concern in the changes of things but as they affect what is most precious in his country and humanity will doubtless be more alive to those genuine sensations which are the materials of sound judgment <\s>
<s> nor is it to be overlooked that such a man may have more leisure and probably will have a stronger inclination to communicate with the records of past ages <\s>
<s> deeming myself justified then in what has been said i will continue to lay open and in some degree to account for those privations in the materials of judgment and those delusions of opinion and infirmities of mind to which practical statesmen and particularly such as are high in office are more than other men subject as containing an answer to that question so interesting at this juncture how far is it in our power to make amends for the harm done <\s>
<s> after the view of things which has been taken we may confidently affirm that nothing but a knowledge of human nature directing the operations of our government can give it a right to an intimate association with a cause which is that of human nature <\s>
<s> i say an intimate association founded on the right of thorough knowledge to contradistinguish this best mode of exertion from another which might found its right upon a vast and commanding military power put forth with manifestation of sincere intentions to benefit our allies from a conviction merely of policy that their liberty independence and honour are our genuine gain to distinguish the pure brotherly connection from this other in its appearance at least more magisterial which such a power guided by such intention uniformly displayed might authorize <\s>
<s> but of the former connection which supposes the main military effort to be made even at present by the people of the peninsula on whom the moral interest more closely presses and of the knowledge which it demands i have hitherto spoken and have further to speak <\s>
<s> it is plain ?priori that the minds of statesmen and courtiers are unfavourable to the growth of this knowledge <\s>
<s> for they are in a situation exclusive and artificial which has the further disadvantage that it does not separate men from men by collateral partitions which leave along with difference a sense of equality that they who are divided are yet upon the same level but by a degree of superiority which can scarcely fail to be accompanied with more or less of pride <\s>
<s> this situation therefore must be eminently unfavourable for the reception and establishment of that knowledge which is founded not upon things but upon sensations sensations which are general and under general influences and this it is which makes them what they are and gives them their importance ); not upon things which may be brought but upon sensations which must be met <\s>
<s> passing by the kindred and usually accompanying influence of birth in a certain rank and where education has been pre defined from childhood for the express purpose of future political power the tendency of such education to warp and therefore weaken the intellect we may join at once with the privation which i have been noticing a delusion equally common <\s>
<s> it is this that practical statesmen assume too much credit to themselves for their ability to see into the motives and manage the selfish passions of their immediate agents and dependants and for the skill with which they baffle or resist the aims of their opponents <\s>

<s> but of the former connection which supposes the main military effort to be made even at present by the people of the peninsula on whom the moral interest more closely presses and of the knowledge which it demands i have hitherto spoken and have further to speak <\s>

<s> for they are in a situation exclusive and artificial which has the further disadvantage that it does not separate men from men by collateral partitions which leave along with difference a sense of equality that they who are divided are yet upon the same level but by a degree of superiority which can scarcely fail to be accompanied with more or less of pride <\s>
<s> this situation therefore must be eminently unfavourable for the reception and establishment of that knowledge which is founded not upon things but upon sensations sensations which are general and under general influences and this it is which makes them what they are and gives them their importance ); not upon things which may be brought but upon sensations which must be met <\s>

<s> it is this that practical statesmen assume too much credit to themselves for their ability to see into the motives and manage the selfish passions of their immediate agents and dependants and for the skill with which they baffle or resist the aims of their opponents <\s>
<s> a promptness in looking through the most superficial part of the characters of those men who by the very circumstance of their contending ambitiously for the rewards and honours of government are separated from the mass of the society to which they belong is mistaken for a knowledge of human kind <\s>
<s> hence where higher knowledge is a prime requisite they not only are unfurnished but being unconscious that they are so they look down contemptuously upon those who endeavour to supply in some degree their want the instincts of natural and social man the deeper emotions the simpler feelings the spacious range of the disinterested imagination the pride in country for country's sake when to serve has not been a formal profession and the mind is therefore left in a state of dignity only to be surpassed by having served nobly and generously the instantaneous accomplishment in which they start up who upon a searching call stir for the land which they love not from personal motives but for a reward which is undefined and cannot be missed the solemn fraternity which a great nation composes gathered together in a stormy season under the shade of ancestral feeling the delicacy of moral honour which pervades the minds of a people when despair has been suddenly thrown off and expectations are lofty the apprehensiveness to a touch unkindly or irreverent where sympathy is at once exacted as a tribute and welcomed as a gift the power of injustice and inordinate calamity to transmute to invigorate and to govern to sweep away the barriers of opinion to reduce under submission passions purely evil to exalt the nature of indifferent qualities and to render them fit companions for the absolute virtues with which they are summoned to associate to consecrate passions which if not bad in themselves are of such temper that in the calm of ordinary life they are rightly deemed so to correct and embody these passions and without weakening them nay with tenfold addition to their strength to make them worthy of taking their place as the advanced guard of hope when a sublime movement of deliverance is to be originated these arrangements and resources of nature these ways and means of society have so little connection with those others upon which a ruling minister of a long established government is accustomed to depend these elements as it were of a universe functions of a living body are so opposite in their mode of action to the formal machine which it has been his pride to manage that he has but a faint perception of their immediate efficacy knows not the facility with which they assimilate with other powers nor the property by which such of them as from necessity of nature must change or pass away will under wise and fearless management surely generate lawful successors to fill their place when their appropriate work is performed <\s>

<s> i am satisfied that no enlightened patriot will impute to me a wish to disparage the characters of men high in authority or to detract from the estimation which is fairly due to them <\s>

<s> there is danger in being a zealot in any cause not excepting that of humanity <\s>
<s> nor is it to be forgotten that the incapacity and ignorance of the regular agents of long established governments do not prevent some progress in the dearest concerns of men and that society may owe to these very deficiencies and to the tame and unenterprizing course which they necessitate much security and tranquil enjoyment <\s>
<s> nor on the other hand for reasons which may be added to those already given is it so desirable as might at first sight be imagined much less is it desirable as an absolute good that men of comprehensive sensibility and tutored genius either for the interests of mankind or for their own should in ordinary times have vested in them political power <\s>
<s> the empire which they hold is more independent its constituent parts are sustained by a stricter connection the dominion is purer and of higher origin as mind is more excellent than body the search of truth an employment more inherently dignified than the application of force the determinations of nature more venerable than the accidents of human institution <\s>
<s> chance and disorder vexation and disappointment malignity and perverseness within or without the mind are a sad exchange for the steady and genial processes of reason <\s>
<s> moreover worldly distinctions and offices of command do not lie in the path nor are they any part of the appropriate retinue of philosophy and virtue <\s>
<s> nothing but a strong spirit of love can counteract the consciousness of pre eminence which ever attends pre eminent intellectual power with correspondent attainments and this spirit of love is best encouraged by humility and simplicity in mind manners and conduct of life virtues to which wisdom leads <\s>
<s> but though these be virtues in a man a citizen or a sage they cannot be recommended to the especial culture of the political or military functionary and still less of the civil magistrate <\s>

<s> but whatever may be the cause the fact is certain that there is an unconquerable tendency in all power save that of knowledge acting by and through knowledge to injure the mind of him who exercises that power so much so that best natures cannot escape the evil of such alliance <\s>
<s> nor is it less certain that things of soundest quality issuing through a medium to which they have only an arbitrary relation are vitiated and it is inevitable that there should be a reäscent of unkindly influence to the heart of him from whom the gift thus unfairly dealt with proceeded in illustration of these remarks as connected with the management of states we need only refer to the empire of china where superior endowments of mind and acquisitions of learning are the sole acknowledged title to offices of great trust and yet in no country is the government more bigotted or intolerant or society less progressive <\s>
<s> to prevent misconception and to silence at least to throw discredit upon the clamours of ignorance i have thought proper thus in some sort to strike a balance between the claims of men of routine and men of original and accomplished minds to the management of state affairs in ordinary circumstances <\s>
<s> but ours is not an age of this character and after having seen such a long series of misconduct so many unjustifiable attempts made and sometimes carried into effect good endeavours frustrated disinterested wishes thwarted and benevolent hopes disappointed it is reasonable that we should endeavour to ascertain to what cause these evils are to be ascribed <\s>

<s> i have directed the attention of the reader to one primary cause and can he doubt of its existence and of the operation which i have attributed to it <\s>
<s> in the course of the last thirty years we have seen two wars waged against liberty the american war and the war against the french people in the early stages of their revolution <\s>
<s> in the latter instance the emigrants and the continental powers and the british did in all their expectations and in every movement of their efforts manifest a common ignorance originating in the same source <\s>
<s> and for what more especially belongs to ourselves at this time we may affirm that the same presumptuous irreverence of the principles of justice and blank insensibility to the affections of human nature which determined the conduct of our government in those two wars against liberty have continued to accompany its exertions in the present struggle for liberty and have rendered them fruitless <\s>
<s> the british government deems no doubt on its own part that its intentions are good <\s>
<s> it must not deceive itself nor must we deceive ourselves <\s>
<s> intentions thoroughly good could not mingle with the unblessed actions which we have witnessed <\s>
<s> a disinterested and pure intention is a light that guides as well as cheers and renders desperate lapses impossible <\s>
<s> our duty is our aim ought to be to employ the true means of liberty and virtue for the ends of liberty and virtue <\s>
<s> in such policy thoroughly understood there is fitness and concord and rational subordination it deserves a higher name organization health and grandeur <\s>
<s> contrast in a single instance the two processes and the qualifications which they require <\s>
<s> the ministers of that period found it an easy task to hire a band of hessians and to send it across the atlantic that they might assist in bringing the americans according to the phrase then prevalent to reason <\s>
<s> the force with which these troops would attack was gross tangible and might be calculated but the spirit of resistance which their presence would create was subtle ethereal mighty and incalculable <\s>
<s> accordingly from the moment when these foreigners landed men who had no interest no business in the quarrel but what the wages of their master bound him to and he imposed upon his miserable slaves nay from the first rumour of their destination the success of the british was as hath since been affirmed by judicious americans impossible <\s>
<s> the british government of the present day have been seduced as we have seen by the same commonplace facilities on the one side and have been equally blind on the other <\s>
<s> a physical auxiliar force of thirty five thousand men is to be added to the army of spain but the moral energy which thereby might be taken away from the principal is overlooked or slighted the material being too fine for their calculation <\s>
<s> what does it avail to graft a bough upon a tree if this be done so ignorantly and rashly that the trunk which can alone supply the sap by which the whole must flourish receives a deadly wound <\s>
<s> palpable effects of the convention of cintra and self contradicting consequences even in the matter especially aimed at may be seen in the necessity which it entailed of leaving 8,000 british troops to protect portugueze traitors from punishment by the laws of their country <\s>
<s> a still more serious and fatal contradiction lies in this that the english army was made an instrument of injustice and was dishonoured in order that it might be hurried forward to uphold a cause which could have no life but by justice and honour <\s>
<s> the nation knows how that army languished in the heart of spain that it accomplished nothing except its retreat is sure what great service it might have performed if it had moved from a different impulse we have shewn <\s>
<s> it surely then behoves those who are in authority to look to the state of their own minds <\s>
<s> there is indeed an inherent impossibility that they should be equal to the arduous duties which have devolved upon them but it is not unreasonable to hope that something higher might be aimed at and that the people might see upon great occasions in the practice of its rulers a more adequate reflection of its own wisdom and virtue <\s>
<s> our rulers i repeat must begin with their own minds <\s>
<s> this is a precept of immediate urgency and if attended to might be productive of immediate good <\s>
<s> i will follow it with further conclusions directly referring to future conduct <\s>
<s> i will not suppose that any ministry of this country can be so abject so insensible and unwise as to abandon the spaniards and portugueze while there is a patriot in arms or if the people should for a time be subjugated to deny them assistance the moment they rise to require it again <\s>
<s> i cannot think so unfavourably of my country as to suppose this possible <\s>
<s> let men in power however take care and let the nation be equally careful not to receive any reports from our army of the disposition of the spanish people without mistrust <\s>
<s> the british generals who were in portugal the whole body of them 21 according to the statement of sir hew dalrymple approved of the convention of cintra and have thereby shewn that their communications are not to be relied upon in this case <\s>
<s> and indeed there is not any information which we can receive upon this subject that is so little trustworthy as that which comes from our army or from any part of it <\s>
<s> the opportunities of notice afforded to soldiers in actual service must necessarily be very limited and a thousand things stand in the way of their power to make a right use of these <\s>
<s> but a retreating army in the country of an ally harrassed and dissatisfied willing to find a reason for its failures in any thing but itself and actually not without much solid ground for complaint retreating sometimes perhaps fugitive and in its disorder tempted and even forced to commit offences upon the people of the district through which it passes while they in their turn are filled with fear and inconsiderate anger an army in such a condition must needs be incapable of seeing objects as they really are and at the same time all things must change in its presence and put on their most unfavourable appearances <\s>
<s> 21 from this number however must be excepted the gallant and patriotic general ferguson <\s>
<s> for that officer has had the virtue publicly and in the most emphatic manner upon two occasions to reprobate the whole transaction <\s>
<s> deeming it then not to be doubted that the british government will continue its endeavours to support its allies one or other of two maxims of policy follows obviously from the painful truths which we have been considering either first that we should put forth to the utmost our strength as a military power strain it to the very last point and prepare no erect mind will start at the proposition to pour into the peninsula a force of two hundred thousand men or more and make ourselves for a time upon spanish ground principals in the contest or secondly that we should direct our attention to giving support rather in things than in men <\s>
<s> the former plan though requiring a great effort and many sacrifices is i have no doubt practicable its difficulties would yield to a bold and energetic ministry in despite of the present constitution of parliament <\s>
<s> the militia if they had been called upon at the beginning of the rising in the peninsula would i believe almost to a man have offered their services so would many of the volunteers in their individual capacity <\s>
<s> they would do so still <\s>
<s> the advantages of this plan would be that the power which would attend it must if judiciously directed insure unity of effort taming down by its dignity the discords which usually prevail among allied armies and subordinating to itself the affections of the spanish and portugueze by the palpable service which it was rendering to their country <\s>
<s> a further encouragement for adopting this plan he will find who perceives that the military power of our enemy is not in substance so formidable by many many degrees of terror as outwardly it appears to be <\s>
<s> the last campaign has not been wholly without advantage since it has proved that the french troops are indebted for their victories to the imbecility of their opponents far more than to their own discipline or courage or even to the skill and talents of their generals <\s>
<s> there is a superstition hanging over us which the efforts of our army not to speak of the spaniards have i hope removed but their mighty numbers in that is a delusion of another kind <\s>
<s> accordingly they are disregarded in some instances and sink insensibly into neglect with the general improvement of society <\s>
<s> but they often survive when they have become an oppression and a hindrance which cannot be cast off decisively but by an impulse rising either from the absolute knowledge of good and great men or from the partial insight which is given to superior minds though of a vitiated moral constitution or lastly from that blind energy and those habits of daring which are often found in men who checked by no restraint of morality suffer their evil passions to gain extraordinary strength in extraordinary circumstances <\s>
<s> by any of these forces may the tyranny be broken through <\s>
<s> we have seen in the conduct of our countrymen to what degree it tempts to weak actions and furnishes excuse for them admitted by those who sit as judges <\s>
<s> i wish then that we could so far imitate our enemies as like them to shake off these bonds but not like them from the worst but from the worthiest impulse <\s>
<s> if this were done we should have learned how much of their practice would harmonize with justice have learned to distinguish between those rules which ought to be wholly abandoned and those which deserve to be retained and should have known when and to what point they ought to be trusted but how is this to be <\s>
<s> power of mind is wanting where there is power of place <\s>
<s> even we cannot as a beginning of a new journey force or win our way into the current of success the flattering motion of which would awaken intellectual courage the only substitute which is able to perform any arduous part of the secondary work of heroic wisdom i mean execute happily any of its prudential regulations <\s>
<s> in the person of our enemy and his chieftains we have living example how wicked men of ordinary talents are emboldened by success <\s>
<s> there is a kindliness as they feel in the nature of advancement and prosperity is their genius <\s>
<s> but let us know and remember that this prosperity with all the terrible features which it has gradually assumed is a child of noble parents liberty and philanthropic love <\s>
<s> perverted as the creature is which it has grown up to rather into which it has passed from no inferior stock could it have issued <\s>
<s> it is the fallen spirit triumphant in misdeeds which was formerly a blessed angel <\s>
<s> if then to return to ourselves there be such strong obstacles in the way of our drawing benefit either from the maxims of policy or the principles of justice what hope remains that the british nation should repair by its future conduct the injury which has been done we cannot advance a step towards a rational answer to this question without previously adverting to the original sources of our miscarriages which are these first a want in the minds of the members of government and public functionaries of knowledge indispensible for this service and secondly a want of power in the same persons acting in their corporate capacities to give effect to the knowledge which individually they possess of the latter source of weakness this inability as caused by decay in the machine of government and by illegitimate forces which are checking and controuling its constitutional motions i have not spoken nor shall i now speak for i have judged it best to suspend my task for a while and this subject being in its nature delicate ought not to be lightly or transiently touched <\s>
<s> besides no immediate effect can be expected from the soundest and most unexceptionable doctrines which might be laid down for the correcting of this evil the former source of weakness namely the want of appropriate and indispensible knowledge has in the past investigation been reached and shall be further laid open not without a hope of some result of immediate good by a direct application to the mind and in full confidence that the best and surest way to render operative that knowledge which is already possessed is to increase the stock of knowledge <\s>
<s> here let me avow that i undertook this present labour as a serious duty rather that it was forced and has been unremittingly pressed upon me by a perception of justice united with strength of feeling in a word by that power of conscience calm or impassioned to which throughout i have done reverence as the animating spirit of the cause <\s>
<s> my work was begun and prosecuted under this controul and with the accompanying satisfaction that no charge of presumption could by a thinking mind be brought against me though i had taken upon myself to offer instruction to men who if they possess not talents and acquirements have no title to the high stations which they hold who also by holding those stations are understood to obtain certain benefit of experience and of knowledge not otherwise to be gained and who have a further claim to deference founded upon reputation even when it is spurious as much of the reputation of men high in power must necessarily be their errors being veiled and palliated by the authority attached to their office while that same authority gives more than due weight and effect to their wiser opinions <\s>
<s> yet notwithstanding all this i did not fear the censure of having unbecomingly obtruded counsels or remonstrances <\s>
<s> for there can be no presumption upon a call so affecting as the present in an attempt to assert the sanctity and to display the efficacy of principles and passions which are the natural birth right of man to some share of which all are born but an inheritance which may be alienated or consumed and by none more readily and assuredly than by those who are most eager for the praise of policy of prudence of sagacity and of all those qualities which are the darling virtues of the worldly wise <\s>
<s> moreover the evidence to which i have made appeal in order to establish the truth is not locked up in cabinets but is accessible to all as it exists in the bosoms of men in the appearances and intercourse of daily life in the details of passing events and in general history <\s>
<s> and more especially is its right import within the reach of him who taking no part in public measures and having no concern in the changes of things but as they affect what is most precious in his country and humanity will doubtless be more alive to those genuine sensations which are the materials of sound judgment <\s>
<s> nor is it to be overlooked that such a man may have more leisure and probably will have a stronger inclination to communicate with the records of past ages <\s>
<s> deeming myself justified then in what has been said i will continue to lay open and in some degree to account for those privations in the materials of judgment and those delusions of opinion and infirmities of mind to which practical statesmen and particularly such as are high in office are more than other men subject as containing an answer to that question so interesting at this juncture how far is it in our power to make amends for the harm done <\s>

<s> here let me avow that i undertook this present labour as a serious duty rather that it was forced and has been unremittingly pressed upon me by a perception of justice united with strength of feeling in a word by that power of conscience calm or impassioned to which throughout i have done reverence as the animating spirit of the cause <\s>
<s> my work was begun and prosecuted under this controul and with the accompanying satisfaction that no charge of presumption could by a thinking mind be brought against me though i had taken upon myself to offer instruction to men who if they possess not talents and acquirements have no title to the high stations which they hold who also by holding those stations are understood to obtain certain benefit of experience and of knowledge not otherwise to be gained and who have a further claim to deference founded upon reputation even when it is spurious as much of the reputation of men high in power must necessarily be their errors being veiled and palliated by the authority attached to their office while that same authority gives more than due weight and effect to their wiser opinions <\s>
<s> yet notwithstanding all this i did not fear the censure of having unbecomingly obtruded counsels or remonstrances <\s>
<s> for there can be no presumption upon a call so affecting as the present in an attempt to assert the sanctity and to display the efficacy of principles and passions which are the natural birth right of man to some share of which all are born but an inheritance which may be alienated or consumed and by none more readily and assuredly than by those who are most eager for the praise of policy of prudence of sagacity and of all those qualities which are the darling virtues of the worldly wise <\s>
<s> moreover the evidence to which i have made appeal in order to establish the truth is not locked up in cabinets but is accessible to all as it exists in the bosoms of men in the appearances and intercourse of daily life in the details of passing events and in general history <\s>
<s> and more especially is its right import within the reach of him who taking no part in public measures and having no concern in the changes of things but as they affect what is most precious in his country and humanity will doubtless be more alive to those genuine sensations which are the materials of sound judgment <\s>
<s> nor is it to be overlooked that such a man may have more leisure and probably will have a stronger inclination to communicate with the records of past ages <\s>
<s> deeming myself justified then in what has been said i will continue to lay open and in some degree to account for those privations in the materials of judgment and those delusions of opinion and infirmities of mind to which practical statesmen and particularly such as are high in office are more than other men subject as containing an answer to that question so interesting at this juncture how far is it in our power to make amends for the harm done <\s>
<s> after the view of things which has been taken we may confidently affirm that nothing but a knowledge of human nature directing the operations of our government can give it a right to an intimate association with a cause which is that of human nature <\s>
<s> i say an intimate association founded on the right of thorough knowledge to contradistinguish this best mode of exertion from another which might found its right upon a vast and commanding military power put forth with manifestation of sincere intentions to benefit our allies from a conviction merely of policy that their liberty independence and honour are our genuine gain to distinguish the pure brotherly connection from this other in its appearance at least more magisterial which such a power guided by such intention uniformly displayed might authorize <\s>
<s> but of the former connection which supposes the main military effort to be made even at present by the people of the peninsula on whom the moral interest more closely presses and of the knowledge which it demands i have hitherto spoken and have further to speak <\s>
<s> it is plain ?priori that the minds of statesmen and courtiers are unfavourable to the growth of this knowledge <\s>
<s> for they are in a situation exclusive and artificial which has the further disadvantage that it does not separate men from men by collateral partitions which leave along with difference a sense of equality that they who are divided are yet upon the same level but by a degree of superiority which can scarcely fail to be accompanied with more or less of pride <\s>
<s> this situation therefore must be eminently unfavourable for the reception and establishment of that knowledge which is founded not upon things but upon sensations sensations which are general and under general influences and this it is which makes them what they are and gives them their importance ); not upon things which may be brought but upon sensations which must be met <\s>
<s> passing by the kindred and usually accompanying influence of birth in a certain rank and where education has been pre defined from childhood for the express purpose of future political power the tendency of such education to warp and therefore weaken the intellect we may join at once with the privation which i have been noticing a delusion equally common <\s>
<s> it is this that practical statesmen assume too much credit to themselves for their ability to see into the motives and manage the selfish passions of their immediate agents and dependants and for the skill with which they baffle or resist the aims of their opponents <\s>
<s> a promptness in looking through the most superficial part of the characters of those men who by the very circumstance of their contending ambitiously for the rewards and honours of government are separated from the mass of the society to which they belong is mistaken for a knowledge of human kind <\s>
<s> hence where higher knowledge is a prime requisite they not only are unfurnished but being unconscious that they are so they look down contemptuously upon those who endeavour to supply in some degree their want the instincts of natural and social man the deeper emotions the simpler feelings the spacious range of the disinterested imagination the pride in country for country's sake when to serve has not been a formal profession and the mind is therefore left in a state of dignity only to be surpassed by having served nobly and generously the instantaneous accomplishment in which they start up who upon a searching call stir for the land which they love not from personal motives but for a reward which is undefined and cannot be missed the solemn fraternity which a great nation composes gathered together in a stormy season under the shade of ancestral feeling the delicacy of moral honour which pervades the minds of a people when despair has been suddenly thrown off and expectations are lofty the apprehensiveness to a touch unkindly or irreverent where sympathy is at once exacted as a tribute and welcomed as a gift the power of injustice and inordinate calamity to transmute to invigorate and to govern to sweep away the barriers of opinion to reduce under submission passions purely evil to exalt the nature of indifferent qualities and to render them fit companions for the absolute virtues with which they are summoned to associate to consecrate passions which if not bad in themselves are of such temper that in the calm of ordinary life they are rightly deemed so to correct and embody these passions and without weakening them nay with tenfold addition to their strength to make them worthy of taking their place as the advanced guard of hope when a sublime movement of deliverance is to be originated these arrangements and resources of nature these ways and means of society have so little connection with those others upon which a ruling minister of a long established government is accustomed to depend these elements as it were of a universe functions of a living body are so opposite in their mode of action to the formal machine which it has been his pride to manage that he has but a faint perception of their immediate efficacy knows not the facility with which they assimilate with other powers nor the property by which such of them as from necessity of nature must change or pass away will under wise and fearless management surely generate lawful successors to fill their place when their appropriate work is performed <\s>
<s> nay of the majority of men who are usually found in high stations under old governments it may without injustice be said that when they look about them in times alas <\s>
<s> too rare which present the glorious product of such agency to their eyes they have not a right to say with a dejected man in the midst of the woods the rivers the mountains the sunshine and shadows of some transcendant landscape i see not feel how beautiful they are these spectators neither see nor feel <\s>
<s> and it is from the blindness and insensibility of these and the train whom they draw along with them that the throes of nations have been so ill recompensed by the births which have followed and that revolutions after passing from crime to crime and from sorrow to sorrow have often ended in throwing back such heavy reproaches of delusiveness upon their first promises <\s>
<s> i am satisfied that no enlightened patriot will impute to me a wish to disparage the characters of men high in authority or to detract from the estimation which is fairly due to them <\s>
<s> my purpose is to guard against unreasonable expectations <\s>
<s> that specific knowledge the paramount importance of which in the present condition of europe i am insisting upon they who usually fill places of high trust in old governments neither do nor for the most part can possess nor is it necessary for the administration of affairs in ordinary circumstances that they should the progress of their own country and of the other nations of the world in civilization in true refinement in science in religion in morals and in all the real wealth of humanity might indeed be quicker and might correspond more happily with the wishes of the benevolent if governors better understood the rudiments of nature as studied in the walks of common life if they were men who had themselves felt every strong emotion inspired by nature and by fortune taught and could calculate upon the force of the grander passions <\s>
<s> yet at the same time there is temptation in this <\s>
<s> to know may seduce and to have been agitated may compel <\s>
<s> arduous cares are attractive for their own sakes <\s>
<s> great talents are naturally driven towards hazard and difficulty as it is there that they are most sure to find their exercise and their evidence and joy in anticipated triumph the liveliest of all sensations <\s>
<s> moreover magnificent desires when least under the bias of personal feeling dispose the mind more than itself is conscious of to regard commotion with complacency and to watch the aggravations of distress with welcoming from an immoderate confidence that when the appointed day shall come it will be in the power of intellect to relieve <\s>
<s> there is danger in being a zealot in any cause not excepting that of humanity <\s>
<s> nor is it to be forgotten that the incapacity and ignorance of the regular agents of long established governments do not prevent some progress in the dearest concerns of men and that society may owe to these very deficiencies and to the tame and unenterprizing course which they necessitate much security and tranquil enjoyment <\s>
<s> nor on the other hand for reasons which may be added to those already given is it so desirable as might at first sight be imagined much less is it desirable as an absolute good that men of comprehensive sensibility and tutored genius either for the interests of mankind or for their own should in ordinary times have vested in them political power <\s>
<s> the empire which they hold is more independent its constituent parts are sustained by a stricter connection the dominion is purer and of higher origin as mind is more excellent than body the search of truth an employment more inherently dignified than the application of force the determinations of nature more venerable than the accidents of human institution <\s>
<s> chance and disorder vexation and disappointment malignity and perverseness within or without the mind are a sad exchange for the steady and genial processes of reason <\s>
<s> moreover worldly distinctions and offices of command do not lie in the path nor are they any part of the appropriate retinue of philosophy and virtue <\s>
<s> nothing but a strong spirit of love can counteract the consciousness of pre eminence which ever attends pre eminent intellectual power with correspondent attainments and this spirit of love is best encouraged by humility and simplicity in mind manners and conduct of life virtues to which wisdom leads <\s>
<s> but though these be virtues in a man a citizen or a sage they cannot be recommended to the especial culture of the political or military functionary and still less of the civil magistrate <\s>
<s> him in the exercise of his functions it will often become to carry himself highly and with state in order that evil may be suppressed and authority respected by those who have not understanding <\s>
<s> the power also of office whether the duties be discharged well or ill will ensure a never failing supply of flattery and praise and of these a man becoming at once double dealer and dupe may without impeachment of his modesty receive as much as his weakness inclines him to under the shew that the homage is not offered up to himself but to that portion of the public dignity which is lodged in his person <\s>
<s> but whatever may be the cause the fact is certain that there is an unconquerable tendency in all power save that of knowledge acting by and through knowledge to injure the mind of him who exercises that power so much so that best natures cannot escape the evil of such alliance <\s>
<s> nor is it less certain that things of soundest quality issuing through a medium to which they have only an arbitrary relation are vitiated and it is inevitable that there should be a reäscent of unkindly influence to the heart of him from whom the gift thus unfairly dealt with proceeded in illustration of these remarks as connected with the management of states we need only refer to the empire of china where superior endowments of mind and acquisitions of learning are the sole acknowledged title to offices of great trust and yet in no country is the government more bigotted or intolerant or society less progressive <\s>
<s> to prevent misconception and to silence at least to throw discredit upon the clamours of ignorance i have thought proper thus in some sort to strike a balance between the claims of men of routine and men of original and accomplished minds to the management of state affairs in ordinary circumstances <\s>
<s> but ours is not an age of this character and after having seen such a long series of misconduct so many unjustifiable attempts made and sometimes carried into effect good endeavours frustrated disinterested wishes thwarted and benevolent hopes disappointed it is reasonable that we should endeavour to ascertain to what cause these evils are to be ascribed <\s>

<s> i have directed the attention of the reader to one primary cause and can he doubt of its existence and of the operation which i have attributed to it <\s>
<s> in the course of the last thirty years we have seen two wars waged against liberty the american war and the war against the french people in the early stages of their revolution <\s>
<s> in the latter instance the emigrants and the continental powers and the british did in all their expectations and in every movement of their efforts manifest a common ignorance originating in the same source <\s>
<s> and for what more especially belongs to ourselves at this time we may affirm that the same presumptuous irreverence of the principles of justice and blank insensibility to the affections of human nature which determined the conduct of our government in those two wars against liberty have continued to accompany its exertions in the present struggle for liberty and have rendered them fruitless <\s>
<s> the british government deems no doubt on its own part that its intentions are good <\s>
<s> it must not deceive itself nor must we deceive ourselves <\s>
<s> intentions thoroughly good could not mingle with the unblessed actions which we have witnessed <\s>
<s> a disinterested and pure intention is a light that guides as well as cheers and renders desperate lapses impossible <\s>
<s> our duty is our aim ought to be to employ the true means of liberty and virtue for the ends of liberty and virtue <\s>
<s> in such policy thoroughly understood there is fitness and concord and rational subordination it deserves a higher name organization health and grandeur <\s>
<s> contrast in a single instance the two processes and the qualifications which they require <\s>
<s> the ministers of that period found it an easy task to hire a band of hessians and to send it across the atlantic that they might assist in bringing the americans according to the phrase then prevalent to reason <\s>
<s> the force with which these troops would attack was gross tangible and might be calculated but the spirit of resistance which their presence would create was subtle ethereal mighty and incalculable <\s>
<s> accordingly from the moment when these foreigners landed men who had no interest no business in the quarrel but what the wages of their master bound him to and he imposed upon his miserable slaves nay from the first rumour of their destination the success of the british was as hath since been affirmed by judicious americans impossible <\s>
<s> the british government of the present day have been seduced as we have seen by the same commonplace facilities on the one side and have been equally blind on the other <\s>
<s> a physical auxiliar force of thirty five thousand men is to be added to the army of spain but the moral energy which thereby might be taken away from the principal is overlooked or slighted the material being too fine for their calculation <\s>
<s> what does it avail to graft a bough upon a tree if this be done so ignorantly and rashly that the trunk which can alone supply the sap by which the whole must flourish receives a deadly wound <\s>
<s> palpable effects of the convention of cintra and self contradicting consequences even in the matter especially aimed at may be seen in the necessity which it entailed of leaving 8,000 british troops to protect portugueze traitors from punishment by the laws of their country <\s>
<s> a still more serious and fatal contradiction lies in this that the english army was made an instrument of injustice and was dishonoured in order that it might be hurried forward to uphold a cause which could have no life but by justice and honour <\s>
<s> the nation knows how that army languished in the heart of spain that it accomplished nothing except its retreat is sure what great service it might have performed if it had moved from a different impulse we have shewn <\s>
<s> it surely then behoves those who are in authority to look to the state of their own minds <\s>
<s> there is indeed an inherent impossibility that they should be equal to the arduous duties which have devolved upon them but it is not unreasonable to hope that something higher might be aimed at and that the people might see upon great occasions in the practice of its rulers a more adequate reflection of its own wisdom and virtue <\s>
<s> our rulers i repeat must begin with their own minds <\s>
<s> this is a precept of immediate urgency and if attended to might be productive of immediate good <\s>
<s> i will follow it with further conclusions directly referring to future conduct <\s>
<s> i will not suppose that any ministry of this country can be so abject so insensible and unwise as to abandon the spaniards and portugueze while there is a patriot in arms or if the people should for a time be subjugated to deny them assistance the moment they rise to require it again <\s>
<s> i cannot think so unfavourably of my country as to suppose this possible <\s>
<s> let men in power however take care and let the nation be equally careful not to receive any reports from our army of the disposition of the spanish people without mistrust <\s>
<s> the british generals who were in portugal the whole body of them 21 according to the statement of sir hew dalrymple approved of the convention of cintra and have thereby shewn that their communications are not to be relied upon in this case <\s>
<s> and indeed there is not any information which we can receive upon this subject that is so little trustworthy as that which comes from our army or from any part of it <\s>
<s> the opportunities of notice afforded to soldiers in actual service must necessarily be very limited and a thousand things stand in the way of their power to make a right use of these <\s>
<s> but a retreating army in the country of an ally harrassed and dissatisfied willing to find a reason for its failures in any thing but itself and actually not without much solid ground for complaint retreating sometimes perhaps fugitive and in its disorder tempted and even forced to commit offences upon the people of the district through which it passes while they in their turn are filled with fear and inconsiderate anger an army in such a condition must needs be incapable of seeing objects as they really are and at the same time all things must change in its presence and put on their most unfavourable appearances <\s>
<s> 21 from this number however must be excepted the gallant and patriotic general ferguson <\s>
<s> for that officer has had the virtue publicly and in the most emphatic manner upon two occasions to reprobate the whole transaction <\s>
<s> deeming it then not to be doubted that the british government will continue its endeavours to support its allies one or other of two maxims of policy follows obviously from the painful truths which we have been considering either first that we should put forth to the utmost our strength as a military power strain it to the very last point and prepare no erect mind will start at the proposition to pour into the peninsula a force of two hundred thousand men or more and make ourselves for a time upon spanish ground principals in the contest or secondly that we should direct our attention to giving support rather in things than in men <\s>
<s> the former plan though requiring a great effort and many sacrifices is i have no doubt practicable its difficulties would yield to a bold and energetic ministry in despite of the present constitution of parliament <\s>
<s> the militia if they had been called upon at the beginning of the rising in the peninsula would i believe almost to a man have offered their services so would many of the volunteers in their individual capacity <\s>
<s> they would do so still <\s>
<s> the advantages of this plan would be that the power which would attend it must if judiciously directed insure unity of effort taming down by its dignity the discords which usually prevail among allied armies and subordinating to itself the affections of the spanish and portugueze by the palpable service which it was rendering to their country <\s>
<s> a further encouragement for adopting this plan he will find who perceives that the military power of our enemy is not in substance so formidable by many many degrees of terror as outwardly it appears to be <\s>
<s> the last campaign has not been wholly without advantage since it has proved that the french troops are indebted for their victories to the imbecility of their opponents far more than to their own discipline or courage or even to the skill and talents of their generals <\s>
<s> there is a superstition hanging over us which the efforts of our army not to speak of the spaniards have i hope removed but their mighty numbers in that is a delusion of another kind <\s>
<s> accordingly they are disregarded in some instances and sink insensibly into neglect with the general improvement of society <\s>
<s> but they often survive when they have become an oppression and a hindrance which cannot be cast off decisively but by an impulse rising either from the absolute knowledge of good and great men or from the partial insight which is given to superior minds though of a vitiated moral constitution or lastly from that blind energy and those habits of daring which are often found in men who checked by no restraint of morality suffer their evil passions to gain extraordinary strength in extraordinary circumstances <\s>
<s> by any of these forces may the tyranny be broken through <\s>
<s> we have seen in the conduct of our countrymen to what degree it tempts to weak actions and furnishes excuse for them admitted by those who sit as judges <\s>
<s> i wish then that we could so far imitate our enemies as like them to shake off these bonds but not like them from the worst but from the worthiest impulse <\s>
<s> if this were done we should have learned how much of their practice would harmonize with justice have learned to distinguish between those rules which ought to be wholly abandoned and those which deserve to be retained and should have known when and to what point they ought to be trusted but how is this to be <\s>
<s> power of mind is wanting where there is power of place <\s>
<s> even we cannot as a beginning of a new journey force or win our way into the current of success the flattering motion of which would awaken intellectual courage the only substitute which is able to perform any arduous part of the secondary work of heroic wisdom i mean execute happily any of its prudential regulations <\s>
<s> in the person of our enemy and his chieftains we have living example how wicked men of ordinary talents are emboldened by success <\s>
<s> there is a kindliness as they feel in the nature of advancement and prosperity is their genius <\s>
<s> but let us know and remember that this prosperity with all the terrible features which it has gradually assumed is a child of noble parents liberty and philanthropic love <\s>
<s> perverted as the creature is which it has grown up to rather into which it has passed from no inferior stock could it have issued <\s>
<s> it is the fallen spirit triumphant in misdeeds which was formerly a blessed angel <\s>
<s> if then to return to ourselves there be such strong obstacles in the way of our drawing benefit either from the maxims of policy or the principles of justice what hope remains that the british nation should repair by its future conduct the injury which has been done we cannot advance a step towards a rational answer to this question without previously adverting to the original sources of our miscarriages which are these first a want in the minds of the members of government and public functionaries of knowledge indispensible for this service and secondly a want of power in the same persons acting in their corporate capacities to give effect to the knowledge which individually they possess of the latter source of weakness this inability as caused by decay in the machine of government and by illegitimate forces which are checking and controuling its constitutional motions i have not spoken nor shall i now speak for i have judged it best to suspend my task for a while and this subject being in its nature delicate ought not to be lightly or transiently touched <\s>

<s> here let me avow that i undertook this present labour as a serious duty rather that it was forced and has been unremittingly pressed upon me by a perception of justice united with strength of feeling in a word by that power of conscience calm or impassioned to which throughout i have done reverence as the animating spirit of the cause <\s>
<s> my work was begun and prosecuted under this controul and with the accompanying satisfaction that no charge of presumption could by a thinking mind be brought against me though i had taken upon myself to offer instruction to men who if they possess not talents and acquirements have no title to the high stations which they hold who also by holding those stations are understood to obtain certain benefit of experience and of knowledge not otherwise to be gained and who have a further claim to deference founded upon reputation even when it is spurious as much of the reputation of men high in power must necessarily be their errors being veiled and palliated by the authority attached to their office while that same authority gives more than due weight and effect to their wiser opinions <\s>
<s> yet notwithstanding all this i did not fear the censure of having unbecomingly obtruded counsels or remonstrances <\s>
<s> for there can be no presumption upon a call so affecting as the present in an attempt to assert the sanctity and to display the efficacy of principles and passions which are the natural birth right of man to some share of which all are born but an inheritance which may be alienated or consumed and by none more readily and assuredly than by those who are most eager for the praise of policy of prudence of sagacity and of all those qualities which are the darling virtues of the worldly wise <\s>
<s> moreover the evidence to which i have made appeal in order to establish the truth is not locked up in cabinets but is accessible to all as it exists in the bosoms of men in the appearances and intercourse of daily life in the details of passing events and in general history <\s>
<s> and more especially is its right import within the reach of him who taking no part in public measures and having no concern in the changes of things but as they affect what is most precious in his country and humanity will doubtless be more alive to those genuine sensations which are the materials of sound judgment <\s>
<s> nor is it to be overlooked that such a man may have more leisure and probably will have a stronger inclination to communicate with the records of past ages <\s>
<s> deeming myself justified then in what has been said i will continue to lay open and in some degree to account for those privations in the materials of judgment and those delusions of opinion and infirmities of mind to which practical statesmen and particularly such as are high in office are more than other men subject as containing an answer to that question so interesting at this juncture how far is it in our power to make amends for the harm done <\s>
<s> after the view of things which has been taken we may confidently affirm that nothing but a knowledge of human nature directing the operations of our government can give it a right to an intimate association with a cause which is that of human nature <\s>
<s> i say an intimate association founded on the right of thorough knowledge to contradistinguish this best mode of exertion from another which might found its right upon a vast and commanding military power put forth with manifestation of sincere intentions to benefit our allies from a conviction merely of policy that their liberty independence and honour are our genuine gain to distinguish the pure brotherly connection from this other in its appearance at least more magisterial which such a power guided by such intention uniformly displayed might authorize <\s>
<s> but of the former connection which supposes the main military effort to be made even at present by the people of the peninsula on whom the moral interest more closely presses and of the knowledge which it demands i have hitherto spoken and have further to speak <\s>
<s> it is plain ?priori that the minds of statesmen and courtiers are unfavourable to the growth of this knowledge <\s>
<s> for they are in a situation exclusive and artificial which has the further disadvantage that it does not separate men from men by collateral partitions which leave along with difference a sense of equality that they who are divided are yet upon the same level but by a degree of superiority which can scarcely fail to be accompanied with more or less of pride <\s>
<s> this situation therefore must be eminently unfavourable for the reception and establishment of that knowledge which is founded not upon things but upon sensations sensations which are general and under general influences and this it is which makes them what they are and gives them their importance ); not upon things which may be brought but upon sensations which must be met <\s>
<s> passing by the kindred and usually accompanying influence of birth in a certain rank and where education has been pre defined from childhood for the express purpose of future political power the tendency of such education to warp and therefore weaken the intellect we may join at once with the privation which i have been noticing a delusion equally common <\s>
<s> it is this that practical statesmen assume too much credit to themselves for their ability to see into the motives and manage the selfish passions of their immediate agents and dependants and for the skill with which they baffle or resist the aims of their opponents <\s>
<s> a promptness in looking through the most superficial part of the characters of those men who by the very circumstance of their contending ambitiously for the rewards and honours of government are separated from the mass of the society to which they belong is mistaken for a knowledge of human kind <\s>
<s> hence where higher knowledge is a prime requisite they not only are unfurnished but being unconscious that they are so they look down contemptuously upon those who endeavour to supply in some degree their want the instincts of natural and social man the deeper emotions the simpler feelings the spacious range of the disinterested imagination the pride in country for country's sake when to serve has not been a formal profession and the mind is therefore left in a state of dignity only to be surpassed by having served nobly and generously the instantaneous accomplishment in which they start up who upon a searching call stir for the land which they love not from personal motives but for a reward which is undefined and cannot be missed the solemn fraternity which a great nation composes gathered together in a stormy season under the shade of ancestral feeling the delicacy of moral honour which pervades the minds of a people when despair has been suddenly thrown off and expectations are lofty the apprehensiveness to a touch unkindly or irreverent where sympathy is at once exacted as a tribute and welcomed as a gift the power of injustice and inordinate calamity to transmute to invigorate and to govern to sweep away the barriers of opinion to reduce under submission passions purely evil to exalt the nature of indifferent qualities and to render them fit companions for the absolute virtues with which they are summoned to associate to consecrate passions which if not bad in themselves are of such temper that in the calm of ordinary life they are rightly deemed so to correct and embody these passions and without weakening them nay with tenfold addition to their strength to make them worthy of taking their place as the advanced guard of hope when a sublime movement of deliverance is to be originated these arrangements and resources of nature these ways and means of society have so little connection with those others upon which a ruling minister of a long established government is accustomed to depend these elements as it were of a universe functions of a living body are so opposite in their mode of action to the formal machine which it has been his pride to manage that he has but a faint perception of their immediate efficacy knows not the facility with which they assimilate with other powers nor the property by which such of them as from necessity of nature must change or pass away will under wise and fearless management surely generate lawful successors to fill their place when their appropriate work is performed <\s>
<s> nay of the majority of men who are usually found in high stations under old governments it may without injustice be said that when they look about them in times alas <\s>
<s> too rare which present the glorious product of such agency to their eyes they have not a right to say with a dejected man in the midst of the woods the rivers the mountains the sunshine and shadows of some transcendant landscape i see not feel how beautiful they are these spectators neither see nor feel <\s>
<s> and it is from the blindness and insensibility of these and the train whom they draw along with them that the throes of nations have been so ill recompensed by the births which have followed and that revolutions after passing from crime to crime and from sorrow to sorrow have often ended in throwing back such heavy reproaches of delusiveness upon their first promises <\s>
<s> i am satisfied that no enlightened patriot will impute to me a wish to disparage the characters of men high in authority or to detract from the estimation which is fairly due to them <\s>
<s> my purpose is to guard against unreasonable expectations <\s>
<s> that specific knowledge the paramount importance of which in the present condition of europe i am insisting upon they who usually fill places of high trust in old governments neither do nor for the most part can possess nor is it necessary for the administration of affairs in ordinary circumstances that they should the progress of their own country and of the other nations of the world in civilization in true refinement in science in religion in morals and in all the real wealth of humanity might indeed be quicker and might correspond more happily with the wishes of the benevolent if governors better understood the rudiments of nature as studied in the walks of common life if they were men who had themselves felt every strong emotion inspired by nature and by fortune taught and could calculate upon the force of the grander passions <\s>

<s> to prevent misconception and to silence at least to throw discredit upon the clamours of ignorance i have thought proper thus in some sort to strike a balance between the claims of men of routine and men of original and accomplished minds to the management of state affairs in ordinary circumstances <\s>
<s> but ours is not an age of this character and after having seen such a long series of misconduct so many unjustifiable attempts made and sometimes carried into effect good endeavours frustrated disinterested wishes thwarted and benevolent hopes disappointed it is reasonable that we should endeavour to ascertain to what cause these evils are to be ascribed <\s>
<s> i have directed the attention of the reader to one primary cause and can he doubt of its existence and of the operation which i have attributed to it <\s>
<s> in the course of the last thirty years we have seen two wars waged against liberty the american war and the war against the french people in the early stages of their revolution <\s>
<s> in the latter instance the emigrants and the continental powers and the british did in all their expectations and in every movement of their efforts manifest a common ignorance originating in the same source <\s>
<s> and for what more especially belongs to ourselves at this time we may affirm that the same presumptuous irreverence of the principles of justice and blank insensibility to the affections of human nature which determined the conduct of our government in those two wars against liberty have continued to accompany its exertions in the present struggle for liberty and have rendered them fruitless <\s>
<s> the british government deems no doubt on its own part that its intentions are good <\s>
<s> it must not deceive itself nor must we deceive ourselves <\s>
<s> intentions thoroughly good could not mingle with the unblessed actions which we have witnessed <\s>
<s> a disinterested and pure intention is a light that guides as well as cheers and renders desperate lapses impossible <\s>
<s> our duty is our aim ought to be to employ the true means of liberty and virtue for the ends of liberty and virtue <\s>
<s> in such policy thoroughly understood there is fitness and concord and rational subordination it deserves a higher name organization health and grandeur <\s>
<s> contrast in a single instance the two processes and the qualifications which they require <\s>
<s> the ministers of that period found it an easy task to hire a band of hessians and to send it across the atlantic that they might assist in bringing the americans according to the phrase then prevalent to reason <\s>
<s> the force with which these troops would attack was gross tangible and might be calculated but the spirit of resistance which their presence would create was subtle ethereal mighty and incalculable <\s>
<s> accordingly from the moment when these foreigners landed men who had no interest no business in the quarrel but what the wages of their master bound him to and he imposed upon his miserable slaves nay from the first rumour of their destination the success of the british was as hath since been affirmed by judicious americans impossible <\s>
<s> the british government of the present day have been seduced as we have seen by the same commonplace facilities on the one side and have been equally blind on the other <\s>
<s> a physical auxiliar force of thirty five thousand men is to be added to the army of spain but the moral energy which thereby might be taken away from the principal is overlooked or slighted the material being too fine for their calculation <\s>
<s> what does it avail to graft a bough upon a tree if this be done so ignorantly and rashly that the trunk which can alone supply the sap by which the whole must flourish receives a deadly wound <\s>
<s> palpable effects of the convention of cintra and self contradicting consequences even in the matter especially aimed at may be seen in the necessity which it entailed of leaving 8,000 british troops to protect portugueze traitors from punishment by the laws of their country <\s>
<s> a still more serious and fatal contradiction lies in this that the english army was made an instrument of injustice and was dishonoured in order that it might be hurried forward to uphold a cause which could have no life but by justice and honour <\s>
<s> the nation knows how that army languished in the heart of spain that it accomplished nothing except its retreat is sure what great service it might have performed if it had moved from a different impulse we have shewn <\s>
<s> it surely then behoves those who are in authority to look to the state of their own minds <\s>
<s> there is indeed an inherent impossibility that they should be equal to the arduous duties which have devolved upon them but it is not unreasonable to hope that something higher might be aimed at and that the people might see upon great occasions in the practice of its rulers a more adequate reflection of its own wisdom and virtue <\s>
<s> our rulers i repeat must begin with their own minds <\s>
<s> this is a precept of immediate urgency and if attended to might be productive of immediate good <\s>
<s> i will follow it with further conclusions directly referring to future conduct <\s>
<s> i will not suppose that any ministry of this country can be so abject so insensible and unwise as to abandon the spaniards and portugueze while there is a patriot in arms or if the people should for a time be subjugated to deny them assistance the moment they rise to require it again <\s>
<s> i cannot think so unfavourably of my country as to suppose this possible <\s>
<s> let men in power however take care and let the nation be equally careful not to receive any reports from our army of the disposition of the spanish people without mistrust <\s>
<s> the british generals who were in portugal the whole body of them 21 according to the statement of sir hew dalrymple approved of the convention of cintra and have thereby shewn that their communications are not to be relied upon in this case <\s>
<s> and indeed there is not any information which we can receive upon this subject that is so little trustworthy as that which comes from our army or from any part of it <\s>
<s> the opportunities of notice afforded to soldiers in actual service must necessarily be very limited and a thousand things stand in the way of their power to make a right use of these <\s>
<s> but a retreating army in the country of an ally harrassed and dissatisfied willing to find a reason for its failures in any thing but itself and actually not without much solid ground for complaint retreating sometimes perhaps fugitive and in its disorder tempted and even forced to commit offences upon the people of the district through which it passes while they in their turn are filled with fear and inconsiderate anger an army in such a condition must needs be incapable of seeing objects as they really are and at the same time all things must change in its presence and put on their most unfavourable appearances <\s>
<s> 21 from this number however must be excepted the gallant and patriotic general ferguson <\s>
<s> for that officer has had the virtue publicly and in the most emphatic manner upon two occasions to reprobate the whole transaction <\s>
<s> deeming it then not to be doubted that the british government will continue its endeavours to support its allies one or other of two maxims of policy follows obviously from the painful truths which we have been considering either first that we should put forth to the utmost our strength as a military power strain it to the very last point and prepare no erect mind will start at the proposition to pour into the peninsula a force of two hundred thousand men or more and make ourselves for a time upon spanish ground principals in the contest or secondly that we should direct our attention to giving support rather in things than in men <\s>
<s> the former plan though requiring a great effort and many sacrifices is i have no doubt practicable its difficulties would yield to a bold and energetic ministry in despite of the present constitution of parliament <\s>
<s> the militia if they had been called upon at the beginning of the rising in the peninsula would i believe almost to a man have offered their services so would many of the volunteers in their individual capacity <\s>
<s> they would do so still <\s>
<s> the advantages of this plan would be that the power which would attend it must if judiciously directed insure unity of effort taming down by its dignity the discords which usually prevail among allied armies and subordinating to itself the affections of the spanish and portugueze by the palpable service which it was rendering to their country <\s>
<s> a further encouragement for adopting this plan he will find who perceives that the military power of our enemy is not in substance so formidable by many many degrees of terror as outwardly it appears to be <\s>
<s> the last campaign has not been wholly without advantage since it has proved that the french troops are indebted for their victories to the imbecility of their opponents far more than to their own discipline or courage or even to the skill and talents of their generals <\s>
<s> there is a superstition hanging over us which the efforts of our army not to speak of the spaniards have i hope removed but their mighty numbers in that is a delusion of another kind <\s>
<s> accordingly they are disregarded in some instances and sink insensibly into neglect with the general improvement of society <\s>
<s> but they often survive when they have become an oppression and a hindrance which cannot be cast off decisively but by an impulse rising either from the absolute knowledge of good and great men or from the partial insight which is given to superior minds though of a vitiated moral constitution or lastly from that blind energy and those habits of daring which are often found in men who checked by no restraint of morality suffer their evil passions to gain extraordinary strength in extraordinary circumstances <\s>
<s> by any of these forces may the tyranny be broken through <\s>
<s> we have seen in the conduct of our countrymen to what degree it tempts to weak actions and furnishes excuse for them admitted by those who sit as judges <\s>
<s> i wish then that we could so far imitate our enemies as like them to shake off these bonds but not like them from the worst but from the worthiest impulse <\s>
<s> if this were done we should have learned how much of their practice would harmonize with justice have learned to distinguish between those rules which ought to be wholly abandoned and those which deserve to be retained and should have known when and to what point they ought to be trusted but how is this to be <\s>
<s> power of mind is wanting where there is power of place <\s>
<s> even we cannot as a beginning of a new journey force or win our way into the current of success the flattering motion of which would awaken intellectual courage the only substitute which is able to perform any arduous part of the secondary work of heroic wisdom i mean execute happily any of its prudential regulations <\s>
<s> in the person of our enemy and his chieftains we have living example how wicked men of ordinary talents are emboldened by success <\s>

<s> but they often survive when they have become an oppression and a hindrance which cannot be cast off decisively but by an impulse rising either from the absolute knowledge of good and great men or from the partial insight which is given to superior minds though of a vitiated moral constitution or lastly from that blind energy and those habits of daring which are often found in men who checked by no restraint of morality suffer their evil passions to gain extraordinary strength in extraordinary circumstances <\s>

<s> if then to return to ourselves there be such strong obstacles in the way of our drawing benefit either from the maxims of policy or the principles of justice what hope remains that the british nation should repair by its future conduct the injury which has been done we cannot advance a step towards a rational answer to this question without previously adverting to the original sources of our miscarriages which are these first a want in the minds of the members of government and public functionaries of knowledge indispensible for this service and secondly a want of power in the same persons acting in their corporate capacities to give effect to the knowledge which individually they possess of the latter source of weakness this inability as caused by decay in the machine of government and by illegitimate forces which are checking and controuling its constitutional motions i have not spoken nor shall i now speak for i have judged it best to suspend my task for a while and this subject being in its nature delicate ought not to be lightly or transiently touched <\s>
<s> besides no immediate effect can be expected from the soundest and most unexceptionable doctrines which might be laid down for the correcting of this evil the former source of weakness namely the want of appropriate and indispensible knowledge has in the past investigation been reached and shall be further laid open not without a hope of some result of immediate good by a direct application to the mind and in full confidence that the best and surest way to render operative that knowledge which is already possessed is to increase the stock of knowledge <\s>
<s> here let me avow that i undertook this present labour as a serious duty rather that it was forced and has been unremittingly pressed upon me by a perception of justice united with strength of feeling in a word by that power of conscience calm or impassioned to which throughout i have done reverence as the animating spirit of the cause <\s>
<s> my work was begun and prosecuted under this controul and with the accompanying satisfaction that no charge of presumption could by a thinking mind be brought against me though i had taken upon myself to offer instruction to men who if they possess not talents and acquirements have no title to the high stations which they hold who also by holding those stations are understood to obtain certain benefit of experience and of knowledge not otherwise to be gained and who have a further claim to deference founded upon reputation even when it is spurious as much of the reputation of men high in power must necessarily be their errors being veiled and palliated by the authority attached to their office while that same authority gives more than due weight and effect to their wiser opinions <\s>
<s> yet notwithstanding all this i did not fear the censure of having unbecomingly obtruded counsels or remonstrances <\s>
<s> for there can be no presumption upon a call so affecting as the present in an attempt to assert the sanctity and to display the efficacy of principles and passions which are the natural birth right of man to some share of which all are born but an inheritance which may be alienated or consumed and by none more readily and assuredly than by those who are most eager for the praise of policy of prudence of sagacity and of all those qualities which are the darling virtues of the worldly wise <\s>
<s> moreover the evidence to which i have made appeal in order to establish the truth is not locked up in cabinets but is accessible to all as it exists in the bosoms of men in the appearances and intercourse of daily life in the details of passing events and in general history <\s>
<s> and more especially is its right import within the reach of him who taking no part in public measures and having no concern in the changes of things but as they affect what is most precious in his country and humanity will doubtless be more alive to those genuine sensations which are the materials of sound judgment <\s>
<s> nor is it to be overlooked that such a man may have more leisure and probably will have a stronger inclination to communicate with the records of past ages <\s>
<s> deeming myself justified then in what has been said i will continue to lay open and in some degree to account for those privations in the materials of judgment and those delusions of opinion and infirmities of mind to which practical statesmen and particularly such as are high in office are more than other men subject as containing an answer to that question so interesting at this juncture how far is it in our power to make amends for the harm done <\s>
<s> after the view of things which has been taken we may confidently affirm that nothing but a knowledge of human nature directing the operations of our government can give it a right to an intimate association with a cause which is that of human nature <\s>
<s> i say an intimate association founded on the right of thorough knowledge to contradistinguish this best mode of exertion from another which might found its right upon a vast and commanding military power put forth with manifestation of sincere intentions to benefit our allies from a conviction merely of policy that their liberty independence and honour are our genuine gain to distinguish the pure brotherly connection from this other in its appearance at least more magisterial which such a power guided by such intention uniformly displayed might authorize <\s>
<s> but of the former connection which supposes the main military effort to be made even at present by the people of the peninsula on whom the moral interest more closely presses and of the knowledge which it demands i have hitherto spoken and have further to speak <\s>
<s> it is plain ?priori that the minds of statesmen and courtiers are unfavourable to the growth of this knowledge <\s>
<s> for they are in a situation exclusive and artificial which has the further disadvantage that it does not separate men from men by collateral partitions which leave along with difference a sense of equality that they who are divided are yet upon the same level but by a degree of superiority which can scarcely fail to be accompanied with more or less of pride <\s>
<s> this situation therefore must be eminently unfavourable for the reception and establishment of that knowledge which is founded not upon things but upon sensations sensations which are general and under general influences and this it is which makes them what they are and gives them their importance ); not upon things which may be brought but upon sensations which must be met <\s>
<s> passing by the kindred and usually accompanying influence of birth in a certain rank and where education has been pre defined from childhood for the express purpose of future political power the tendency of such education to warp and therefore weaken the intellect we may join at once with the privation which i have been noticing a delusion equally common <\s>
<s> it is this that practical statesmen assume too much credit to themselves for their ability to see into the motives and manage the selfish passions of their immediate agents and dependants and for the skill with which they baffle or resist the aims of their opponents <\s>
<s> a promptness in looking through the most superficial part of the characters of those men who by the very circumstance of their contending ambitiously for the rewards and honours of government are separated from the mass of the society to which they belong is mistaken for a knowledge of human kind <\s>
<s> hence where higher knowledge is a prime requisite they not only are unfurnished but being unconscious that they are so they look down contemptuously upon those who endeavour to supply in some degree their want the instincts of natural and social man the deeper emotions the simpler feelings the spacious range of the disinterested imagination the pride in country for country's sake when to serve has not been a formal profession and the mind is therefore left in a state of dignity only to be surpassed by having served nobly and generously the instantaneous accomplishment in which they start up who upon a searching call stir for the land which they love not from personal motives but for a reward which is undefined and cannot be missed the solemn fraternity which a great nation composes gathered together in a stormy season under the shade of ancestral feeling the delicacy of moral honour which pervades the minds of a people when despair has been suddenly thrown off and expectations are lofty the apprehensiveness to a touch unkindly or irreverent where sympathy is at once exacted as a tribute and welcomed as a gift the power of injustice and inordinate calamity to transmute to invigorate and to govern to sweep away the barriers of opinion to reduce under submission passions purely evil to exalt the nature of indifferent qualities and to render them fit companions for the absolute virtues with which they are summoned to associate to consecrate passions which if not bad in themselves are of such temper that in the calm of ordinary life they are rightly deemed so to correct and embody these passions and without weakening them nay with tenfold addition to their strength to make them worthy of taking their place as the advanced guard of hope when a sublime movement of deliverance is to be originated these arrangements and resources of nature these ways and means of society have so little connection with those others upon which a ruling minister of a long established government is accustomed to depend these elements as it were of a universe functions of a living body are so opposite in their mode of action to the formal machine which it has been his pride to manage that he has but a faint perception of their immediate efficacy knows not the facility with which they assimilate with other powers nor the property by which such of them as from necessity of nature must change or pass away will under wise and fearless management surely generate lawful successors to fill their place when their appropriate work is performed <\s>
<s> nay of the majority of men who are usually found in high stations under old governments it may without injustice be said that when they look about them in times alas <\s>
<s> too rare which present the glorious product of such agency to their eyes they have not a right to say with a dejected man in the midst of the woods the rivers the mountains the sunshine and shadows of some transcendant landscape i see not feel how beautiful they are these spectators neither see nor feel <\s>
<s> and it is from the blindness and insensibility of these and the train whom they draw along with them that the throes of nations have been so ill recompensed by the births which have followed and that revolutions after passing from crime to crime and from sorrow to sorrow have often ended in throwing back such heavy reproaches of delusiveness upon their first promises <\s>
<s> i am satisfied that no enlightened patriot will impute to me a wish to disparage the characters of men high in authority or to detract from the estimation which is fairly due to them <\s>
<s> my purpose is to guard against unreasonable expectations <\s>
<s> that specific knowledge the paramount importance of which in the present condition of europe i am insisting upon they who usually fill places of high trust in old governments neither do nor for the most part can possess nor is it necessary for the administration of affairs in ordinary circumstances that they should the progress of their own country and of the other nations of the world in civilization in true refinement in science in religion in morals and in all the real wealth of humanity might indeed be quicker and might correspond more happily with the wishes of the benevolent if governors better understood the rudiments of nature as studied in the walks of common life if they were men who had themselves felt every strong emotion inspired by nature and by fortune taught and could calculate upon the force of the grander passions <\s>

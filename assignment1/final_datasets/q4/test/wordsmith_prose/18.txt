<s> 43 entitled resolution and independence <\s>
<s> and again on the same poem i will explain to you in prose my feelings in writing that poem .... <\s>
<s> i describe myself as having been exalted to the highest pitch of delight by the joyousness and beauty of nature and then as depressed even in the midst of those beautiful objects to the lowest dejection and despair <\s>

<s> some have little knowledge of natural imagery of any kind and of course little relish for it some are disgusted with the very mention of the words pastoral poetry sheep or shepherds some cannot tolerate a poem with a ghost or any supernatural agency in it others would shrink from an animated description of the pleasures of love as from a thing carnal and libidinous some cannot bear to see delicate and refined feelings ascribed to men in low conditions in society because their vanity and self love tell them that these belong only to themselves and men like themselves in dress station and way of life others are disgusted with the naked language of some of the most interesting passions of men because either it is indelicate or gross or vulgar as many fine ladies could not bear certain expressions in the mother and the thorn and as in the instance of adam smith who we are told could not endure the ballad of clym of the clough because the author had not written like a gentleman <\s>
<s> then there are professional and national prejudices for evermore <\s>
<s> some take no interest in the description of a particular passion or quality as love of solitariness we will say genial activity of fancy love of nature religion and so forth because they have little or nothing of it in themselves and so on without end <\s>
<s> i return then to the question please whom <\s>
<s> i answer human nature as it has been and ever will be <\s>
<s> but where are we to find the best measure of this <\s>
<s> i answer from with in by stripping our own hearts naked and by looking out of ourselves to wards men who lead the simplest lives and most according to nature men who have never known false refinements wayward and artificial desires false criticisms effeminate habits of thinking and feeling or who having known these things have outgrown them <\s>
<s> this latter class is the most to be depended upon but it is very small in number <\s>
<s> people in our rank in life are perpetually falling into one sad mistake namely that of supposing that human nature and the persons they associate with are one and the same thing <\s>
<s> whom do we generally associate with <\s>
<s> gentlemen persons of fortune professional men ladies persons who can afford to buy or can easily procure books of half a guinea price hot pressed and printed upon superfine paper <\s>
<s> these persons are it is true a part of human nature but we err lamentably if we suppose them to be fair representatives of the vast mass of human existence <\s>
<s> and yet few ever consider books but with reference to their power of pleasing these persons and men of a higher rank few descend lower among cottages and fields and among children <\s>
<s> a man must have done this habitually before his judgment upon the idiot boy would be in any way decisive with me <\s>
<s> i know i have done this myself habitually i wrote the poem with exceeding delight and pleasure and whenever i read it i read it with pleasure <\s>
<s> you have given me praise for having reflected faithfully in my poems the feelings of human nature <\s>
<s> i would fain hope that i have done so <\s>
<s> but a great poet ought to do more than this he ought to a certain degree to rectify men's feelings to give them new compositions of feeling to render their feelings more sane pure and permanent in short more consonant to nature that is to eternal nature and the great moving spirit of things <\s>
<s> he ought to travel before men occasionally as well as at their sides <\s>
<s> i may illustrate this by a reference to natural objects <\s>
<s> what false notions have prevailed from generation to generation of the true character of the nightingale <\s>
<s> as far as my friend's poem in the lyrical ballads is read it will contribute greatly to rectify these <\s>
<s> you will recollect a passage in cowper where speaking of rural sounds he says and even the boding owl that hails the rising moon has charms for me <\s>
<s> cowper was passionately fond of natural objects yet you see he mentions it as a marvellous thing that he could connect pleasure with the cry of the owl <\s>
<s> in the same poem he speaks in the same manner of that beautiful plant the gorse making in some degree an amiable boast of his loving it unsightly and unsmooth as it is <\s>
<s> there are many aversions of this kind which though they have some foundation in nature have yet so slight a one that though they may have prevailed hundreds of years a philosopher will look upon them as accidents <\s>
<s> so with respect to many moral feelings either of love or dislike <\s>
<s> what excessive admiration was paid in former times to personal prowess and military success it is so with the latter even at the present day but surely not nearly so much as heretofore <\s>
<s> so with regard to birth and innumerable other modes of sentiment civil and religious <\s>
<s> but you will be inclined to ask by this time how all this applies to the idiot boy <\s>
<s> to this i can only say that the loathing and disgust which many people have at the sight of an idiot is a feeling which though having some foundation in human nature is not necessarily attached to it in any virtuous degree but is owing in a great measure to a false delicacy and if i may say it without rudeness a certain want of comprehensiveness of thinking and feeling <\s>
<s> persons in the lower classes of society have little or nothing of this if an idiot is born in a poor man's house it must be taken care of and cannot be boarded out as it would be by gentlefolks or sent to a public or private receptacle for such unfortunate beings <\s>
<s> poor people seeing frequently among their neighbours such objects easily forget whatever there is of natural disgust about them and have therefore a sane state so that without pain or suffering they perform their duties towards them <\s>
<s> i could with pleasure pursue this subject but i must now strictly adopt the plan which i proposed to myself when i began to write this letter namely that of setting down a few hints or memorandums which you will think of for my sake <\s>
<s> i have often applied to idiots in my own mind that sublime expression of scripture that their life is hidden with god they are worshipped probably from a feeling of this sort in several parts of the east <\s>
<s> among the alps where they are numerous they are considered i believe as a blessing to the family to which they belong <\s>
<s> i have indeed often looked upon the conduct of fathers and mothers of the lower classes of society towards idiots as the great triumph of the human heart <\s>
<s> it is there that we see the strength disinterestedness and grandeur of love nor have i ever been able to contemplate an object that calls out so many excellent and virtuous sentiments without finding it hallowed thereby and having something in me which bears down before it like a deluge every feeble sensation of disgust and aversion <\s>
<s> there are in my opinion several important mistakes in the latter part of your letter which i could have wished to notice but i find myself much fatigued <\s>
<s> these refer both to the boy and the mother <\s>
<s> i must content myself simply with observing that it is probable that the principal cause of your dislike to this particular poem lies in the word idiot <\s>
<s> if there had been any such word in our language to which we had attached passion as lack wit half wit witless c i should have certainly employed it in preference but there is no such word <\s>
<s> observe this is entirely in reference to this particular poem my idiot is not one of those who cannot articulate and such as are usually disgusting in their persons whether in cunning or in joy and then his words were not a few c and the last speech at the end of the poem <\s>

<s> some have little knowledge of natural imagery of any kind and of course little relish for it some are disgusted with the very mention of the words pastoral poetry sheep or shepherds some cannot tolerate a poem with a ghost or any supernatural agency in it others would shrink from an animated description of the pleasures of love as from a thing carnal and libidinous some cannot bear to see delicate and refined feelings ascribed to men in low conditions in society because their vanity and self love tell them that these belong only to themselves and men like themselves in dress station and way of life others are disgusted with the naked language of some of the most interesting passions of men because either it is indelicate or gross or vulgar as many fine ladies could not bear certain expressions in the mother and the thorn and as in the instance of adam smith who we are told could not endure the ballad of clym of the clough because the author had not written like a gentleman <\s>
<s> then there are professional and national prejudices for evermore <\s>
<s> some take no interest in the description of a particular passion or quality as love of solitariness we will say genial activity of fancy love of nature religion and so forth because they have little or nothing of it in themselves and so on without end <\s>
<s> i return then to the question please whom <\s>
<s> i answer human nature as it has been and ever will be <\s>
<s> but where are we to find the best measure of this <\s>
<s> i answer from with in by stripping our own hearts naked and by looking out of ourselves to wards men who lead the simplest lives and most according to nature men who have never known false refinements wayward and artificial desires false criticisms effeminate habits of thinking and feeling or who having known these things have outgrown them <\s>
<s> this latter class is the most to be depended upon but it is very small in number <\s>
<s> people in our rank in life are perpetually falling into one sad mistake namely that of supposing that human nature and the persons they associate with are one and the same thing <\s>
<s> whom do we generally associate with <\s>
<s> gentlemen persons of fortune professional men ladies persons who can afford to buy or can easily procure books of half a guinea price hot pressed and printed upon superfine paper <\s>
<s> these persons are it is true a part of human nature but we err lamentably if we suppose them to be fair representatives of the vast mass of human existence <\s>
<s> and yet few ever consider books but with reference to their power of pleasing these persons and men of a higher rank few descend lower among cottages and fields and among children <\s>
<s> a man must have done this habitually before his judgment upon the idiot boy would be in any way decisive with me <\s>
<s> i know i have done this myself habitually i wrote the poem with exceeding delight and pleasure and whenever i read it i read it with pleasure <\s>
<s> you have given me praise for having reflected faithfully in my poems the feelings of human nature <\s>
<s> i would fain hope that i have done so <\s>
<s> but a great poet ought to do more than this he ought to a certain degree to rectify men's feelings to give them new compositions of feeling to render their feelings more sane pure and permanent in short more consonant to nature that is to eternal nature and the great moving spirit of things <\s>
<s> he ought to travel before men occasionally as well as at their sides <\s>
<s> i may illustrate this by a reference to natural objects <\s>
<s> what false notions have prevailed from generation to generation of the true character of the nightingale <\s>
<s> as far as my friend's poem in the lyrical ballads is read it will contribute greatly to rectify these <\s>
<s> you will recollect a passage in cowper where speaking of rural sounds he says and even the boding owl that hails the rising moon has charms for me <\s>
<s> cowper was passionately fond of natural objects yet you see he mentions it as a marvellous thing that he could connect pleasure with the cry of the owl <\s>
<s> in the same poem he speaks in the same manner of that beautiful plant the gorse making in some degree an amiable boast of his loving it unsightly and unsmooth as it is <\s>
<s> there are many aversions of this kind which though they have some foundation in nature have yet so slight a one that though they may have prevailed hundreds of years a philosopher will look upon them as accidents <\s>
<s> so with respect to many moral feelings either of love or dislike <\s>
<s> what excessive admiration was paid in former times to personal prowess and military success it is so with the latter even at the present day but surely not nearly so much as heretofore <\s>
<s> so with regard to birth and innumerable other modes of sentiment civil and religious <\s>
<s> but you will be inclined to ask by this time how all this applies to the idiot boy <\s>
<s> to this i can only say that the loathing and disgust which many people have at the sight of an idiot is a feeling which though having some foundation in human nature is not necessarily attached to it in any virtuous degree but is owing in a great measure to a false delicacy and if i may say it without rudeness a certain want of comprehensiveness of thinking and feeling <\s>
<s> persons in the lower classes of society have little or nothing of this if an idiot is born in a poor man's house it must be taken care of and cannot be boarded out as it would be by gentlefolks or sent to a public or private receptacle for such unfortunate beings <\s>
<s> poor people seeing frequently among their neighbours such objects easily forget whatever there is of natural disgust about them and have therefore a sane state so that without pain or suffering they perform their duties towards them <\s>
<s> i could with pleasure pursue this subject but i must now strictly adopt the plan which i proposed to myself when i began to write this letter namely that of setting down a few hints or memorandums which you will think of for my sake <\s>
<s> i have often applied to idiots in my own mind that sublime expression of scripture that their life is hidden with god they are worshipped probably from a feeling of this sort in several parts of the east <\s>
<s> among the alps where they are numerous they are considered i believe as a blessing to the family to which they belong <\s>
<s> i have indeed often looked upon the conduct of fathers and mothers of the lower classes of society towards idiots as the great triumph of the human heart <\s>
<s> it is there that we see the strength disinterestedness and grandeur of love nor have i ever been able to contemplate an object that calls out so many excellent and virtuous sentiments without finding it hallowed thereby and having something in me which bears down before it like a deluge every feeble sensation of disgust and aversion <\s>
<s> there are in my opinion several important mistakes in the latter part of your letter which i could have wished to notice but i find myself much fatigued <\s>
<s> these refer both to the boy and the mother <\s>
<s> i must content myself simply with observing that it is probable that the principal cause of your dislike to this particular poem lies in the word idiot <\s>
<s> if there had been any such word in our language to which we had attached passion as lack wit half wit witless c i should have certainly employed it in preference but there is no such word <\s>
<s> observe this is entirely in reference to this particular poem my idiot is not one of those who cannot articulate and such as are usually disgusting in their persons whether in cunning or in joy and then his words were not a few c and the last speech at the end of the poem <\s>
<s> ideoque imperitis quoque si modo sint aliquo affectu concitati verba non desunt <\s>
<s> the poems are faithful copies from nature and i hope whatever effect they may have upon you you will at least be able to perceive that they may excite profitable sympathies in many kind and good hearts and may in some small degree enlarge our feelings of reverence for our species and our knowledge of human nature by showing that our best qualities are possessed by men whom we are too apt to consider not with reference to the points in which they resemble us but to those in which they manifestly differ from us <\s>
<s> i thought at a time when these feelings are sapped in so many ways that the two poems might co operate however feebly with the illustrious efforts which you have made to stem this and other evils with which the country is labouring and it is on this account alone that i have taken the liberty of thus addressing you <\s>

<s> how dead soever many full grown men may outwardly seem to these things all are more or less affected by them and in childhood in the first practice and exercise of their senses they must have been not the nourishers merely but often the fathers of their passions <\s>

<s> some take no interest in the description of a particular passion or quality as love of solitariness we will say genial activity of fancy love of nature religion and so forth because they have little or nothing of it in themselves and so on without end <\s>
<s> i return then to the question please whom <\s>
<s> i answer human nature as it has been and ever will be <\s>
<s> but where are we to find the best measure of this <\s>
<s> i answer from with in by stripping our own hearts naked and by looking out of ourselves to wards men who lead the simplest lives and most according to nature men who have never known false refinements wayward and artificial desires false criticisms effeminate habits of thinking and feeling or who having known these things have outgrown them <\s>
<s> this latter class is the most to be depended upon but it is very small in number <\s>
<s> people in our rank in life are perpetually falling into one sad mistake namely that of supposing that human nature and the persons they associate with are one and the same thing <\s>
<s> whom do we generally associate with <\s>
<s> gentlemen persons of fortune professional men ladies persons who can afford to buy or can easily procure books of half a guinea price hot pressed and printed upon superfine paper <\s>
<s> these persons are it is true a part of human nature but we err lamentably if we suppose them to be fair representatives of the vast mass of human existence <\s>
<s> and yet few ever consider books but with reference to their power of pleasing these persons and men of a higher rank few descend lower among cottages and fields and among children <\s>
<s> a man must have done this habitually before his judgment upon the idiot boy would be in any way decisive with me <\s>
<s> i know i have done this myself habitually i wrote the poem with exceeding delight and pleasure and whenever i read it i read it with pleasure <\s>
<s> you have given me praise for having reflected faithfully in my poems the feelings of human nature <\s>
<s> i would fain hope that i have done so <\s>
<s> but a great poet ought to do more than this he ought to a certain degree to rectify men's feelings to give them new compositions of feeling to render their feelings more sane pure and permanent in short more consonant to nature that is to eternal nature and the great moving spirit of things <\s>
<s> he ought to travel before men occasionally as well as at their sides <\s>
<s> i may illustrate this by a reference to natural objects <\s>
<s> what false notions have prevailed from generation to generation of the true character of the nightingale <\s>
<s> as far as my friend's poem in the lyrical ballads is read it will contribute greatly to rectify these <\s>
<s> you will recollect a passage in cowper where speaking of rural sounds he says and even the boding owl that hails the rising moon has charms for me <\s>
<s> cowper was passionately fond of natural objects yet you see he mentions it as a marvellous thing that he could connect pleasure with the cry of the owl <\s>
<s> in the same poem he speaks in the same manner of that beautiful plant the gorse making in some degree an amiable boast of his loving it unsightly and unsmooth as it is <\s>
<s> there are many aversions of this kind which though they have some foundation in nature have yet so slight a one that though they may have prevailed hundreds of years a philosopher will look upon them as accidents <\s>
<s> so with respect to many moral feelings either of love or dislike <\s>
<s> what excessive admiration was paid in former times to personal prowess and military success it is so with the latter even at the present day but surely not nearly so much as heretofore <\s>
<s> so with regard to birth and innumerable other modes of sentiment civil and religious <\s>
<s> but you will be inclined to ask by this time how all this applies to the idiot boy <\s>
<s> to this i can only say that the loathing and disgust which many people have at the sight of an idiot is a feeling which though having some foundation in human nature is not necessarily attached to it in any virtuous degree but is owing in a great measure to a false delicacy and if i may say it without rudeness a certain want of comprehensiveness of thinking and feeling <\s>
<s> persons in the lower classes of society have little or nothing of this if an idiot is born in a poor man's house it must be taken care of and cannot be boarded out as it would be by gentlefolks or sent to a public or private receptacle for such unfortunate beings <\s>
<s> poor people seeing frequently among their neighbours such objects easily forget whatever there is of natural disgust about them and have therefore a sane state so that without pain or suffering they perform their duties towards them <\s>
<s> i could with pleasure pursue this subject but i must now strictly adopt the plan which i proposed to myself when i began to write this letter namely that of setting down a few hints or memorandums which you will think of for my sake <\s>
<s> i have often applied to idiots in my own mind that sublime expression of scripture that their life is hidden with god they are worshipped probably from a feeling of this sort in several parts of the east <\s>
<s> among the alps where they are numerous they are considered i believe as a blessing to the family to which they belong <\s>
<s> i have indeed often looked upon the conduct of fathers and mothers of the lower classes of society towards idiots as the great triumph of the human heart <\s>
<s> it is there that we see the strength disinterestedness and grandeur of love nor have i ever been able to contemplate an object that calls out so many excellent and virtuous sentiments without finding it hallowed thereby and having something in me which bears down before it like a deluge every feeble sensation of disgust and aversion <\s>
<s> there are in my opinion several important mistakes in the latter part of your letter which i could have wished to notice but i find myself much fatigued <\s>
<s> these refer both to the boy and the mother <\s>
<s> i must content myself simply with observing that it is probable that the principal cause of your dislike to this particular poem lies in the word idiot <\s>
<s> if there had been any such word in our language to which we had attached passion as lack wit half wit witless c i should have certainly employed it in preference but there is no such word <\s>
<s> observe this is entirely in reference to this particular poem my idiot is not one of those who cannot articulate and such as are usually disgusting in their persons whether in cunning or in joy and then his words were not a few c and the last speech at the end of the poem <\s>

<s> the poems are faithful copies from nature and i hope whatever effect they may have upon you you will at least be able to perceive that they may excite profitable sympathies in many kind and good hearts and may in some small degree enlarge our feelings of reverence for our species and our knowledge of human nature by showing that our best qualities are possessed by men whom we are too apt to consider not with reference to the points in which they resemble us but to those in which they manifestly differ from us <\s>

<s> some take no interest in the description of a particular passion or quality as love of solitariness we will say genial activity of fancy love of nature religion and so forth because they have little or nothing of it in themselves and so on without end <\s>
<s> i return then to the question please whom <\s>
<s> i answer human nature as it has been and ever will be <\s>
<s> but where are we to find the best measure of this <\s>
<s> i answer from with in by stripping our own hearts naked and by looking out of ourselves to wards men who lead the simplest lives and most according to nature men who have never known false refinements wayward and artificial desires false criticisms effeminate habits of thinking and feeling or who having known these things have outgrown them <\s>
<s> this latter class is the most to be depended upon but it is very small in number <\s>
<s> people in our rank in life are perpetually falling into one sad mistake namely that of supposing that human nature and the persons they associate with are one and the same thing <\s>
<s> whom do we generally associate with <\s>
<s> gentlemen persons of fortune professional men ladies persons who can afford to buy or can easily procure books of half a guinea price hot pressed and printed upon superfine paper <\s>
<s> these persons are it is true a part of human nature but we err lamentably if we suppose them to be fair representatives of the vast mass of human existence <\s>
<s> and yet few ever consider books but with reference to their power of pleasing these persons and men of a higher rank few descend lower among cottages and fields and among children <\s>
<s> a man must have done this habitually before his judgment upon the idiot boy would be in any way decisive with me <\s>
<s> i know i have done this myself habitually i wrote the poem with exceeding delight and pleasure and whenever i read it i read it with pleasure <\s>
<s> you have given me praise for having reflected faithfully in my poems the feelings of human nature <\s>
<s> i would fain hope that i have done so <\s>
<s> but a great poet ought to do more than this he ought to a certain degree to rectify men's feelings to give them new compositions of feeling to render their feelings more sane pure and permanent in short more consonant to nature that is to eternal nature and the great moving spirit of things <\s>
<s> he ought to travel before men occasionally as well as at their sides <\s>
<s> i may illustrate this by a reference to natural objects <\s>
<s> what false notions have prevailed from generation to generation of the true character of the nightingale <\s>

<s> you will recollect a passage in cowper where speaking of rural sounds he says and even the boding owl that hails the rising moon has charms for me <\s>
<s> cowper was passionately fond of natural objects yet you see he mentions it as a marvellous thing that he could connect pleasure with the cry of the owl <\s>
<s> in the same poem he speaks in the same manner of that beautiful plant the gorse making in some degree an amiable boast of his loving it unsightly and unsmooth as it is <\s>
<s> there are many aversions of this kind which though they have some foundation in nature have yet so slight a one that though they may have prevailed hundreds of years a philosopher will look upon them as accidents <\s>

<s> but you will be inclined to ask by this time how all this applies to the idiot boy <\s>
<s> to this i can only say that the loathing and disgust which many people have at the sight of an idiot is a feeling which though having some foundation in human nature is not necessarily attached to it in any virtuous degree but is owing in a great measure to a false delicacy and if i may say it without rudeness a certain want of comprehensiveness of thinking and feeling <\s>
<s> persons in the lower classes of society have little or nothing of this if an idiot is born in a poor man's house it must be taken care of and cannot be boarded out as it would be by gentlefolks or sent to a public or private receptacle for such unfortunate beings <\s>

<s> i could with pleasure pursue this subject but i must now strictly adopt the plan which i proposed to myself when i began to write this letter namely that of setting down a few hints or memorandums which you will think of for my sake <\s>
<s> i have often applied to idiots in my own mind that sublime expression of scripture that their life is hidden with god they are worshipped probably from a feeling of this sort in several parts of the east <\s>
<s> among the alps where they are numerous they are considered i believe as a blessing to the family to which they belong <\s>
<s> i have indeed often looked upon the conduct of fathers and mothers of the lower classes of society towards idiots as the great triumph of the human heart <\s>
<s> it is there that we see the strength disinterestedness and grandeur of love nor have i ever been able to contemplate an object that calls out so many excellent and virtuous sentiments without finding it hallowed thereby and having something in me which bears down before it like a deluge every feeble sensation of disgust and aversion <\s>
<s> there are in my opinion several important mistakes in the latter part of your letter which i could have wished to notice but i find myself much fatigued <\s>
<s> these refer both to the boy and the mother <\s>
<s> i must content myself simply with observing that it is probable that the principal cause of your dislike to this particular poem lies in the word idiot <\s>

<s> i answer human nature as it has been and ever will be <\s>
<s> but where are we to find the best measure of this <\s>
<s> i answer from with in by stripping our own hearts naked and by looking out of ourselves to wards men who lead the simplest lives and most according to nature men who have never known false refinements wayward and artificial desires false criticisms effeminate habits of thinking and feeling or who having known these things have outgrown them <\s>
<s> this latter class is the most to be depended upon but it is very small in number <\s>
<s> people in our rank in life are perpetually falling into one sad mistake namely that of supposing that human nature and the persons they associate with are one and the same thing <\s>

<s> a man must have done this habitually before his judgment upon the idiot boy would be in any way decisive with me <\s>
<s> i know i have done this myself habitually i wrote the poem with exceeding delight and pleasure and whenever i read it i read it with pleasure <\s>
<s> you have given me praise for having reflected faithfully in my poems the feelings of human nature <\s>
<s> i would fain hope that i have done so <\s>
<s> but a great poet ought to do more than this he ought to a certain degree to rectify men's feelings to give them new compositions of feeling to render their feelings more sane pure and permanent in short more consonant to nature that is to eternal nature and the great moving spirit of things <\s>

<s> to this i can only say that the loathing and disgust which many people have at the sight of an idiot is a feeling which though having some foundation in human nature is not necessarily attached to it in any virtuous degree but is owing in a great measure to a false delicacy and if i may say it without rudeness a certain want of comprehensiveness of thinking and feeling <\s>

<s> then there are professional and national prejudices for evermore <\s>
<s> some take no interest in the description of a particular passion or quality as love of solitariness we will say genial activity of fancy love of nature religion and so forth because they have little or nothing of it in themselves and so on without end <\s>
<s> i return then to the question please whom <\s>
<s> i answer human nature as it has been and ever will be <\s>
<s> but where are we to find the best measure of this <\s>
<s> i answer from with in by stripping our own hearts naked and by looking out of ourselves to wards men who lead the simplest lives and most according to nature men who have never known false refinements wayward and artificial desires false criticisms effeminate habits of thinking and feeling or who having known these things have outgrown them <\s>
<s> this latter class is the most to be depended upon but it is very small in number <\s>
<s> people in our rank in life are perpetually falling into one sad mistake namely that of supposing that human nature and the persons they associate with are one and the same thing <\s>
<s> whom do we generally associate with <\s>
<s> gentlemen persons of fortune professional men ladies persons who can afford to buy or can easily procure books of half a guinea price hot pressed and printed upon superfine paper <\s>
<s> these persons are it is true a part of human nature but we err lamentably if we suppose them to be fair representatives of the vast mass of human existence <\s>
<s> and yet few ever consider books but with reference to their power of pleasing these persons and men of a higher rank few descend lower among cottages and fields and among children <\s>
<s> a man must have done this habitually before his judgment upon the idiot boy would be in any way decisive with me <\s>
<s> i know i have done this myself habitually i wrote the poem with exceeding delight and pleasure and whenever i read it i read it with pleasure <\s>
<s> you have given me praise for having reflected faithfully in my poems the feelings of human nature <\s>
<s> i would fain hope that i have done so <\s>
<s> but a great poet ought to do more than this he ought to a certain degree to rectify men's feelings to give them new compositions of feeling to render their feelings more sane pure and permanent in short more consonant to nature that is to eternal nature and the great moving spirit of things <\s>
<s> he ought to travel before men occasionally as well as at their sides <\s>
<s> i may illustrate this by a reference to natural objects <\s>
<s> what false notions have prevailed from generation to generation of the true character of the nightingale <\s>
<s> as far as my friend's poem in the lyrical ballads is read it will contribute greatly to rectify these <\s>
<s> you will recollect a passage in cowper where speaking of rural sounds he says and even the boding owl that hails the rising moon has charms for me <\s>
<s> cowper was passionately fond of natural objects yet you see he mentions it as a marvellous thing that he could connect pleasure with the cry of the owl <\s>
<s> in the same poem he speaks in the same manner of that beautiful plant the gorse making in some degree an amiable boast of his loving it unsightly and unsmooth as it is <\s>
<s> there are many aversions of this kind which though they have some foundation in nature have yet so slight a one that though they may have prevailed hundreds of years a philosopher will look upon them as accidents <\s>
<s> so with respect to many moral feelings either of love or dislike <\s>
<s> what excessive admiration was paid in former times to personal prowess and military success it is so with the latter even at the present day but surely not nearly so much as heretofore <\s>
<s> so with regard to birth and innumerable other modes of sentiment civil and religious <\s>
<s> but you will be inclined to ask by this time how all this applies to the idiot boy <\s>
<s> to this i can only say that the loathing and disgust which many people have at the sight of an idiot is a feeling which though having some foundation in human nature is not necessarily attached to it in any virtuous degree but is owing in a great measure to a false delicacy and if i may say it without rudeness a certain want of comprehensiveness of thinking and feeling <\s>
<s> persons in the lower classes of society have little or nothing of this if an idiot is born in a poor man's house it must be taken care of and cannot be boarded out as it would be by gentlefolks or sent to a public or private receptacle for such unfortunate beings <\s>
<s> poor people seeing frequently among their neighbours such objects easily forget whatever there is of natural disgust about them and have therefore a sane state so that without pain or suffering they perform their duties towards them <\s>
<s> i could with pleasure pursue this subject but i must now strictly adopt the plan which i proposed to myself when i began to write this letter namely that of setting down a few hints or memorandums which you will think of for my sake <\s>
<s> i have often applied to idiots in my own mind that sublime expression of scripture that their life is hidden with god they are worshipped probably from a feeling of this sort in several parts of the east <\s>
<s> among the alps where they are numerous they are considered i believe as a blessing to the family to which they belong <\s>
<s> i have indeed often looked upon the conduct of fathers and mothers of the lower classes of society towards idiots as the great triumph of the human heart <\s>
<s> it is there that we see the strength disinterestedness and grandeur of love nor have i ever been able to contemplate an object that calls out so many excellent and virtuous sentiments without finding it hallowed thereby and having something in me which bears down before it like a deluge every feeble sensation of disgust and aversion <\s>
<s> there are in my opinion several important mistakes in the latter part of your letter which i could have wished to notice but i find myself much fatigued <\s>
<s> these refer both to the boy and the mother <\s>
<s> i must content myself simply with observing that it is probable that the principal cause of your dislike to this particular poem lies in the word idiot <\s>
<s> if there had been any such word in our language to which we had attached passion as lack wit half wit witless c i should have certainly employed it in preference but there is no such word <\s>

<s> the poems are faithful copies from nature and i hope whatever effect they may have upon you you will at least be able to perceive that they may excite profitable sympathies in many kind and good hearts and may in some small degree enlarge our feelings of reverence for our species and our knowledge of human nature by showing that our best qualities are possessed by men whom we are too apt to consider not with reference to the points in which they resemble us but to those in which they manifestly differ from us <\s>

<s> some take no interest in the description of a particular passion or quality as love of solitariness we will say genial activity of fancy love of nature religion and so forth because they have little or nothing of it in themselves and so on without end <\s>
<s> i return then to the question please whom <\s>
<s> i answer human nature as it has been and ever will be <\s>
<s> but where are we to find the best measure of this <\s>
<s> i answer from with in by stripping our own hearts naked and by looking out of ourselves to wards men who lead the simplest lives and most according to nature men who have never known false refinements wayward and artificial desires false criticisms effeminate habits of thinking and feeling or who having known these things have outgrown them <\s>
<s> this latter class is the most to be depended upon but it is very small in number <\s>
<s> people in our rank in life are perpetually falling into one sad mistake namely that of supposing that human nature and the persons they associate with are one and the same thing <\s>

<s> gentlemen persons of fortune professional men ladies persons who can afford to buy or can easily procure books of half a guinea price hot pressed and printed upon superfine paper <\s>
<s> these persons are it is true a part of human nature but we err lamentably if we suppose them to be fair representatives of the vast mass of human existence <\s>

<s> a man must have done this habitually before his judgment upon the idiot boy would be in any way decisive with me <\s>
<s> i know i have done this myself habitually i wrote the poem with exceeding delight and pleasure and whenever i read it i read it with pleasure <\s>
<s> you have given me praise for having reflected faithfully in my poems the feelings of human nature <\s>
<s> i would fain hope that i have done so <\s>
<s> but a great poet ought to do more than this he ought to a certain degree to rectify men's feelings to give them new compositions of feeling to render their feelings more sane pure and permanent in short more consonant to nature that is to eternal nature and the great moving spirit of things <\s>
<s> he ought to travel before men occasionally as well as at their sides <\s>
<s> i may illustrate this by a reference to natural objects <\s>
<s> what false notions have prevailed from generation to generation of the true character of the nightingale <\s>
<s> as far as my friend's poem in the lyrical ballads is read it will contribute greatly to rectify these <\s>
<s> you will recollect a passage in cowper where speaking of rural sounds he says and even the boding owl that hails the rising moon has charms for me <\s>
<s> cowper was passionately fond of natural objects yet you see he mentions it as a marvellous thing that he could connect pleasure with the cry of the owl <\s>
<s> in the same poem he speaks in the same manner of that beautiful plant the gorse making in some degree an amiable boast of his loving it unsightly and unsmooth as it is <\s>
<s> there are many aversions of this kind which though they have some foundation in nature have yet so slight a one that though they may have prevailed hundreds of years a philosopher will look upon them as accidents <\s>
<s> so with respect to many moral feelings either of love or dislike <\s>
<s> what excessive admiration was paid in former times to personal prowess and military success it is so with the latter even at the present day but surely not nearly so much as heretofore <\s>
<s> so with regard to birth and innumerable other modes of sentiment civil and religious <\s>
<s> but you will be inclined to ask by this time how all this applies to the idiot boy <\s>
<s> to this i can only say that the loathing and disgust which many people have at the sight of an idiot is a feeling which though having some foundation in human nature is not necessarily attached to it in any virtuous degree but is owing in a great measure to a false delicacy and if i may say it without rudeness a certain want of comprehensiveness of thinking and feeling <\s>
<s> persons in the lower classes of society have little or nothing of this if an idiot is born in a poor man's house it must be taken care of and cannot be boarded out as it would be by gentlefolks or sent to a public or private receptacle for such unfortunate beings <\s>
<s> poor people seeing frequently among their neighbours such objects easily forget whatever there is of natural disgust about them and have therefore a sane state so that without pain or suffering they perform their duties towards them <\s>
<s> i could with pleasure pursue this subject but i must now strictly adopt the plan which i proposed to myself when i began to write this letter namely that of setting down a few hints or memorandums which you will think of for my sake <\s>

<s> then there are professional and national prejudices for evermore <\s>
<s> some take no interest in the description of a particular passion or quality as love of solitariness we will say genial activity of fancy love of nature religion and so forth because they have little or nothing of it in themselves and so on without end <\s>
<s> i return then to the question please whom <\s>
<s> i answer human nature as it has been and ever will be <\s>
<s> but where are we to find the best measure of this <\s>
<s> i answer from with in by stripping our own hearts naked and by looking out of ourselves to wards men who lead the simplest lives and most according to nature men who have never known false refinements wayward and artificial desires false criticisms effeminate habits of thinking and feeling or who having known these things have outgrown them <\s>
<s> this latter class is the most to be depended upon but it is very small in number <\s>
<s> people in our rank in life are perpetually falling into one sad mistake namely that of supposing that human nature and the persons they associate with are one and the same thing <\s>
<s> whom do we generally associate with <\s>
<s> gentlemen persons of fortune professional men ladies persons who can afford to buy or can easily procure books of half a guinea price hot pressed and printed upon superfine paper <\s>
<s> these persons are it is true a part of human nature but we err lamentably if we suppose them to be fair representatives of the vast mass of human existence <\s>
<s> and yet few ever consider books but with reference to their power of pleasing these persons and men of a higher rank few descend lower among cottages and fields and among children <\s>
<s> a man must have done this habitually before his judgment upon the idiot boy would be in any way decisive with me <\s>
<s> i know i have done this myself habitually i wrote the poem with exceeding delight and pleasure and whenever i read it i read it with pleasure <\s>
<s> you have given me praise for having reflected faithfully in my poems the feelings of human nature <\s>
<s> i would fain hope that i have done so <\s>
<s> but a great poet ought to do more than this he ought to a certain degree to rectify men's feelings to give them new compositions of feeling to render their feelings more sane pure and permanent in short more consonant to nature that is to eternal nature and the great moving spirit of things <\s>
<s> he ought to travel before men occasionally as well as at their sides <\s>
<s> i may illustrate this by a reference to natural objects <\s>
<s> what false notions have prevailed from generation to generation of the true character of the nightingale <\s>
<s> as far as my friend's poem in the lyrical ballads is read it will contribute greatly to rectify these <\s>
<s> you will recollect a passage in cowper where speaking of rural sounds he says and even the boding owl that hails the rising moon has charms for me <\s>
<s> cowper was passionately fond of natural objects yet you see he mentions it as a marvellous thing that he could connect pleasure with the cry of the owl <\s>
<s> in the same poem he speaks in the same manner of that beautiful plant the gorse making in some degree an amiable boast of his loving it unsightly and unsmooth as it is <\s>
<s> there are many aversions of this kind which though they have some foundation in nature have yet so slight a one that though they may have prevailed hundreds of years a philosopher will look upon them as accidents <\s>
<s> so with respect to many moral feelings either of love or dislike <\s>
<s> what excessive admiration was paid in former times to personal prowess and military success it is so with the latter even at the present day but surely not nearly so much as heretofore <\s>
<s> so with regard to birth and innumerable other modes of sentiment civil and religious <\s>
<s> but you will be inclined to ask by this time how all this applies to the idiot boy <\s>
<s> to this i can only say that the loathing and disgust which many people have at the sight of an idiot is a feeling which though having some foundation in human nature is not necessarily attached to it in any virtuous degree but is owing in a great measure to a false delicacy and if i may say it without rudeness a certain want of comprehensiveness of thinking and feeling <\s>
<s> persons in the lower classes of society have little or nothing of this if an idiot is born in a poor man's house it must be taken care of and cannot be boarded out as it would be by gentlefolks or sent to a public or private receptacle for such unfortunate beings <\s>
<s> poor people seeing frequently among their neighbours such objects easily forget whatever there is of natural disgust about them and have therefore a sane state so that without pain or suffering they perform their duties towards them <\s>
<s> i could with pleasure pursue this subject but i must now strictly adopt the plan which i proposed to myself when i began to write this letter namely that of setting down a few hints or memorandums which you will think of for my sake <\s>
<s> i have often applied to idiots in my own mind that sublime expression of scripture that their life is hidden with god they are worshipped probably from a feeling of this sort in several parts of the east <\s>
<s> among the alps where they are numerous they are considered i believe as a blessing to the family to which they belong <\s>
<s> i have indeed often looked upon the conduct of fathers and mothers of the lower classes of society towards idiots as the great triumph of the human heart <\s>
<s> it is there that we see the strength disinterestedness and grandeur of love nor have i ever been able to contemplate an object that calls out so many excellent and virtuous sentiments without finding it hallowed thereby and having something in me which bears down before it like a deluge every feeble sensation of disgust and aversion <\s>
<s> there are in my opinion several important mistakes in the latter part of your letter which i could have wished to notice but i find myself much fatigued <\s>
<s> these refer both to the boy and the mother <\s>
<s> i must content myself simply with observing that it is probable that the principal cause of your dislike to this particular poem lies in the word idiot <\s>
<s> if there had been any such word in our language to which we had attached passion as lack wit half wit witless c i should have certainly employed it in preference but there is no such word <\s>
<s> observe this is entirely in reference to this particular poem my idiot is not one of those who cannot articulate and such as are usually disgusting in their persons whether in cunning or in joy and then his words were not a few c and the last speech at the end of the poem <\s>

<s> 43 entitled resolution and independence <\s>
<s> and again on the same poem i will explain to you in prose my feelings in writing that poem .... <\s>
<s> i describe myself as having been exalted to the highest pitch of delight by the joyousness and beauty of nature and then as depressed even in the midst of those beautiful objects to the lowest dejection and despair <\s>
<s> a young poet in the midst of the happiness of nature is described as overwhelmed by the thoughts of the miserable reverses which have befallen the happiest of all men viz <\s>
<s> i think of this till i am so deeply impressed with it that i consider the manner in which i was rescued from my dejection and despair almost as an interposition of providence <\s>

<s> thought i or what can he be doing <\s>
<s> i then describe him whether ill or well is not for me to judge with perfect confidence but this i can confidently affirm that though i believe god has given me a strong imagination i cannot conceive a figure more impressive than that of an old man like this the survivor of a wife and ten children travelling alone among the mountains and all lonely places carrying with him his own fortitude and the necessities which an unjust state of society has laid upon him <\s>
<s> you speak of his speech as tedious <\s>
<s> everything is tedious when one does not read with the feelings of the author <\s>

<s> my dear sir had it not been for a very amiable modesty you could not have imagined that your letter could give me any offence <\s>
<s> it was on many accounts highly grateful to me <\s>
<s> i was pleased to find that i had given so much pleasure to an ingenuous and able mind and i further considered the enjoyment which you had had from my poems as an earnest that others might be delighted with them in the same or a like manner <\s>
<s> it is plain from your letter that the pleasure which i have given you has not been blind or unthinking you have studied the poems and prove that you have entered into the spirit of them <\s>
<s> they have not given you a cheap or vulgar pleasure therefore i feel that you are entitled to my kindest thanks for having done some violence to your natural diffidence in the communication which you have made to me <\s>
<s> there is scarcely any part of your letter that does not deserve particular notice but partly from some constitutional infirmities and partly from certain habits of mind i do not write any letters unless upon business not even to my dearest friends <\s>
<s> except during absence from my own family i have not written five letters of friendship during the last five years <\s>
<s> i have mentioned this in order that i may retain your good opinion should my letter be less minute than you are entitled to expect <\s>
<s> you seem to be desirous of my opinion on the influence of natural objects in forming the character of nations <\s>
<s> this cannot be understood without first considering their influence upon men in general first with reference to such objects as are common to all countries and next such as belong exclusively to any particular country or in a greater degree to it than to another <\s>
<s> now it is manifest that no human being can be so besotted and debased by oppression penury or any other evil which unhumanises man as to be utterly insensible to the colours forms or smell of flowers the voices 45 and motions of birds and beasts the appearances of the sky and heavenly bodies the general warmth of a fine day the terror and uncomfortableness of a storm c <\s>
<s> how dead soever many full grown men may outwardly seem to these things all are more or less affected by them and in childhood in the first practice and exercise of their senses they must have been not the nourishers merely but often the fathers of their passions <\s>
<s> there cannot be a doubt that in tracts of country where images of danger melancholy grandeur or loveliness softness and ease prevail that they will make themselves felt powerfully in forming the characters of the people so as to produce an uniformity or national character where the nation is small and is not made up of men who inhabiting different soils climates c by their civil usages and relations materially interfere with each other <\s>
<s> it was so formerly no doubt in the highlands of scotland but we cannot perhaps observe much of it in our own island at the present day because even in the most sequestered places by manufactures traffic religion law interchange of inhabitants c distinctions are done away which would otherwise have been strong and obvious <\s>
<s> this complex state of society does not however prevent the characters of individuals from frequently receiving a strong bias not merely from the impressions of general nature but also from local objects and images <\s>
<s> but it seems that to produce these effects in the degree in which we frequently find them to be produced there must be a peculiar sensibility of original organisation combining with moral accidents as is exhibited in the brothers and in ruth i mean to produce this in a marked degree not that i believe that any man was ever brought up in the country without loving it especially in his better moments or in a district of particular grandeur or beauty without feeling some stronger attachment to it on that account than he would otherwise have felt <\s>
<s> i include you will observe in these considerations the influence of climate changes in the atmosphere and elements and the labours and occupations which particular districts require <\s>
<s> 45 parts of this letter have been torn and words have been lost some of which are here conjecturally supplied between brackets <\s>
<s> you begin what you say upon the idiot boy with this observation that nothing is a fit subject for poetry which does not please <\s>
<s> but here follows a question does not please whom <\s>
<s> some have little knowledge of natural imagery of any kind and of course little relish for it some are disgusted with the very mention of the words pastoral poetry sheep or shepherds some cannot tolerate a poem with a ghost or any supernatural agency in it others would shrink from an animated description of the pleasures of love as from a thing carnal and libidinous some cannot bear to see delicate and refined feelings ascribed to men in low conditions in society because their vanity and self love tell them that these belong only to themselves and men like themselves in dress station and way of life others are disgusted with the naked language of some of the most interesting passions of men because either it is indelicate or gross or vulgar as many fine ladies could not bear certain expressions in the mother and the thorn and as in the instance of adam smith who we are told could not endure the ballad of clym of the clough because the author had not written like a gentleman <\s>
<s> then there are professional and national prejudices for evermore <\s>
<s> some take no interest in the description of a particular passion or quality as love of solitariness we will say genial activity of fancy love of nature religion and so forth because they have little or nothing of it in themselves and so on without end <\s>
<s> i return then to the question please whom <\s>
<s> i answer human nature as it has been and ever will be <\s>
<s> but where are we to find the best measure of this <\s>
<s> i answer from with in by stripping our own hearts naked and by looking out of ourselves to wards men who lead the simplest lives and most according to nature men who have never known false refinements wayward and artificial desires false criticisms effeminate habits of thinking and feeling or who having known these things have outgrown them <\s>
<s> this latter class is the most to be depended upon but it is very small in number <\s>
<s> people in our rank in life are perpetually falling into one sad mistake namely that of supposing that human nature and the persons they associate with are one and the same thing <\s>
<s> whom do we generally associate with <\s>
<s> gentlemen persons of fortune professional men ladies persons who can afford to buy or can easily procure books of half a guinea price hot pressed and printed upon superfine paper <\s>
<s> these persons are it is true a part of human nature but we err lamentably if we suppose them to be fair representatives of the vast mass of human existence <\s>
<s> and yet few ever consider books but with reference to their power of pleasing these persons and men of a higher rank few descend lower among cottages and fields and among children <\s>
<s> a man must have done this habitually before his judgment upon the idiot boy would be in any way decisive with me <\s>
<s> i know i have done this myself habitually i wrote the poem with exceeding delight and pleasure and whenever i read it i read it with pleasure <\s>
<s> you have given me praise for having reflected faithfully in my poems the feelings of human nature <\s>
<s> i would fain hope that i have done so <\s>
<s> but a great poet ought to do more than this he ought to a certain degree to rectify men's feelings to give them new compositions of feeling to render their feelings more sane pure and permanent in short more consonant to nature that is to eternal nature and the great moving spirit of things <\s>
<s> he ought to travel before men occasionally as well as at their sides <\s>
<s> i may illustrate this by a reference to natural objects <\s>
<s> what false notions have prevailed from generation to generation of the true character of the nightingale <\s>
<s> as far as my friend's poem in the lyrical ballads is read it will contribute greatly to rectify these <\s>
<s> you will recollect a passage in cowper where speaking of rural sounds he says and even the boding owl that hails the rising moon has charms for me <\s>
<s> cowper was passionately fond of natural objects yet you see he mentions it as a marvellous thing that he could connect pleasure with the cry of the owl <\s>
<s> in the same poem he speaks in the same manner of that beautiful plant the gorse making in some degree an amiable boast of his loving it unsightly and unsmooth as it is <\s>
<s> there are many aversions of this kind which though they have some foundation in nature have yet so slight a one that though they may have prevailed hundreds of years a philosopher will look upon them as accidents <\s>
<s> so with respect to many moral feelings either of love or dislike <\s>
<s> what excessive admiration was paid in former times to personal prowess and military success it is so with the latter even at the present day but surely not nearly so much as heretofore <\s>
<s> so with regard to birth and innumerable other modes of sentiment civil and religious <\s>
<s> but you will be inclined to ask by this time how all this applies to the idiot boy <\s>
<s> to this i can only say that the loathing and disgust which many people have at the sight of an idiot is a feeling which though having some foundation in human nature is not necessarily attached to it in any virtuous degree but is owing in a great measure to a false delicacy and if i may say it without rudeness a certain want of comprehensiveness of thinking and feeling <\s>
<s> persons in the lower classes of society have little or nothing of this if an idiot is born in a poor man's house it must be taken care of and cannot be boarded out as it would be by gentlefolks or sent to a public or private receptacle for such unfortunate beings <\s>
<s> poor people seeing frequently among their neighbours such objects easily forget whatever there is of natural disgust about them and have therefore a sane state so that without pain or suffering they perform their duties towards them <\s>
<s> i could with pleasure pursue this subject but i must now strictly adopt the plan which i proposed to myself when i began to write this letter namely that of setting down a few hints or memorandums which you will think of for my sake <\s>
<s> i have often applied to idiots in my own mind that sublime expression of scripture that their life is hidden with god they are worshipped probably from a feeling of this sort in several parts of the east <\s>
<s> among the alps where they are numerous they are considered i believe as a blessing to the family to which they belong <\s>
<s> i have indeed often looked upon the conduct of fathers and mothers of the lower classes of society towards idiots as the great triumph of the human heart <\s>
<s> it is there that we see the strength disinterestedness and grandeur of love nor have i ever been able to contemplate an object that calls out so many excellent and virtuous sentiments without finding it hallowed thereby and having something in me which bears down before it like a deluge every feeble sensation of disgust and aversion <\s>
<s> there are in my opinion several important mistakes in the latter part of your letter which i could have wished to notice but i find myself much fatigued <\s>
<s> these refer both to the boy and the mother <\s>
<s> i must content myself simply with observing that it is probable that the principal cause of your dislike to this particular poem lies in the word idiot <\s>
<s> if there had been any such word in our language to which we had attached passion as lack wit half wit witless c i should have certainly employed it in preference but there is no such word <\s>
<s> observe this is entirely in reference to this particular poem my idiot is not one of those who cannot articulate and such as are usually disgusting in their persons whether in cunning or in joy and then his words were not a few c and the last speech at the end of the poem <\s>
<s> ideoque imperitis quoque si modo sint aliquo affectu concitati verba non desunt <\s>
<s> the poems are faithful copies from nature and i hope whatever effect they may have upon you you will at least be able to perceive that they may excite profitable sympathies in many kind and good hearts and may in some small degree enlarge our feelings of reverence for our species and our knowledge of human nature by showing that our best qualities are possessed by men whom we are too apt to consider not with reference to the points in which they resemble us but to those in which they manifestly differ from us <\s>
<s> i thought at a time when these feelings are sapped in so many ways that the two poems might co operate however feebly with the illustrious efforts which you have made to stem this and other evils with which the country is labouring and it is on this account alone that i have taken the liberty of thus addressing you <\s>

<s> wordsworth 41 fox's reply was as follows sir i owe you many apologies for having so long deferred thanking you for your poems and your obliging letter accompanying them which i received early in march <\s>
<s> the poems have given me the greatest pleasure and if i were obliged to choose out of them i do not know whether i should not say that harry gill we are seven the mad mother and the idiot are my favourites <\s>
<s> i read with particular attention the two you pointed out but whether it be from early prepossessions or whatever other cause i am no great friend to blank verse for subjects which are to be treated of with simplicity <\s>

<s> how dead soever many full grown men may outwardly seem to these things all are more or less affected by them and in childhood in the first practice and exercise of their senses they must have been not the nourishers merely but often the fathers of their passions <\s>

<s> some take no interest in the description of a particular passion or quality as love of solitariness we will say genial activity of fancy love of nature religion and so forth because they have little or nothing of it in themselves and so on without end <\s>
<s> i return then to the question please whom <\s>
<s> i answer human nature as it has been and ever will be <\s>
<s> but where are we to find the best measure of this <\s>
<s> i answer from with in by stripping our own hearts naked and by looking out of ourselves to wards men who lead the simplest lives and most according to nature men who have never known false refinements wayward and artificial desires false criticisms effeminate habits of thinking and feeling or who having known these things have outgrown them <\s>
<s> this latter class is the most to be depended upon but it is very small in number <\s>
<s> people in our rank in life are perpetually falling into one sad mistake namely that of supposing that human nature and the persons they associate with are one and the same thing <\s>
<s> whom do we generally associate with <\s>
<s> gentlemen persons of fortune professional men ladies persons who can afford to buy or can easily procure books of half a guinea price hot pressed and printed upon superfine paper <\s>
<s> these persons are it is true a part of human nature but we err lamentably if we suppose them to be fair representatives of the vast mass of human existence <\s>
<s> and yet few ever consider books but with reference to their power of pleasing these persons and men of a higher rank few descend lower among cottages and fields and among children <\s>
<s> a man must have done this habitually before his judgment upon the idiot boy would be in any way decisive with me <\s>
<s> i know i have done this myself habitually i wrote the poem with exceeding delight and pleasure and whenever i read it i read it with pleasure <\s>
<s> you have given me praise for having reflected faithfully in my poems the feelings of human nature <\s>
<s> i would fain hope that i have done so <\s>
<s> but a great poet ought to do more than this he ought to a certain degree to rectify men's feelings to give them new compositions of feeling to render their feelings more sane pure and permanent in short more consonant to nature that is to eternal nature and the great moving spirit of things <\s>
<s> he ought to travel before men occasionally as well as at their sides <\s>
<s> i may illustrate this by a reference to natural objects <\s>
<s> what false notions have prevailed from generation to generation of the true character of the nightingale <\s>
<s> as far as my friend's poem in the lyrical ballads is read it will contribute greatly to rectify these <\s>
<s> you will recollect a passage in cowper where speaking of rural sounds he says and even the boding owl that hails the rising moon has charms for me <\s>
<s> cowper was passionately fond of natural objects yet you see he mentions it as a marvellous thing that he could connect pleasure with the cry of the owl <\s>
<s> in the same poem he speaks in the same manner of that beautiful plant the gorse making in some degree an amiable boast of his loving it unsightly and unsmooth as it is <\s>
<s> there are many aversions of this kind which though they have some foundation in nature have yet so slight a one that though they may have prevailed hundreds of years a philosopher will look upon them as accidents <\s>
<s> so with respect to many moral feelings either of love or dislike <\s>
<s> what excessive admiration was paid in former times to personal prowess and military success it is so with the latter even at the present day but surely not nearly so much as heretofore <\s>
<s> so with regard to birth and innumerable other modes of sentiment civil and religious <\s>
<s> but you will be inclined to ask by this time how all this applies to the idiot boy <\s>
<s> to this i can only say that the loathing and disgust which many people have at the sight of an idiot is a feeling which though having some foundation in human nature is not necessarily attached to it in any virtuous degree but is owing in a great measure to a false delicacy and if i may say it without rudeness a certain want of comprehensiveness of thinking and feeling <\s>
<s> persons in the lower classes of society have little or nothing of this if an idiot is born in a poor man's house it must be taken care of and cannot be boarded out as it would be by gentlefolks or sent to a public or private receptacle for such unfortunate beings <\s>
<s> poor people seeing frequently among their neighbours such objects easily forget whatever there is of natural disgust about them and have therefore a sane state so that without pain or suffering they perform their duties towards them <\s>
<s> i could with pleasure pursue this subject but i must now strictly adopt the plan which i proposed to myself when i began to write this letter namely that of setting down a few hints or memorandums which you will think of for my sake <\s>
<s> i have often applied to idiots in my own mind that sublime expression of scripture that their life is hidden with god they are worshipped probably from a feeling of this sort in several parts of the east <\s>
<s> among the alps where they are numerous they are considered i believe as a blessing to the family to which they belong <\s>
<s> i have indeed often looked upon the conduct of fathers and mothers of the lower classes of society towards idiots as the great triumph of the human heart <\s>
<s> it is there that we see the strength disinterestedness and grandeur of love nor have i ever been able to contemplate an object that calls out so many excellent and virtuous sentiments without finding it hallowed thereby and having something in me which bears down before it like a deluge every feeble sensation of disgust and aversion <\s>
<s> there are in my opinion several important mistakes in the latter part of your letter which i could have wished to notice but i find myself much fatigued <\s>
<s> these refer both to the boy and the mother <\s>
<s> i must content myself simply with observing that it is probable that the principal cause of your dislike to this particular poem lies in the word idiot <\s>
<s> if there had been any such word in our language to which we had attached passion as lack wit half wit witless c i should have certainly employed it in preference but there is no such word <\s>

<s> the poems are faithful copies from nature and i hope whatever effect they may have upon you you will at least be able to perceive that they may excite profitable sympathies in many kind and good hearts and may in some small degree enlarge our feelings of reverence for our species and our knowledge of human nature by showing that our best qualities are possessed by men whom we are too apt to consider not with reference to the points in which they resemble us but to those in which they manifestly differ from us <\s>

<s> some take no interest in the description of a particular passion or quality as love of solitariness we will say genial activity of fancy love of nature religion and so forth because they have little or nothing of it in themselves and so on without end <\s>
<s> i return then to the question please whom <\s>
<s> i answer human nature as it has been and ever will be <\s>
<s> but where are we to find the best measure of this <\s>
<s> i answer from with in by stripping our own hearts naked and by looking out of ourselves to wards men who lead the simplest lives and most according to nature men who have never known false refinements wayward and artificial desires false criticisms effeminate habits of thinking and feeling or who having known these things have outgrown them <\s>
<s> this latter class is the most to be depended upon but it is very small in number <\s>
<s> people in our rank in life are perpetually falling into one sad mistake namely that of supposing that human nature and the persons they associate with are one and the same thing <\s>
<s> whom do we generally associate with <\s>
<s> gentlemen persons of fortune professional men ladies persons who can afford to buy or can easily procure books of half a guinea price hot pressed and printed upon superfine paper <\s>
<s> these persons are it is true a part of human nature but we err lamentably if we suppose them to be fair representatives of the vast mass of human existence <\s>
<s> and yet few ever consider books but with reference to their power of pleasing these persons and men of a higher rank few descend lower among cottages and fields and among children <\s>
<s> a man must have done this habitually before his judgment upon the idiot boy would be in any way decisive with me <\s>
<s> i know i have done this myself habitually i wrote the poem with exceeding delight and pleasure and whenever i read it i read it with pleasure <\s>
<s> you have given me praise for having reflected faithfully in my poems the feelings of human nature <\s>
<s> i would fain hope that i have done so <\s>
<s> but a great poet ought to do more than this he ought to a certain degree to rectify men's feelings to give them new compositions of feeling to render their feelings more sane pure and permanent in short more consonant to nature that is to eternal nature and the great moving spirit of things <\s>
<s> he ought to travel before men occasionally as well as at their sides <\s>
<s> i may illustrate this by a reference to natural objects <\s>
<s> what false notions have prevailed from generation to generation of the true character of the nightingale <\s>

<s> you will recollect a passage in cowper where speaking of rural sounds he says and even the boding owl that hails the rising moon has charms for me <\s>
<s> cowper was passionately fond of natural objects yet you see he mentions it as a marvellous thing that he could connect pleasure with the cry of the owl <\s>
<s> in the same poem he speaks in the same manner of that beautiful plant the gorse making in some degree an amiable boast of his loving it unsightly and unsmooth as it is <\s>
<s> there are many aversions of this kind which though they have some foundation in nature have yet so slight a one that though they may have prevailed hundreds of years a philosopher will look upon them as accidents <\s>

<s> but you will be inclined to ask by this time how all this applies to the idiot boy <\s>
<s> to this i can only say that the loathing and disgust which many people have at the sight of an idiot is a feeling which though having some foundation in human nature is not necessarily attached to it in any virtuous degree but is owing in a great measure to a false delicacy and if i may say it without rudeness a certain want of comprehensiveness of thinking and feeling <\s>
<s> persons in the lower classes of society have little or nothing of this if an idiot is born in a poor man's house it must be taken care of and cannot be boarded out as it would be by gentlefolks or sent to a public or private receptacle for such unfortunate beings <\s>

<s> i could with pleasure pursue this subject but i must now strictly adopt the plan which i proposed to myself when i began to write this letter namely that of setting down a few hints or memorandums which you will think of for my sake <\s>
<s> i have often applied to idiots in my own mind that sublime expression of scripture that their life is hidden with god they are worshipped probably from a feeling of this sort in several parts of the east <\s>
<s> among the alps where they are numerous they are considered i believe as a blessing to the family to which they belong <\s>
<s> i have indeed often looked upon the conduct of fathers and mothers of the lower classes of society towards idiots as the great triumph of the human heart <\s>
<s> it is there that we see the strength disinterestedness and grandeur of love nor have i ever been able to contemplate an object that calls out so many excellent and virtuous sentiments without finding it hallowed thereby and having something in me which bears down before it like a deluge every feeble sensation of disgust and aversion <\s>
<s> there are in my opinion several important mistakes in the latter part of your letter which i could have wished to notice but i find myself much fatigued <\s>
<s> these refer both to the boy and the mother <\s>
<s> i must content myself simply with observing that it is probable that the principal cause of your dislike to this particular poem lies in the word idiot <\s>

<s> i answer human nature as it has been and ever will be <\s>
<s> but where are we to find the best measure of this <\s>
<s> i answer from with in by stripping our own hearts naked and by looking out of ourselves to wards men who lead the simplest lives and most according to nature men who have never known false refinements wayward and artificial desires false criticisms effeminate habits of thinking and feeling or who having known these things have outgrown them <\s>
<s> this latter class is the most to be depended upon but it is very small in number <\s>
<s> people in our rank in life are perpetually falling into one sad mistake namely that of supposing that human nature and the persons they associate with are one and the same thing <\s>

<s> a man must have done this habitually before his judgment upon the idiot boy would be in any way decisive with me <\s>
<s> i know i have done this myself habitually i wrote the poem with exceeding delight and pleasure and whenever i read it i read it with pleasure <\s>
<s> you have given me praise for having reflected faithfully in my poems the feelings of human nature <\s>
<s> i would fain hope that i have done so <\s>
<s> but a great poet ought to do more than this he ought to a certain degree to rectify men's feelings to give them new compositions of feeling to render their feelings more sane pure and permanent in short more consonant to nature that is to eternal nature and the great moving spirit of things <\s>

<s> to this i can only say that the loathing and disgust which many people have at the sight of an idiot is a feeling which though having some foundation in human nature is not necessarily attached to it in any virtuous degree but is owing in a great measure to a false delicacy and if i may say it without rudeness a certain want of comprehensiveness of thinking and feeling <\s>

<s> then there are professional and national prejudices for evermore <\s>
<s> some take no interest in the description of a particular passion or quality as love of solitariness we will say genial activity of fancy love of nature religion and so forth because they have little or nothing of it in themselves and so on without end <\s>
<s> i return then to the question please whom <\s>
<s> i answer human nature as it has been and ever will be <\s>
<s> but where are we to find the best measure of this <\s>
<s> i answer from with in by stripping our own hearts naked and by looking out of ourselves to wards men who lead the simplest lives and most according to nature men who have never known false refinements wayward and artificial desires false criticisms effeminate habits of thinking and feeling or who having known these things have outgrown them <\s>
<s> this latter class is the most to be depended upon but it is very small in number <\s>
<s> people in our rank in life are perpetually falling into one sad mistake namely that of supposing that human nature and the persons they associate with are one and the same thing <\s>
<s> whom do we generally associate with <\s>
<s> gentlemen persons of fortune professional men ladies persons who can afford to buy or can easily procure books of half a guinea price hot pressed and printed upon superfine paper <\s>
<s> these persons are it is true a part of human nature but we err lamentably if we suppose them to be fair representatives of the vast mass of human existence <\s>
<s> and yet few ever consider books but with reference to their power of pleasing these persons and men of a higher rank few descend lower among cottages and fields and among children <\s>
<s> a man must have done this habitually before his judgment upon the idiot boy would be in any way decisive with me <\s>
<s> i know i have done this myself habitually i wrote the poem with exceeding delight and pleasure and whenever i read it i read it with pleasure <\s>
<s> you have given me praise for having reflected faithfully in my poems the feelings of human nature <\s>
<s> i would fain hope that i have done so <\s>
<s> but a great poet ought to do more than this he ought to a certain degree to rectify men's feelings to give them new compositions of feeling to render their feelings more sane pure and permanent in short more consonant to nature that is to eternal nature and the great moving spirit of things <\s>
<s> he ought to travel before men occasionally as well as at their sides <\s>
<s> i may illustrate this by a reference to natural objects <\s>
<s> what false notions have prevailed from generation to generation of the true character of the nightingale <\s>
<s> as far as my friend's poem in the lyrical ballads is read it will contribute greatly to rectify these <\s>
<s> you will recollect a passage in cowper where speaking of rural sounds he says and even the boding owl that hails the rising moon has charms for me <\s>
<s> cowper was passionately fond of natural objects yet you see he mentions it as a marvellous thing that he could connect pleasure with the cry of the owl <\s>
<s> in the same poem he speaks in the same manner of that beautiful plant the gorse making in some degree an amiable boast of his loving it unsightly and unsmooth as it is <\s>
<s> there are many aversions of this kind which though they have some foundation in nature have yet so slight a one that though they may have prevailed hundreds of years a philosopher will look upon them as accidents <\s>
<s> so with respect to many moral feelings either of love or dislike <\s>
<s> what excessive admiration was paid in former times to personal prowess and military success it is so with the latter even at the present day but surely not nearly so much as heretofore <\s>
<s> so with regard to birth and innumerable other modes of sentiment civil and religious <\s>
<s> but you will be inclined to ask by this time how all this applies to the idiot boy <\s>
<s> to this i can only say that the loathing and disgust which many people have at the sight of an idiot is a feeling which though having some foundation in human nature is not necessarily attached to it in any virtuous degree but is owing in a great measure to a false delicacy and if i may say it without rudeness a certain want of comprehensiveness of thinking and feeling <\s>
<s> persons in the lower classes of society have little or nothing of this if an idiot is born in a poor man's house it must be taken care of and cannot be boarded out as it would be by gentlefolks or sent to a public or private receptacle for such unfortunate beings <\s>
<s> poor people seeing frequently among their neighbours such objects easily forget whatever there is of natural disgust about them and have therefore a sane state so that without pain or suffering they perform their duties towards them <\s>
<s> i could with pleasure pursue this subject but i must now strictly adopt the plan which i proposed to myself when i began to write this letter namely that of setting down a few hints or memorandums which you will think of for my sake <\s>
<s> i have often applied to idiots in my own mind that sublime expression of scripture that their life is hidden with god they are worshipped probably from a feeling of this sort in several parts of the east <\s>
<s> among the alps where they are numerous they are considered i believe as a blessing to the family to which they belong <\s>
<s> i have indeed often looked upon the conduct of fathers and mothers of the lower classes of society towards idiots as the great triumph of the human heart <\s>
<s> it is there that we see the strength disinterestedness and grandeur of love nor have i ever been able to contemplate an object that calls out so many excellent and virtuous sentiments without finding it hallowed thereby and having something in me which bears down before it like a deluge every feeble sensation of disgust and aversion <\s>
<s> there are in my opinion several important mistakes in the latter part of your letter which i could have wished to notice but i find myself much fatigued <\s>
<s> these refer both to the boy and the mother <\s>
<s> i must content myself simply with observing that it is probable that the principal cause of your dislike to this particular poem lies in the word idiot <\s>
<s> if there had been any such word in our language to which we had attached passion as lack wit half wit witless c i should have certainly employed it in preference but there is no such word <\s>

<s> the poems are faithful copies from nature and i hope whatever effect they may have upon you you will at least be able to perceive that they may excite profitable sympathies in many kind and good hearts and may in some small degree enlarge our feelings of reverence for our species and our knowledge of human nature by showing that our best qualities are possessed by men whom we are too apt to consider not with reference to the points in which they resemble us but to those in which they manifestly differ from us <\s>

<s> some take no interest in the description of a particular passion or quality as love of solitariness we will say genial activity of fancy love of nature religion and so forth because they have little or nothing of it in themselves and so on without end <\s>
<s> i return then to the question please whom <\s>
<s> i answer human nature as it has been and ever will be <\s>
<s> but where are we to find the best measure of this <\s>
<s> i answer from with in by stripping our own hearts naked and by looking out of ourselves to wards men who lead the simplest lives and most according to nature men who have never known false refinements wayward and artificial desires false criticisms effeminate habits of thinking and feeling or who having known these things have outgrown them <\s>
<s> this latter class is the most to be depended upon but it is very small in number <\s>
<s> people in our rank in life are perpetually falling into one sad mistake namely that of supposing that human nature and the persons they associate with are one and the same thing <\s>

<s> gentlemen persons of fortune professional men ladies persons who can afford to buy or can easily procure books of half a guinea price hot pressed and printed upon superfine paper <\s>
<s> these persons are it is true a part of human nature but we err lamentably if we suppose them to be fair representatives of the vast mass of human existence <\s>

<s> a man must have done this habitually before his judgment upon the idiot boy would be in any way decisive with me <\s>
<s> i know i have done this myself habitually i wrote the poem with exceeding delight and pleasure and whenever i read it i read it with pleasure <\s>
<s> you have given me praise for having reflected faithfully in my poems the feelings of human nature <\s>
<s> i would fain hope that i have done so <\s>
<s> but a great poet ought to do more than this he ought to a certain degree to rectify men's feelings to give them new compositions of feeling to render their feelings more sane pure and permanent in short more consonant to nature that is to eternal nature and the great moving spirit of things <\s>
<s> he ought to travel before men occasionally as well as at their sides <\s>
<s> i may illustrate this by a reference to natural objects <\s>
<s> what false notions have prevailed from generation to generation of the true character of the nightingale <\s>
<s> as far as my friend's poem in the lyrical ballads is read it will contribute greatly to rectify these <\s>
<s> you will recollect a passage in cowper where speaking of rural sounds he says and even the boding owl that hails the rising moon has charms for me <\s>
<s> cowper was passionately fond of natural objects yet you see he mentions it as a marvellous thing that he could connect pleasure with the cry of the owl <\s>
<s> in the same poem he speaks in the same manner of that beautiful plant the gorse making in some degree an amiable boast of his loving it unsightly and unsmooth as it is <\s>
<s> there are many aversions of this kind which though they have some foundation in nature have yet so slight a one that though they may have prevailed hundreds of years a philosopher will look upon them as accidents <\s>
<s> so with respect to many moral feelings either of love or dislike <\s>
<s> what excessive admiration was paid in former times to personal prowess and military success it is so with the latter even at the present day but surely not nearly so much as heretofore <\s>
<s> so with regard to birth and innumerable other modes of sentiment civil and religious <\s>
<s> but you will be inclined to ask by this time how all this applies to the idiot boy <\s>
<s> to this i can only say that the loathing and disgust which many people have at the sight of an idiot is a feeling which though having some foundation in human nature is not necessarily attached to it in any virtuous degree but is owing in a great measure to a false delicacy and if i may say it without rudeness a certain want of comprehensiveness of thinking and feeling <\s>
<s> persons in the lower classes of society have little or nothing of this if an idiot is born in a poor man's house it must be taken care of and cannot be boarded out as it would be by gentlefolks or sent to a public or private receptacle for such unfortunate beings <\s>
<s> poor people seeing frequently among their neighbours such objects easily forget whatever there is of natural disgust about them and have therefore a sane state so that without pain or suffering they perform their duties towards them <\s>
<s> i could with pleasure pursue this subject but i must now strictly adopt the plan which i proposed to myself when i began to write this letter namely that of setting down a few hints or memorandums which you will think of for my sake <\s>

<s> 43 entitled resolution and independence <\s>
<s> and again on the same poem i will explain to you in prose my feelings in writing that poem .... <\s>

<s> some take no interest in the description of a particular passion or quality as love of solitariness we will say genial activity of fancy love of nature religion and so forth because they have little or nothing of it in themselves and so on without end <\s>
<s> i return then to the question please whom <\s>
<s> i answer human nature as it has been and ever will be <\s>
<s> but where are we to find the best measure of this <\s>
<s> i answer from with in by stripping our own hearts naked and by looking out of ourselves to wards men who lead the simplest lives and most according to nature men who have never known false refinements wayward and artificial desires false criticisms effeminate habits of thinking and feeling or who having known these things have outgrown them <\s>
<s> this latter class is the most to be depended upon but it is very small in number <\s>
<s> people in our rank in life are perpetually falling into one sad mistake namely that of supposing that human nature and the persons they associate with are one and the same thing <\s>
<s> whom do we generally associate with <\s>
<s> gentlemen persons of fortune professional men ladies persons who can afford to buy or can easily procure books of half a guinea price hot pressed and printed upon superfine paper <\s>
<s> these persons are it is true a part of human nature but we err lamentably if we suppose them to be fair representatives of the vast mass of human existence <\s>
<s> and yet few ever consider books but with reference to their power of pleasing these persons and men of a higher rank few descend lower among cottages and fields and among children <\s>
<s> a man must have done this habitually before his judgment upon the idiot boy would be in any way decisive with me <\s>
<s> i know i have done this myself habitually i wrote the poem with exceeding delight and pleasure and whenever i read it i read it with pleasure <\s>
<s> you have given me praise for having reflected faithfully in my poems the feelings of human nature <\s>
<s> i would fain hope that i have done so <\s>
<s> but a great poet ought to do more than this he ought to a certain degree to rectify men's feelings to give them new compositions of feeling to render their feelings more sane pure and permanent in short more consonant to nature that is to eternal nature and the great moving spirit of things <\s>
<s> he ought to travel before men occasionally as well as at their sides <\s>
<s> i may illustrate this by a reference to natural objects <\s>
<s> what false notions have prevailed from generation to generation of the true character of the nightingale <\s>
<s> as far as my friend's poem in the lyrical ballads is read it will contribute greatly to rectify these <\s>
<s> you will recollect a passage in cowper where speaking of rural sounds he says and even the boding owl that hails the rising moon has charms for me <\s>
<s> cowper was passionately fond of natural objects yet you see he mentions it as a marvellous thing that he could connect pleasure with the cry of the owl <\s>
<s> in the same poem he speaks in the same manner of that beautiful plant the gorse making in some degree an amiable boast of his loving it unsightly and unsmooth as it is <\s>
<s> there are many aversions of this kind which though they have some foundation in nature have yet so slight a one that though they may have prevailed hundreds of years a philosopher will look upon them as accidents <\s>
<s> so with respect to many moral feelings either of love or dislike <\s>
<s> what excessive admiration was paid in former times to personal prowess and military success it is so with the latter even at the present day but surely not nearly so much as heretofore <\s>
<s> so with regard to birth and innumerable other modes of sentiment civil and religious <\s>
<s> but you will be inclined to ask by this time how all this applies to the idiot boy <\s>
<s> to this i can only say that the loathing and disgust which many people have at the sight of an idiot is a feeling which though having some foundation in human nature is not necessarily attached to it in any virtuous degree but is owing in a great measure to a false delicacy and if i may say it without rudeness a certain want of comprehensiveness of thinking and feeling <\s>
<s> persons in the lower classes of society have little or nothing of this if an idiot is born in a poor man's house it must be taken care of and cannot be boarded out as it would be by gentlefolks or sent to a public or private receptacle for such unfortunate beings <\s>
<s> poor people seeing frequently among their neighbours such objects easily forget whatever there is of natural disgust about them and have therefore a sane state so that without pain or suffering they perform their duties towards them <\s>
<s> i could with pleasure pursue this subject but i must now strictly adopt the plan which i proposed to myself when i began to write this letter namely that of setting down a few hints or memorandums which you will think of for my sake <\s>
<s> i have often applied to idiots in my own mind that sublime expression of scripture that their life is hidden with god they are worshipped probably from a feeling of this sort in several parts of the east <\s>
<s> among the alps where they are numerous they are considered i believe as a blessing to the family to which they belong <\s>
<s> i have indeed often looked upon the conduct of fathers and mothers of the lower classes of society towards idiots as the great triumph of the human heart <\s>
<s> it is there that we see the strength disinterestedness and grandeur of love nor have i ever been able to contemplate an object that calls out so many excellent and virtuous sentiments without finding it hallowed thereby and having something in me which bears down before it like a deluge every feeble sensation of disgust and aversion <\s>
<s> there are in my opinion several important mistakes in the latter part of your letter which i could have wished to notice but i find myself much fatigued <\s>
<s> these refer both to the boy and the mother <\s>
<s> i must content myself simply with observing that it is probable that the principal cause of your dislike to this particular poem lies in the word idiot <\s>
<s> if there had been any such word in our language to which we had attached passion as lack wit half wit witless c i should have certainly employed it in preference but there is no such word <\s>

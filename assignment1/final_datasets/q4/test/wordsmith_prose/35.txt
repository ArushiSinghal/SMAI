<s> i took it with me intending to answer it upon the road but i had not courage to undertake the office on account of the inquiries it contains concerning my family <\s>
<s> i will be brief on this melancholy subject <\s>
<s> in the course of the last year i have lost two sweet children a girl and a boy at the ages of four and six and a half <\s>

<s> i quit this sorrowful subject secure of your sympathy as a father and as my friend <\s>
<s> my employment i find salutary to me and of consequence in a pecuniary point of view as my literary employments bring me no remuneration nor promise any <\s>
<s> as to what you say about the ministry i very much prefer the course of their policy to that of the opposition especially on two points most near my heart resistance of buonaparte by force of arms and their adherence to the principles of the british constitution in withholding political power from the roman catholics <\s>
<s> my most determined hostility shall always be directed against those statesmen who like whitbread grenville and others would crouch to a sanguinary tyrant and i cannot act with those who see no danger to the constitution in introducing papists into parliament <\s>
<s> there are other points of policy in which i deem the opposition grievously mistaken and therefore i am at present and long have been by principle a supporter of ministers as far as my little influence extends <\s>

<s> i did not notice a single sentiment or opinion that i could have wished away but one where you support the notion that if the duke of wellington had not lived and commanded buonaparte must have continued the master of europe <\s>
<s> i do not object to this from any dislike i have to the duke but from a conviction i trust a philosophic one that providence would not allow the upsetting of so diabolical a system as buonaparte's to depend upon the existence of any individual <\s>

<s> letter to a friend 1821 <\s>
<s> in the year 1821 october 7 an old friend of wordsworth thus writes to him they tell me you have changed your opinions upon many subjects respecting which we used to think alike but i am persuaded we shall neither of us change those great principles which ought to guide us in our conduct and lead us to do all the good we can to others <\s>
<s> and i am much mistaken if we should not find many things to talk about without disturbing ourselves with political or party disputes <\s>
<s> to this wordsworth answered as follows rydal mount dec <\s>
<s> my dear l your letter ought to have been much earlier acknowledged and would have been so had i not been sure you would ascribe my silence to its true cause viz <\s>
<s> procrastination and not to indifference to your kind attention <\s>
<s> there was another feeling which both urged and indisposed me to write to you i mean the allusion which in so friendly a manner you make to a supposed change in my political opinions <\s>
<s> to the scribblers in pamphlets and periodical publications who have heaped so much obloquy upon myself and my friends coleridge and southey i have not condescended to reply nor ever shall but to you my candid and enlightened friend i will say a few words on this subject which if we have the good fortune to meet again as i hope we may will probably be further dwelt upon <\s>
<s> i should think that i had lived to little purpose if my notions on the subject of government had undergone no modification my youth must in that case have been without enthusiasm and my manhood endued with small capability of profiting by reflection <\s>
<s> if i were addressing those who have dealt so liberally with the words renegade apostate c i should retort the charge upon them and say you have been deluded by places and persons while i have stuck to principles <\s>
<s> i abandoned france and her rulers when they abandoned the struggle for liberty gave themselves up to tyranny and endeavoured to enslave the world <\s>
<s> i disapproved of the war against france at its commencement thinking which was perhaps an error that it might have been avoided but after buonaparte had violated the independence of switzerland my heart turned against him and against the nation that could submit to be the instrument of such an outrage <\s>
<s> here it was that i parted in feeling from the whigs and to a certain degree united with their adversaries who were free from the delusion such i must ever regard it of mr <\s>
<s> fox and his party that a safe and honourable peace was practicable with the french nation and that an ambitious conqueror like buonaparte could be softened down into a commercial rival <\s>
<s> in a determination therefore to aim at the overthrow of that inordinate ambition by war i sided with the ministry not from general approbation of their conduct but as men who thought right on this essential point <\s>
<s> how deeply this question interested me will be plain to any one who will take the trouble of reading my political sonnets and the tract occasioned by the convention of cintra in which are sufficient evidences of my dissatisfaction with the mode of conducting the war and a prophetic display of the course which it would take if carried on upon the principles of justice and with due respect for the feelings of the oppressed nations <\s>
<s> this is enough for foreign politics as influencing my attachments <\s>
<s> there are three great domestic questions viz <\s>
<s> the liberty of the press parliamentary reform and roman catholic concession which if i briefly advert to no more need be said at present <\s>
<s> a free discussion of public measures through the press i deem the only safeguard of liberty without it i have neither confidence in kings parliaments judges or divines they have all in their turn betrayed their country <\s>
<s> but the press so potent for good is scarcely less so for evil and unfortunately they who are misled and abused by its means are the persons whom it can least benefit <\s>
<s> it is the fatal characteristic of their disease to reject all remedies coming from the quarter that has caused or aggravated the malady <\s>
<s> i am therefore for vigorous restrictions but there is scarcely any abuse that i would not endure rather than sacrifice or even endanger this freedom <\s>
<s> when i was young giving myself credit for qualities which i did not possess and measuring mankind by that standard i thought it derogatory to human nature to set up property in preference to person as a title for legislative power <\s>
<s> that notion has vanished <\s>
<s> i now perceive many advantages in our present complex system of representation which formerly eluded my observation this has tempered my ardour for reform but if any plan could be contrived for throwing the representation fairly into the hands of the property of the country and not leaving it so much in the hands of the large proprietors as it now is it should have my best support though even in that event there would be a sacrifice of personal rights independent of property that are now frequently exercised for the benefit of the community <\s>
<s> be not startled when i say that i am averse to further concessions to the roman catholics <\s>
<s> my reasons are that such concessions will not produce harmony among the roman catholics themselves that they among them who are most clamorous for the measure care little about it but as a step first to the overthrow of the protestant establishment in ireland as introductory to a separation of the two countries their ultimate aim that i cannot consent to take the character of a religion from the declaration of powerful professors of it disclaiming doctrines imputed to that religion that taking its character from what it actually teaches to the great mass i believe the roman catholic religion to be unchanged in its doctrines and unsoftened in its spirit how can it be otherwise unless the doctrine of infallibility be given up <\s>
<s> that such concessions would set all other dissenters in motion an issue which has never fairly been met by the friends to concession and deeming the church establishment not only a fundamental part of our constitution but one of the greatest upholders and propagators of civilization in our own country and lastly the most effectual and main support of religious toleration i cannot but look with jealousy upon measures which must reduce her relative influence unless they be accompanied with arrangements more adequate than any yet adopted for the preservation and increase of that influence to keep pace with the other powers in the community <\s>
<s> i do not apologise for this long letter the substance of which you may report to any one worthy of a reply who in your hearing may animadvert upon my political conduct <\s>
<s> i ought to have added perhaps a word on local politics but i have not space but what i should have said may in a great measure be deduced from the above <\s>
